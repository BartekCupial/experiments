        "Based on the image and the game description, I can see that we are in a Boxoban-style puzzle. There are three boulders (represented by orange circles) and three fountains (represented by blue symbols). The goal is to push the boulders onto the fountains. The player character is represented by the @ symbol.\n\nGiven the current position, the best move appears to be:\n\nsouth\n\nThis will move the player character towards the boulder directly south, which can then be pushed towards one of the fountains. This is a good first step in solving the puzzle."
