        "Based on the image and the game description, I can see that we are playing Boxoban, a box-pushing puzzle game. The goal is to push the boulders (orange circles) onto the fountains (blue circles with white centers).\n\nOur character (represented by the '@' symbol) is currently positioned near the center of the map. There's a boulder directly to the southeast of our position.\n\nTo make progress, we should try to push this boulder towards one of the fountains. The nearest fountain appears to be directly to the east of our current position.\n\nTherefore, the best action to take now would be:\n\neast\n\nThis will move our character to the east, which will push the boulder one step closer to the fountain.",
