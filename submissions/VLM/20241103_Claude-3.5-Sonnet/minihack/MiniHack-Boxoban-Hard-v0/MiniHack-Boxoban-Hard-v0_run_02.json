        "Based on the image and the game description, I can see that we're in a Boxoban-style puzzle. The goal is to push the boulders (orange circles) onto the fountains (blue circles with white centers). \n\nOur character (represented by the white '@' symbol) is currently positioned with a boulder to the north and northeast, and a fountain to the east. To make progress, we should try to push a boulder towards a fountain.\n\nThe most logical first move would be to push the boulder to the north onto the fountain to the east. To do this, we need to move north, which will push the boulder east onto the fountain.\n\nAction: north",
