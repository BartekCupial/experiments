        "Based on the current observation and the image provided, I'll analyze the situation and choose an action:\n\n1. The active rule is \"baba is you\", which means we control the white character (Baba).\n2. Our goal is typically to reach the \"WIN\" condition, but we need to create that rule first.\n3. We can see the \"is\" and \"win\" text blocks near the top of the level.\n4. To create the win condition, we need to move a noun (like \"key\" or \"ball\") next to the \"is win\" text.\n\nThe most efficient path to start solving this puzzle is to move up towards the \"is\" and \"win\" text blocks. This will allow us to potentially create a new win condition.\n\nAction: up",
