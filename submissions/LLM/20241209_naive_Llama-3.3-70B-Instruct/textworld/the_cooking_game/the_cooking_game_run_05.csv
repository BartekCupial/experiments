77,go west,,"-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

78,go west,,"-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one.

You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a patio chair. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table. You make out a BBQ.

There is an open patio door leading east. There is a closed wooden door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.
