You've entered a pantry.

You see a shelf. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a shelf, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Look over there! a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

79,go west,,"-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
