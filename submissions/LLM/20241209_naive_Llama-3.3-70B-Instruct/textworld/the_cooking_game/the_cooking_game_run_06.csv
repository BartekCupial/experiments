You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty.

There is a closed front door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You've entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north.

Wow! You're in a livingroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty.

There is a closed front door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well.
