Wow! You're in a livingroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty.

There is a closed front door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Well, here we are in a bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You're now in the bathroom.

Were you looking for a toilet? Because look over there, it's a toilet. The toilet is white. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld.

You've entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You make out a table! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north.
