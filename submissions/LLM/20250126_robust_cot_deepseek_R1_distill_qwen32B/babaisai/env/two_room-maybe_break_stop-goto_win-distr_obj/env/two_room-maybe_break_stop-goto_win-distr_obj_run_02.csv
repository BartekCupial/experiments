Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""door is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the door is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step up from my current position. But there are walls around it, so I can't just walk up to it. The walls are two steps to the right and various steps up and down. There's also a ball four steps to the right and one down. Hmm, maybe the ball can be used somehow.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a 'door' rule five steps to the right and two up, followed by 'is' and 'win' rules next to it. Similarly, there are 'baba', 'is', and 'you' rules four steps down and to the left. Maybe I can rearrange these to change the rules.

Since I can't move through walls, I need to find a way to either remove them or change their properties. The walls are currently 'stop', so they block movement. If I can change that, maybe I can pass through them.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see a 'wall' rule three steps to the left and one up, followed by 'is' and 'stop' rules. If I can move the 'stop' part away from 'wall', maybe the walls won't block anymore. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like 'wall is push' or something else.

But how do I move those rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't 'stop'. Since the walls are 'stop', I can't move them directly. Maybe I can move the rule blocks instead. For example, if I can move the 'stop' rule away from 'wall', the walls might become passable.

Let me plan my moves. I'm currently at the starting position. The door is one step up, but there's a wall there. To the right, there are walls two steps up and down. The ball is four steps right and one down. Maybe I can move the ball to break something.

Wait, the ball is an object. If I can push it, maybe it can break a wall or move a rule block. But I'm not sure if the ball can be moved. Let me check the rules again. The active rules don't mention the ball, so it's probably just an object that can be moved if possible.

I think the key is to rearrange the rule blocks to change the properties of the walls. If I can make 'wall is not stop', then I can walk through them. Alternatively, I could make 'wall is push' so I can push them aside.

Looking at the rule blocks, the 'wall' rule is three steps left and one up, followed by 'is' and 'stop' two steps left and one up. If I can move the 'stop' rule somewhere else, maybe the walls won't block. But how do I move the 'stop' rule? I need to move the 'is' and 'stop' blocks.

Wait, the 'is' rule is two steps left and one up. If I can move the 'is' block, I can separate 'wall' from 'stop'. Let me try to move the 'is' block. But to do that, I need to get to it. It's two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule.

I'm currently at the starting point. Let me see the layout. The 'wall' rule is three steps left and one up. So, to reach it, I need to move left three times and up once. But there are walls in the way. Hmm, maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is seven steps right and two up. If I can move that, perhaps I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Wait, the door is the current win condition. If I can make the door not be win, maybe I can win another way. But that might complicate things. Let me focus on the walls first.

I think the best approach is to move the 'stop' rule away from 'wall'. To do that, I need to move the 'is' and 'stop' blocks. Let me try to move the 'is' block first. It's two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule. So, from my starting position, I need to move left three steps and up one to get to the 'wall' rule, then left one more step and up one to get to the 'is' rule.

But wait, moving left three steps from my current position would take me to the 'wall' rule's position. Then, moving left again would take me to the 'is' rule. But I can't move through walls, so I need to find a path that doesn't involve walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first. The door is one step up, but there's a wall there. So I can't go up directly. Maybe I can go right first. There are walls two steps to the right and various steps up and down. Let me see: two steps right and one up is a wall, two steps right is a wall, two steps right and one down is a wall, and so on. So going right might not be helpful.

Wait, the ball is four steps right and one down. Maybe I can move right four times and down once to get to the ball. Then, perhaps I can push the ball to break a wall or move a rule block.

But I'm not sure if the ball can be pushed. Let me think: if I can move the ball, I might be able to use it to knock down a wall or move a rule block. But I need to get to the ball first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'baba' rule. The 'baba' rule is three steps left and four steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can change what 'baba' is. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the 'baba' rule is three left and four down, followed by 'is' and 'you' rules. So, if I can move the 'you' rule, maybe I can change who I am. But that might complicate things.

I think the most straightforward approach is to try to change the 'wall' rule. Let me try to move the 'is' rule that's part of 'wall is stop'. To do that, I need to get to the 'is' rule. It's two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule, which is three steps left and one up from my starting position.

So, from my starting position, I need to move left three times and up once to reach the 'wall' rule. Then, moving left again and up once would get me to the 'is' rule. But I can't move through walls, so I need to find a path that doesn't involve walls.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. The door is one step up, but there's a wall there. So I can't go up directly. Maybe I can go right first. Let me see: moving right once, then up once, but there's a wall two steps right and two up. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can go down first. There's a wall two steps right and one down. So, moving right twice and down once would take me to that wall. But I can't move through walls, so that's not helpful.

Wait, the ball is four steps right and one down. Maybe I can go right four times and down once to reach the ball. Let me try that.

So, from my starting position, I move right four times: right, right, right, right. Then down once. That should get me to the ball. Now, can I move the ball? Since the ball isn't defined as 'stop', I can move it.

Once I have the ball, maybe I can push it to break a wall or move a rule block. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to reach a rule block.

Wait, the 'win' rule is seven steps right and two up. If I can move the ball there, maybe I can change the win condition. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball to the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is one step left and one up from the 'is' rule, which is two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule. So, if I can get the ball to the 'stop' rule, maybe I can push it away.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the door, making the door the win condition, but that's already the case.

Wait, the door is already 'win', so maybe I can just reach it. But the walls are blocking me. So I need to find a way to get past the walls.

Another idea: if I can make 'wall is push', then I can push the walls aside. To do that, I need to rearrange the rule blocks. The 'wall' rule is three left and one up, followed by 'is' and 'stop'. If I can move the 'stop' to somewhere else and put 'push' instead, that would work.

But how do I get 'push'? I don't see a 'push' rule on the map. Hmm, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the 'is' and 'win' blocks.

Wait, the 'win' rule is seven right and two up. If I can move the 'win' block to the 'wall' rule, making 'wall is win', but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can make 'wall is you', but that would make me a wall, which might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can make 'baba is win', so I can win by being myself. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the 'baba' rule is three left and four down, followed by 'is' and 'you'. If I can move the 'you' rule, maybe I can change what 'baba' is. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to try to move the 'stop' rule away from 'wall'. Let me try to get to the 'is' rule that's part of 'wall is stop'. So, from my starting position, I need to move left three times and up once to reach the 'wall' rule. Then, moving left again and up once to reach the 'is' rule.

But I can't move through walls, so I need to find a way around. Maybe I can go down first. Let me try moving down once. There's a wall two steps right and one down, but I'm moving down from my starting position, so maybe I can go down and then right.

Wait, from my starting position, moving down once would take me to a position where there's a wall two steps right and one down. So, I can't move there. Maybe I can move right first.

Let me try moving right once. Then, up once. But there's a wall two steps right and two up, so I can't go there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right twice and down once to get past the walls. Let me try that. Right, right, down. Now I'm at the position of the wall two steps right and one down. But I can't move through walls, so I can't go further.

Wait, maybe I can move the ball. The ball is four steps right and one down. So, if I can get to the ball, I can push it. Let me try moving right four times and down once. That should get me to the ball.

Once I'm at the ball, I can push it. But where? Maybe I can push it to the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is one step left and one up from the 'is' rule, which is two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule.

So, if I can push the ball to the 'stop' rule, maybe I can move it away. Let me try that.

From the ball's position, I need to move left three times and up twice to reach the 'stop' rule. But that's a long way. Maybe I can push the ball step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball to the 'is' rule and then move the 'is' rule away from 'wall'.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rules are 'door is win', 'wall is stop', and 'baba is you'. I need to change 'wall is stop' to something else. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away from 'wall'.

The 'stop' rule is one step left and one up from the 'is' rule, which is two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule. So, the 'stop' rule is three steps left and two up from the 'wall' rule.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate. The 'wall' rule is three left and one up. The 'is' rule is two left and one up from the 'wall' rule, so that's five left and two up from my starting position. The 'stop' rule is one left and one up from the 'is' rule, so that's six left and three up.

Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can move the 'stop' rule by moving the 'is' rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is seven right and two up. If I can move it to the 'stop' position, maybe I can change the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move the 'is' rule. To do that, I need to get to it. It's two left and one up from the 'wall' rule, which is three left and one up from my starting position. So, from my starting position, I need to move left three times and up once to reach the 'wall' rule. Then, left two more times and up once to reach the 'is' rule.

But I can't move through walls, so I need to find a path that doesn't involve walls. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. The door is one step up, but there's a wall there. So I can't go up directly. Maybe I can go right first.

Let me try moving right once. Then, up once. But there's a wall two steps right and two up, so I can't go there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right twice and down once to get past the walls. Let me try that. Right, right, down. Now I'm at the position of the wall two steps right and one down. But I can't move through walls, so I can't go further.

Wait, maybe I can move the ball. The ball is four steps right and one down. So, if I can get to the ball, I can push it. Let me try moving right four times and down once. That should get me to the ball.

Once I'm at the ball, I can push it. But where? Maybe I can push it to the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is one step left and one up from the 'is' rule, which is two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule.

So, if I can push the ball to the 'stop' rule, maybe I can move it away. Let me try that.

From the ball's position, I need to move left three times and up twice to reach the 'stop' rule. But that's a long way. Maybe I can push the ball step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball to the 'is' rule and then move the 'is' rule away from 'wall'.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rules are 'door is win', 'wall is stop', and 'baba is you'. I need to change 'wall is stop' to something else. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away from 'wall'.

The 'stop' rule is one step left and one up from the 'is' rule, which is two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule. So, the 'stop' rule is three steps left and two up from the 'wall' rule.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate. The 'wall' rule is three left and one up. The 'is' rule is two left and one up from the 'wall' rule, so that's five left and two up from my starting position. The 'stop' rule is one left and one up from the 'is' rule, so that's six left and three up.

Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can move the 'stop' rule by moving the 'is' rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is seven right and two up. If I can move it to the 'stop' position, maybe I can change the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move the 'is' rule. To do that, I need to get to it. It's two left and one up from the 'wall' rule, which is three left and one up from my starting position. So, from my starting position, I need to move left three times and up once to reach the 'wall' rule. Then, left two more times and up once to reach the 'is' rule.

But I can't move through walls, so I need to find a path that doesn't involve walls. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. The door is one step up, but there's a wall there. So I can't go up directly. Maybe I can go right first.

Let me try moving right once. Then, up once. But there's a wall two steps right and two up, so I can't go there. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ball. The ball is four steps right and one down. So, if I can get to the ball, I can push it. Let me try moving right four times and down once. That should get me to the ball.

Once I'm at the ball, I can push it. But where? Maybe I can push it to the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is one step left and one up from the 'is' rule, which is two steps left and one up from the 'wall' rule.

So, if I can push the ball to the 'stop' rule, maybe I can move it away. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""door is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the door is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step up from my current position. But there are walls around it, so I can't just walk up to it. The walls are two steps to the right and two steps up, which probably blocks my path. There are also some rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a 'door' rule five steps to the right and two up, followed by 'is' and 'win' rules next to it. On the left side, there are 'wall', 'is', and 'stop' rules. 

I think the key here is to rearrange the rule blocks to change the rules. Maybe if I can move the 'door' rule next to 'win', I can make the door the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can change what counts as a wall or stop.

Wait, the ball is four steps to the right and one down. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls? But I don't know if the ball has any special properties. Or perhaps I can move the 'stop' rule away from the walls, making them passable.

Let me think about the rules. If I can move the 'stop' rule away from the walls, then walls won't stop me anymore. That would allow me to walk through them. So, how can I do that? I need to move the 'stop' rule block. It's currently one step to the left and one step up. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe the walls will no longer be stop.

But to move the 'stop' rule, I need to be able to reach it. Right now, I'm at the starting position, and the 'stop' rule is to the left and up. Are there any walls blocking me from getting there? Let me check the map again. There are walls two steps to the right and two up, but I'm trying to go left and up. So maybe I can move left first.

Wait, I'm Baba, and the walls are stop, so I can't move through them. But if I can change the rules before moving, maybe I can make the walls not stop. Hmm, that's a bit of a catch-22. I need to change the rules to move through walls, but to change the rules, I might need to move to where the rule blocks are, which are behind walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'baba' rule to change what I am. If I can make myself into a different object, like a ball or something that can pass through walls, that could help. The 'baba' rule is three steps to the left and four down. If I can move that, perhaps I can redefine myself.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can only move myself. Maybe I can move the 'is' and 'you' rules to change my properties. For example, if I can make 'baba is ball', then I can move like a ball, which might have different properties.

Let me try to plan this out. I need to get to the 'stop' rule to move it. To do that, I might need to change the rules so that walls aren't stop anymore. But how? Maybe I can move the 'is' and 'stop' rules to create a new rule like 'wall is not stop' or something. But I'm not sure how that works in the game.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'door' rule next to 'win' to make the door the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's necessary because the door is already win. Wait, the active rule is 'door is win', so the door is already the win condition. So I just need to reach the door.

But the door is one step up, but there's a wall two steps up and two right. So maybe I need to move around the walls. Let me see the layout. If I move right two steps, I can go around the wall, but there are walls two steps right and up, so that might not work. Alternatively, moving down first to get around.

Wait, the ball is four steps right and one down. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. But I don't know if the ball can push walls or break them. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball to the door to trigger something.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. The rules are made up of text blocks. If I can move the 'is' and 'win' blocks next to the door, maybe I can reinforce the 'door is win' rule, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the 'baba' and 'you' blocks. If I can make 'baba is not you', then maybe I can change my properties. Or perhaps 'baba is win', making myself the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule next to something else to change the win condition. For example, if I can make 'ball is win', then the ball becomes the win condition, and I just need to reach the ball instead of the door.

But the ball is four steps right and one down. If I can get there, maybe I can use it. But again, the walls are in the way.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to make walls not stop. If I can move the 'stop' rule block away from the walls, then walls won't block me anymore. So how can I do that? I need to move the 'stop' rule block, which is one step left and one up. But to get there, I might need to move left and up, but there are walls in the way.

Hmm, perhaps I can move the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make 'wall is not stop', that would allow me to pass through walls. But I'm not sure how to do that exactly.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' and 'stop' blocks to create a new rule. If I can place 'wall' next to 'is' and 'not stop', but I'm not sure if 'not' is a valid property.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a different subject. For example, if I can make 'ball is stop', then the ball would block movement, but I don't know if that helps.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the steps I need to take. First, I need to change the rules so that I can move through walls or find another way to reach the door. To do that, I need to move the rule blocks, but they are behind walls. So maybe I need to find a way to move the rule blocks without moving through walls.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'baba' rule to change myself into something else. If I can make 'baba is ball', then I can move like a ball, which might have different properties, like pushing objects or moving through walls.

But how do I move the 'baba' rule? It's three steps left and four down. I need to get there, but the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move down first to get around.

Wait, if I move down, I can go around the walls. Let me see: moving down one step, then right, but there are walls two steps right and down. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, moving left first. If I move left, I can get to the 'is' and 'stop' rules. But the walls are two steps right and up, so moving left might be possible.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me try to move left. If I move left, I can get to the 'is' rule two steps left and one up. But there's a wall two steps right and up, so moving left might not be blocked.

Wait, no, the walls are two steps right and up, so moving left from my position shouldn't be blocked. So I can move left, then up to reach the 'is' and 'stop' rules.

So, first, I move left. Then, I can move up to get to the 'is' and 'stop' rules. Once there, I can move the 'stop' rule block away, making walls not stop anymore.

Alternatively, I can move the 'is' and 'stop' blocks to create a new rule. For example, moving 'wall' next to 'is' and 'not stop' to make 'wall is not stop'.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move the 'stop' rule block to a different location, so the walls no longer have the stop property.

Once I've done that, I can move through the walls and reach the door to win.

So, the plan is: move left to reach the 'is' and 'stop' rules, then move the 'stop' rule block away, making walls passable. Then, move up to the door and win.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move the 'stop' rule block. How do I do that? I think I can move it by moving into it, as long as it's not blocked by other rules.

So, first, I move left to get to the 'is' rule. Then, I can move up to get to the 'stop' rule. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like down or right, to break the 'wall is stop' rule.

Once that's done, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'wall' rule block to change what walls are. But I'm not sure.

I think the best course of action is to move left to reach the 'is' and 'stop' rules, then move the 'stop' rule block away to make walls passable. Then, I can move up to the door and win.

So, the first step is to move left. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""door is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" That means the door is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step to the right and one step up. There are also several walls around, and a ball somewhere. The rules are spread out in the upper part of the map, with ""door,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" placed in specific locations.

My goal is to reach the door to win. But since the door is the win condition, I need to get to it. However, there are walls blocking my path. The walls are set to stop, so I can't move through them. I need to find a way to change the rules to make the walls passable or find another way to reach the door.

I notice that the rules are made up of text blocks. If I can move these blocks, I can change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, they might no longer block me. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes the walls something else, like ""win"" or ""you,"" but that might not be necessary.

Looking at the positions, the ""stop"" rule is one step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop anymore. But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba, and I can move around, I can pick up and move these rule blocks.

Wait, but to change a rule, I need to have the subject and property adjacent. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""is"" and then next to something else, I can change the rule. So maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to be next to ""is"" and then next to ""not stop"" or something. But I don't see a ""not"" block, so that might not work.

Alternatively, I can try to break the existing rule. If I separate ""wall"" from ""is stop,"" then the rule might be removed. So, if I move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall is,"" then walls might no longer be stop. That could allow me to move through them.

Let me plan the steps. I need to get to the ""stop"" rule. It's one step up. So from my current position, I can move up once to reach it. But wait, is there a wall in the way? The door is one step right and up, so maybe I need to move right first.

Wait, the door is at (right 1, up 1). If I move right, I might hit a wall. Let me check the objects. There's a wall two steps to the right and two steps up. So moving right might not be straightforward. Maybe I should move up first to get closer to the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to get to the rule blocks. The ""baba"" rule is two steps left and four steps down. That's far, but maybe I can go there to change my own properties.

Wait, if I change ""baba is you"" to something else, that might not be good because I need to control Baba. So perhaps it's better to focus on changing the wall rules.

Let me try to move up to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. So, I'll move up once. Now, I'm one step up. The ""stop"" rule is one step up from there, so I can move up again. But is there a wall blocking me? The wall is two steps right and two steps up, so maybe not directly in my path.

Wait, the wall is two steps right and two steps up, so if I'm moving up, I might not hit it yet. So moving up twice would get me to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall is."" Maybe I can move it to the side, so the rule is broken.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" block to be next to ""is"" and then next to something else, like ""win,"" but that might not help. Or maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" but that would make the walls controllable, which might not be useful.

Wait, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I could push them, but I don't see a ""push"" rule. So that's not possible. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but again, no ""not"" block.

So the best bet is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving either ""wall"" or ""stop"" away. Let's try moving the ""stop"" block. I'll move up twice to reach it, then move it to the right or left to break the rule.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls will no longer block me, allowing me to move through them. Then I can reach the door to win.

So the steps would be: move up twice to get to the ""stop"" rule, then move it to the right or left to break the rule. Then, move through the walls to reach the door.

But wait, I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't create a new rule that's bad. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to another subject, it might create a new rule I don't want. So I should move it to an empty space.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule away. The ""wall"" rule is two steps left and one step up. So if I move left twice and up once, I can get to the ""wall"" rule and move it away, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Either way, the goal is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule so I can move through the walls.

So, to start, I'll move up once to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Then up again to reach it. Then move it to the right or left to break the rule.

Let me try that. First, move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the door is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""stop"" rule one step up. That probably means if I move up, I'll hit a stop, which might block me. Then there are walls and other rules scattered around. The door is one step to the right, which is good because that's where I need to go to win. 

Wait, but there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. If I move right, I might run into that wall. Also, there's a ball five steps to the right and two steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does, but maybe it's just an obstacle. 

I think the key here is to get to the door. Since the door is one step to the right, maybe I can just move right. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking that path. Let me check the objects again. The wall is three steps to the right and one step up, so if I move right once, I should be clear of that wall. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to avoid the ""stop"" rule, but that might not be necessary. I'm not sure if moving up would help or hinder me. The door is directly to the right, so moving right seems like the most straightforward path. 

I should also consider if there are any other rules I can manipulate. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, it might clear the way. But since I'm Baba, I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""stop."" So I can't move the ""stop"" rule itself unless I change the rules. 

Wait, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block. If I can move ""stop"" away from the wall, then the walls won't block me anymore. But how? I need to move the ""stop"" rule. Let me see where it is. It's one step up. So if I move up, I can grab the ""stop"" rule. 

But if I move up, I might hit the wall that's three steps to the right and one step up. Hmm, maybe I should first move right to get closer to the door and then see if I can manipulate the rules from there. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make it the win condition without needing to go through the door. But that might complicate things. 

I think the simplest solution is to move right to reach the door. Let me try that. If I move right once, I should be at the door and win the level. 

Wait, but what if the door is blocked by something? Let me check the objects again. The door is one step to the right, and there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. So moving right once should be clear. 

I think I'll go with moving right. Let's try that.
