Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You level. Let me see what I have here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means right now, the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall one step to the right and four steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: 'ball' is four right and four up, 'is' is five right and four up, 'win' is six right and four up. Also, there's a 'wall' rule four left and three up, and a 'stop' rule two left and three up. There are more walls and some other rules below.

Hmm, the key is two left and one down, and the ball is one left and one down. There's also a wall one right and one down. The rules 'baba', 'is', and 'you' are further down.

So, my goal is to reach the ball to win, but maybe I can change the rules to make it easier. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me see where I can go.

I think the key is near me, two left and one down. Maybe I can pick up the key to unlock something. But wait, the key might not be necessary if I can change the rules.

Looking at the rules, if I can move the 'ball' rule, maybe I can change what is considered a win. For example, if I make 'baba is win' instead, then I can just reach the win condition by being somewhere else.

Alternatively, I can try to move the 'is' and 'win' rules to create a new rule. Let's say I move 'baba' next to 'is' and 'win' to make 'baba is win.' That would mean I become the win condition, so I just need to reach the exit or wherever the win is.

Wait, but the current win is the ball. So if I make 'baba is win,' then I can win by being in the win position. But where is the win position? It's the ball's location, but if I change the rule, maybe I can just reach the exit.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to make some walls passable. The 'stop' rule is two left and three up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls not stop me.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the layout. The walls are on the right side, so maybe I can go around them. The key is to the left and down, so maybe I can go there first.

Wait, the key is two left and one down. So from my starting position, I can move left twice and down once to get the key. Then, maybe the key can open a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe the key is for another purpose.

Alternatively, maybe the key is part of a rule. The key is an object, so perhaps I can use it to break a wall or something. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the rules again. The 'ball' is the win, so I need to reach it. The ball is one left and one down. So if I can get to that position, I can win. But are there walls blocking me?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall one right and four up, which is above me. Then walls at one right and three up, two up, one up, and one down. So the right side is blocked by walls, but maybe I can go around.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. If I'm at (0,0), then the wall is at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), and (1,-1). So the right side has walls from y=1 to y=4 and y=-1. So I can't go right beyond x=1 because of the walls.

But I can go left. The key is at (-2, -1), so two left and one down. So I can move left twice and down once to get the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to do something.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the 'is' and 'win' blocks to make a new rule like 'baba is win,' then I can win by being somewhere else.

But to do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule, which is four left and two down. So I need to get to that position. But that's quite far. Maybe I can first get the key and then proceed.

Wait, maybe the key is not necessary. Let me see. If I can move the 'ball' rule, I can change the win condition. For example, if I move 'ball' next to 'stop,' making 'ball is stop,' then the ball becomes a stop block, which might block something.

Alternatively, if I can move 'win' next to 'baba,' making 'baba is win,' then I can win by being in the win position. But where is the win position? It's the ball's location, but if I change the rule, maybe I can just reach the exit.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' block to create a new rule. For example, if I move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win,' making 'baba is win.' That would change the win condition to me.

So, to do that, I need to move the 'is' block from its current position. The 'is' blocks are at (5,4), (2,0), (3,-2), and (2,-2). Hmm, maybe I can move the 'is' at (2,0) next to 'baba' which is at (-4,2). That's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' block to make a new rule. The 'win' block is at (6,4). If I can move it next to 'baba,' that would make 'baba is win.'

But moving the 'win' block from (6,4) to (-4,2) is a long way. Maybe I can find a closer 'is' block.

Wait, the 'is' block at (2,0) is closer. If I can move that to be next to 'baba' at (-4,2), that would require moving it left by 6 steps and up by 2 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'baba' rule to be next to an 'is' and 'win' block. The 'baba' rule is at (-4,2). If I can move it to be next to 'is' at (2,0), that would require moving it right by 6 steps and down by 2 steps. That's also a lot.

Hmm, maybe there's a better approach. Let me think about the key. The key is at (-2,-1). If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or break a wall. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe the key is for another purpose.

Wait, maybe the key is part of a rule. The key is an object, so perhaps I can use it to break a wall or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to make some walls passable. The 'stop' rule is at (-2,3). If I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls not stop me.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the layout again. The walls are on the right side, so maybe I can go around them. The key is to the left and down, so maybe I can go there first.

Wait, the key is two left and one down. So from my starting position, I can move left twice and down once to get the key. Then, maybe the key can open a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe the key is for another purpose.

Alternatively, maybe the key is part of a rule. The key is an object, so perhaps I can use it to break a wall or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to make it something else. For example, if I move 'ball' next to 'stop,' making 'ball is stop,' then the ball becomes a stop block, which might block something.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, if I can make 'ball is you,' then the ball becomes me, and I can win by being the ball.

Wait, that's an idea. If I can make 'ball is you,' then the ball becomes me, and since I'm already Baba, which is 'you,' maybe that creates a loop. Or perhaps it allows me to move as the ball.

But how? Let me think. The 'ball' rule is at (4,4). The 'is' rule is at (5,4), and 'you' is at (2,-2). So if I can move 'ball' next to 'is' and 'you,' making 'ball is you,' then the ball becomes me.

But that would require moving 'ball' to (4,4), 'is' to (5,4), and 'you' to (6,4). Wait, no, the 'you' rule is at (2,-2). So maybe I can move 'you' up to be next to 'is' and 'ball.'

Alternatively, maybe I can move 'you' to be next to 'ball' and 'is.' But that's a long way.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' block from (5,4) to be next to 'ball' at (4,4), making 'ball is' something. Then, if I can move 'you' next to that, making 'ball is you.'

But that would require moving 'you' from (2,-2) to (6,4), which is a lot.

Hmm, maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the key again. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to break a wall or unlock a door. But without a door, maybe the key is for another purpose.

Wait, maybe the key is part of a rule. The key is an object, so perhaps I can use it to break a wall or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to make some walls passable. The 'stop' rule is at (-2,3). If I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls not stop me.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the layout again. The walls are on the right side, so maybe I can go around them. The key is to the left and down, so maybe I can go there first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means right now, the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to reach the ball to win, but I might need to change the rules to make it easier.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall to the right and some rules scattered around. There's also a key and another ball near me. Hmm, the key might be useful for opening something, but I'm not sure yet. The other ball is close, but I need to see if I can move it or change the rules to make it work for me.

The rules are laid out in a way that I can move them around. For example, there's a ""ball"" rule, an ""is"" rule, and a ""win"" rule all in a row. If I can move these, I might be able to create a new rule that changes what's considered a win or how I can move.

I notice that there's a ""stop"" rule near some walls. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls stop me or other objects. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

Wait, the key is two steps to the left and one down. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked. Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to change a rule.

The ball is one step to the left and one down. If I can get to it, I can win. But there might be walls blocking me. Let me check the walls. There are walls to the right and some steps up and down. Maybe I can move around them.

I think the best course of action is to move towards the ball. Since I'm Baba, I can move left or right, up or down. Let me try moving left to get closer to the ball. That way, I can reach it and win the level.

So, I'll choose the left action to move towards the ball.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control the baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and four steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" etc., each positioned at different coordinates. There's also a key one step to the left and one step down, a ball one step down, and more walls and rule blocks scattered around.

My goal is to make the ball the win condition, so I need to get the ball to the position where it can be collected or activated. But first, I need to figure out how to move the rule blocks to change the rules or create new ones.

I notice that the ball is currently one step down. If I can move the ball to a position where it's adjacent to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can form a new rule like ""ball is win"" again, but perhaps that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move the ball or change its properties.

Wait, the key is one step to the left and one step down. Maybe I need to pick up the key first to unlock something. But since I'm baba, I can move around. Let me see where the key is. It's at (left 1, down 1). The ball is at (down 1). So if I move left, I can pick up the key. But do I need the key? Maybe it's to unlock a door or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the rule blocks. The ""ball"" rule is five steps to the right and four up, ""is"" is six steps right and four up, ""win"" is seven steps right and four up. If I can move these around, I can create new rules. For example, if I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""ball is win,"" which is already active. But perhaps I need to change it to something else.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left and three up. If I can move that, maybe I can stop certain objects. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the walls. There are walls in various positions, but I can move through them unless they have the ""stop"" property.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the ball winnable. Since the ball is one step down, maybe I can move it to a position where it's adjacent to the ""win"" rule. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball movable. Right now, the ball is just an object. If I can make it ""you,"" then I can control it. But that might not be necessary.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is three steps left and two down. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""baba is you,"" which is already active. But perhaps I can change it to something else.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to reinforce the ""ball is win"" rule. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" to change the win condition.

Wait, the key is at (left 1, down 1). If I move left, I can pick it up. Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or to move certain blocks. But I'm not sure. Let me try moving left to pick up the key.

So, my action would be to move left. That way, I can pick up the key and see if it helps in manipulating the rules or moving other objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and four steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" and others. There's also a key one step down and a ball one step to the right and one step down. 

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and rearrange the rule blocks. The key is nearby, but I'm not sure if I need it yet. The ball is down and to the right, so maybe I can move towards it. 

Wait, the rule ""ball is win"" is already active, so if I can reach the ball, that should win the level. But there are walls blocking the way. Let me check the walls. There are walls at various positions, but maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules. 

I see a ""stop"" rule two steps to the left and three steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. 

Let me think: if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" maybe I can form a new rule like ""ball is win"" again, but that's already active. Or perhaps I can make ""baba is win"" to change the win condition. 

Wait, I'm already ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is win"" if that helps. 

Looking at the key, it's one step down. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But I'm not sure. The ball is one step to the right and down, so maybe I can move right and down to reach it. 

But there are walls in the way. Let me see: the walls are at 3 steps right and various up positions. So if I move right three times, I might hit a wall. But maybe I can move up first to avoid them. 

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. So if I move up, I might be able to go around. Let me try moving up first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop me, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule to change what walls do. 

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps left and three up. If I can move that, maybe I can make walls stop or not. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's helpful. 

Wait, the key is one step down. If I can reach it, maybe it can help me unlock something else. But I'm not sure. 

Let me try to plan my movements. I'm currently at the starting position. The ball is one step right and down. So if I move right and then down, I might reach it. But are there walls blocking that path? 

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 3 right and 1 down. So if I move right three times, I'll hit a wall. But maybe I can move up first to go around. 

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. So if I move up, I can go around the walls. Let me try moving up first. 

So, I'll move up once. Now I'm one step up. Then I can move right three times to get past the walls. But wait, the walls are at 3 right and various up positions. So if I'm one step up, moving right three times would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is a wall. So that's blocked. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move up more. Let me move up twice. Now I'm two steps up. Moving right three times would take me to 3 right and 2 up, which is another wall. Still blocked. 

If I move up three times, I'm at 3 up. Moving right three times would take me to 3 right and 3 up, which is a wall. Still blocked. 

Wait, maybe I can move up four times. Then I'm at 4 up. Moving right three times would take me to 3 right and 4 up, which is a wall. Still blocked. 

So moving right three times from any up position is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to access other areas. But I don't see any objects to the left except for some rule blocks. 

Wait, the key is one step down. Maybe I can move down first. Let me try moving down once. Now I'm one step down. The ball is one step to the right and one step down from here. So if I move right once, I can reach the ball. 

But wait, is there a wall blocking that path? Let me check. The walls are at 3 right and 1 down, which is where I would be after moving right once from my current position. So moving right once would take me to 1 right and 1 down, which is a wall. So I can't move right from there. 

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I need to find another way to reach the ball. 

Wait, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the exit or something. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is win"" and then pick up the key. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

Let me think about the rule blocks. There's a ""ball"" rule six steps to the right and four up, ""is"" seven steps right and four up, ""win"" eight steps right and four up, ""wall"" two left and three up, ""stop"" three up, and others. 

If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can form ""ball is win,"" which is already active. But maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" 

The ""baba"" rule is two left and two down. So if I can move it to the right, I can place it next to ""is"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure how to do that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step left. If I can move it to the right, I can connect it with ""baba"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball and see if I can find a way through. 

So, I'll try moving down once to get closer to the ball. Then, I'll move right once, but that's blocked by a wall. Hmm. 

Maybe I can move up first to go around. Let me try moving up once, then right once, but that's also blocked. 

Wait, maybe I can move left to access other rule blocks. Let me try moving left once. Now I'm one step left. There's a ""stop"" rule three up. Maybe I can move it to change the rules. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change what walls do. The ""wall"" rule is two left and three up. If I can move it, maybe I can make walls stop or not. 

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I should focus on reaching the ball first. 

Wait, the ball is one step right and one step down. If I can move right and then down, but that's blocked by a wall. Maybe I can move down first, then right. 

Let me try moving down once, then right once. But that's blocked by a wall. Hmm. 

Maybe I need to find another way. Let me check the other objects. There's a key one step down. Maybe I can pick it up and use it to unlock something. 

But I'm not sure how. Maybe the key is needed to open a door or something else. 

Wait, the key is one step down. If I can reach it, maybe I can use it to change the rules. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then, picking up the key would win the level. 

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

This is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the rule blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the exit. 

The ""baba"" rule is two left and two down. If I can move it to the right, I can place it next to ""is"" and ""win."" 

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule to connect them. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step left. If I can move it to the right, I can connect it with ""baba"" and ""win."" 

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the right by pushing it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the left to connect with ""baba."" 

But I'm not sure. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. 

Let me try moving right once. That's blocked by a wall. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I can move up first to go around. Let me try moving up once, then right once. Still blocked. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move the walls somehow. But I can't move walls unless they're defined as ""stop."" 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three up. If I can move it next to a wall, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change what walls do. The ""wall"" rule is two left and three up. If I can move it, maybe I can make walls stop or not. 

But I'm not sure how. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. 

So, I'll move down once to reach the key. Then, I can pick it up. But I'm not sure if that helps.

I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball again. 

So, I'll move down once, then right once. But that's blocked by a wall. Hmm.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and four steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" and others. There's also a key one step down and a ball one step to the right and one step down. 

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around to rearrange the rule blocks. The key is nearby, but I'm not sure if I need it yet. 

Wait, the ball is down and to the right. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create a new rule. If I can make ""ball is win,"" that might help. But I already have that as an active rule. Maybe I need to change something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move the ""you"" rule to make myself into the ball. If I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I can become the ball and reach the win condition. Let me check where the ""you"" rule is. It's two steps down. 

I think I should move towards the ""you"" rule to change it. If I can move the ""you"" block next to ""ball,"" I can create ""baba is ball."" That way, I can turn into the ball and reach the win. 

So, I need to move left twice to get to the ""you"" rule. Once there, I can push it next to ""ball."" Then, the rule becomes ""baba is ball,"" and I can transform. Once I'm the ball, I can move to the win condition. 

Let me plan the steps. First, move left twice to reach the ""you"" rule. Then, move it next to ""ball."" After that, I should be able to move as the ball. 

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. The key is one step down, and the ball is one step right and down. The ""you"" rule is two steps down. So, I need to move down twice to reach ""you."" 

Once I have ""you"" next to ""ball,"" the rule changes. Then, I can move as the ball. The win condition is probably the ball, so I need to get the ball to the win spot. 

I think the key might be a distraction. Maybe I don't need it right now. Focus on changing the rules first. 

So, the plan is: move down twice to get the ""you"" rule, then move it next to ""ball"" to make ""baba is ball."" Then, I can move as the ball to win. 

Let me try that. First, move down twice. Then, move right to place ""you"" next to ""ball."" That should do it. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the ""you"" rule is two steps down. So, I need to move down twice. Let me confirm the positions. 

Yes, moving down twice will get me to the ""you"" rule. Then, moving right will place it next to ""ball."" 

Alright, I think that's the way to go. So, the first action is to move down twice. But since each action is one step, I need to output ""down"" twice. But the system only takes one action at a time. So, I'll start with ""down.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and five steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is six steps right and five up, ""is"" is seven right and five up, ""win"" is eight right and five up. There's also a ""wall"" rule two left and four up, and a ""stop"" rule four up. 

There are several walls placed at different positions, and a ball one step to the right. The key is somewhere, but I don't see it in the current observation. Wait, no, the key isn't mentioned here. Maybe it's not relevant right now. 

I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since ""ball is win"" is already active, maybe I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But how? 

I'm Baba, so I can move around. The ball is one step to the right. If I can move the ball to the win position, that might solve it. But can I move the ball? The rules don't say it's stop, so maybe I can push it. 

Wait, the ball is at (1 right, 0 up). The win rule is at (8 right, 5 up). That's pretty far. Maybe I need to create a new rule to make the ball moveable or change the win condition. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules. If I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""ball is you"" or something else. But I'm not sure. 

Let me think about the positions. The ""ball"" rule is at (6 right, 5 up), ""is"" at (7 right, 5 up), and ""win"" at (8 right, 5 up). If I move the ""ball"" rule to the left, I can make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. That might help me move it to the win position. 

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule two steps left to be next to ""is."" But how do I move rule blocks? I can only move them if they're not stopped. Are they stop? The ""stop"" rule is at (0 right, 4 up), so maybe the rule blocks aren't stopped. 

So, I can move the ""ball"" rule two steps left. That would place it at (4 right, 5 up), next to ""is"" at (5 right, 5 up). Then, the rule would be ""ball is..."" but I need to make it ""ball is you."" Wait, the ""you"" rule is at (0 right, 1 down). Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to connect with ""ball is."" 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to the right to connect with ""ball is."" But that might be complicated. 

Another approach: if I can make the ball win by moving it to where the win condition is, but that's too far. Maybe I can change the win condition to be where the ball is. 

If I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is, then the ball would be the win condition. But the ball is at (1 right, 0 up), and the ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 5 up). That's a long way. 

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule. If I move the ""is"" rule between ""ball"" and ""win,"" it would make ""ball is win,"" which is already active. Maybe that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can just move Baba to the win position. But how? 

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (2 left, 1 down), ""is"" at (1 left, 1 down), and ""you"" at (0 right, 1 down). If I can move the ""you"" rule to the right, I can make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. 

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the ball's position. It's at (1 right, 0 up). If I can move the ball to the win position, which is at (8 right, 5 up), that would solve it. But how do I move the ball? 

Since ""ball is win"" is active, maybe I can push the ball. But I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me try moving right to get next to the ball. 

Wait, I'm at (0 right, 0 up). The ball is at (1 right, 0 up). So if I move right, I'll be at (1 right, 0 up), same as the ball. But can I push it? I'm not sure if the ball is movable. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make the ball pushable. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. 

Wait, maybe I can use the existing rules. If I can move the ""ball"" rule to the left, I can make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. Then I can move the ball to the win position. 

So, to do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule two steps left. That would place it at (4 right, 5 up). Then, the ""is"" rule is at (5 right, 5 up), and ""win"" at (6 right, 5 up). Wait, no, that's not right. 

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at (6 right, 5 up). If I move it two steps left, it would be at (4 right, 5 up). Then, the ""is"" rule is at (5 right, 5 up), and ""win"" at (6 right, 5 up). So, the ""ball"" rule is now at (4 right, 5 up), ""is"" at (5 right, 5 up), and ""win"" at (6 right, 5 up). That would make the rule ""ball is win,"" which is already active. 

Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Maybe I need to move the ""you"" rule to the right to connect with ""ball is."" 

The ""you"" rule is at (0 right, 1 down). If I can move it up to (0 right, 5 up), then I can make ""ball is you."" But that's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to connect with ""baba."" 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 5 up). If I move it down to (7 right, 1 down), it would be next to ""baba"" at (2 left, 1 down). But that's a long move. 

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball directly. Let me try moving right to get next to the ball. 

So, I'm at (0 right, 0 up). If I move right, I'll be at (1 right, 0 up), same as the ball. Maybe I can push it. 

But I'm not sure if the ball is movable. Let me check the rules. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" There's no ""ball is stop,"" so maybe it's movable. 

So, I'll try moving right to push the ball. 

Wait, but in the game, you can only push objects if they are adjacent. So, if I'm next to the ball, I can push it. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), then push the ball further right. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try creating a new rule first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is. The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 5 up). If I can move it to (1 right, 0 up), then the ball would be the win condition. 

But moving the ""win"" rule that far seems complicated. 

Wait, maybe I can break the existing rules. If I move the ""is"" rule away from ""ball"" and ""win,"" I can create a new rule. 

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can make ""ball is [something else]."" 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the left to make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. 

So, I'll try moving the ""ball"" rule two steps left. 

But how do I move rule blocks? I think I can move them by being adjacent and then moving into them. 

So, I need to get next to the ""ball"" rule at (6 right, 5 up). 

But I'm at (0 right, 0 up). That's a long way. Maybe I should move up first. 

Wait, the walls are in the way. Let me see the walls. There are walls at (3 right, 5 up), (3 right, 4 up), (3 right, 3 up), (3 right, 2 up), (3 right, 1 up), (3 right, 0 up), and (3 right, 1 down). 

So, the path to the ""ball"" rule is blocked by walls. I can't get to it directly. 

Hmm, maybe I need to find another way. 

Wait, the key is at (1 step down). Maybe I can get the key to unlock something. 

But I don't see a lock in the current observation. Maybe the key isn't needed here. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to move a wall. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (0 right, 4 up). If I can move that, maybe I can make walls movable. 

But I'm not sure. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball first. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), next to the ball. Then, I'll push the ball right to (2 right, 0 up). 

But I'm not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball up. But there's a wall at (3 right, 1 up). 

Wait, the ball is at (1 right, 0 up). If I can move it up, it would go to (1 right, 1 up), but there's a wall at (3 right, 1 up). No, that's not directly above. 

Wait, the walls are at (3 right, 1 up), so the ball can move up to (1 right, 1 up) without a problem. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), then up to (1 right, 1 up), pushing the ball up to (1 right, 1 up). 

But I'm not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball to the win position by creating a new rule. 

Wait, the win position is at (8 right, 5 up). That's too far. 

Maybe I can make the ball win by moving it to where the win rule is. 

But that's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the win condition where the ball is. 

So, if I can move the ""win"" rule to (1 right, 0 up), then the ball would be the win condition. 

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's at (8 right, 5 up). 

I can't get there because of the walls. 

Hmm, maybe I need to break the walls. But I don't see a way to do that. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (0 right, 4 up). If I can move that, maybe I can make walls movable. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls stop. 

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at (2 left, 4 up). If I move it to the right, I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But that's already the case. 

Wait, no, the ""stop"" rule is separate. 

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball step by step. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), then push the ball right to (2 right, 0 up). 

But I'm not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball up. 

So, I'll move up to (0 right, 1 up), but there's a wall at (3 right, 1 up). Wait, no, I'm at (0 right, 0 up). Moving up would take me to (0 right, 1 up), which is clear. 

Then, I can move right to (1 right, 1 up), pushing the ball up to (1 right, 1 up). 

But I'm not sure if that helps. 

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. 

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (2 left, 1 down). If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can just move Baba to the win position. 

So, how do I make ""baba is win""? 

I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba is."" 

The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 5 up). The ""baba"" rule is at (2 left, 1 down). That's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" 

The ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 5 up). If I can move it down to (2 left, 1 down), it would be next to ""baba"" and ""you."" 

But that's a long move. 

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule to make ""ball is you."" 

So, I'll try moving the ""ball"" rule two steps left to (4 right, 5 up). Then, the ""is"" rule is at (5 right, 5 up), and ""win"" at (6 right, 5 up). 

Wait, that would make ""ball is win,"" which is already active. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""you"" rule to the right. 

The ""you"" rule is at (0 right, 1 down). If I can move it to (5 right, 5 up), it would make ""ball is you."" 

But that's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to (0 right, 5 up), then move the ""is"" rule to the right to connect. 

But I'm not sure. 

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball step by step towards the win position. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), then push the ball right to (2 right, 0 up). 

Then, I'll move up to (2 right, 1 up), pushing the ball up to (2 right, 1 up). 

But there's a wall at (3 right, 1 up), so I can't go further right. 

Hmm, maybe I can move the ball up to (2 right, 1 up), then left to (1 right, 1 up), and then up further. 

But I'm not sure. 

I think I need to find a way to create a new rule to make the ball win. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the left. 

The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 5 up). If I can move it to (1 right, 0 up), where the ball is, then the ball would be the win condition. 

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's too far. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the right to make ""ball is win"" again. 

Wait, that's already active. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball to the right as much as possible. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), push the ball to (2 right, 0 up). 

Then, move up to (2 right, 1 up), push the ball up to (2 right, 1 up). 

But there's a wall at (3 right, 1 up), so I can't go further right. 

Hmm, maybe I can move the ball up to (2 right, 1 up), then left to (1 right, 1 up), and then up to (1 right, 2 up). 

But I'm not sure if that helps. 

I think I need to find a way to create a new rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""you."" 

So, I'll try moving the ""is"" rule from (7 right, 5 up) to (5 right, 5 up), making ""ball is you."" 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it. 

I'm at (0 right, 0 up). The ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 5 up). That's too far. 

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball to the right as much as possible and see if that helps. 

So, I'll move right to (1 right, 0 up), push the ball to (2 right, 0 up). 

Then, move up to (2 right, 1 up), push the ball up to (2 right, 1 up). 

But I can't go further right because of the wall. 

I think I need to find another approach. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down. 

The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 5 up). If I can move it down to (8 right, 0 up), then the ball can reach it. 

But that's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the right to make ""ball is win"" again. 

Wait, that's already active. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball to the right and up as much as possible.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and five steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is six steps right and five up, ""is"" is seven right and five up, ""win"" is eight right and five up. There's also a ""wall"" rule two left and four up, and a ""stop"" rule four up. 

There are several walls at different positions: three right and four up, three right and three up, three right and two up, and so on. There's an ""is"" rule one left and one up, and another ""is"" rule one left and one down. The ""baba"" rule is two left and one down, and ""you"" is one down. 

The ball is one step to the right. There's also a key one step down, but I don't see it mentioned in the active rules, so maybe it's not relevant right now. 

My goal is to make the ball the win condition, so I need to get the ball to the win block. But the ball is currently one step to the right. I'm Baba, so I can move around. 

I think I need to move the ball to the win block. But how? The ball is an object, so I can push it if I'm adjacent. Let me see where the ball is. It's one step to the right. So if I move right, I can get next to it. 

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can move freely unless there's a stop rule. Are there any stop rules affecting me? The ""stop"" rule is four steps up, which might be a wall or something else. I'm not sure if that's blocking me. 

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ball, push it towards the win block. The win block is eight steps to the right and five up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule to make the ball moveable or change the win condition. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is, then the ball would be the win condition, and I can just step on it. But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to have the ""is"" rule adjacent to it. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is eight right and five up. The ""is"" rule is seven right and five up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""something is win."" But I'm not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing rules. If I move the ""ball"" rule away from ""is"" and ""win,"" the active rules might change. But that might not help either. 

Let me think differently. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The ball is one step to the right. If I move right, I can be next to the ball. Then, I can push the ball towards the win block. But the win block is far away. Maybe I can create a shortcut by changing the rules. 

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule four steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can remove a wall or something. But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: if I can make the ball into a different object, like a key or something that can open a path. But I don't see a key in the active rules. 

Hmm, maybe I should just try moving towards the ball. Let's see. I'm currently at the starting position. The ball is one step to the right. So I can move right to be next to it. Then, I can push it right or up. 

But the win block is eight right and five up. That's a long way. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball win when it's in a certain position. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is eight right and five up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create a new rule like ""something is win."" But I'm not sure what that would do. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already the active rule. 

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball step by step towards the win block. Let's try moving right to get next to the ball.
