Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means right now, the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key that's 4 steps up. So if I can move up four times, I should reach it. But wait, there are walls in the way. Let me check where the walls are. There's a wall two steps to the right and four steps up. Hmm, that's right where the key is. So the key is behind a wall. I can't just walk up because the wall is blocking me.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a rule 'key' five steps to the right and four up, 'is' six steps right and four up, 'win' seven steps right and four up. Then there's a rule 'wall' three steps left and three up, and 'stop' one step left and three up. Oh, and more walls at various positions. There's also a rule 'ball' seven steps right and a ball one step down, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Wait, the walls are blocking my path. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. Since the current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", I can move the rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones.

Let me think about how to make the walls stop being a barrier. If I can change the rule so that walls are not stop, then I can walk through them. Right now, the rule 'stop' is one step left and three up. If I can move that 'stop' rule to apply to something else or remove it from walls, that would help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls into something else. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is you"", then I could control the walls, but that might not help me pass through them. Or maybe ""wall is win"", but that's not useful here.

Wait, another approach: if I can make the walls into something that's not a barrier. Maybe ""wall is not stop"". But how do I do that? I need to move the rule blocks to form a new rule.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see a 'wall' rule three steps left and three up, and a 'stop' rule one step left and three up. If I can move the 'stop' rule away from the wall, then the walls won't be stop anymore. So I need to move the 'stop' rule block somewhere else.

But how do I move it? I can only move objects that aren't defined as stop. Since the current rule is ""baba is you"", I can move Baba, which is me. So I can move around, but I can't move through walls because they are stop.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule block by moving the 'is' or 'wall' blocks. Let me see. The 'stop' rule is at one step left and three up. If I can move that 'stop' block to a different position, perhaps I can change the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the 'is' and 'stop' blocks next to a wall. For example, if I can place 'is' and 'stop' next to a wall, it would make ""wall is stop"", but that's already the case. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing rule. If I can separate the 'wall' and 'stop' rule blocks, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, and walls wouldn't be stop anymore. So I need to move either the 'wall' or 'stop' block away from each other.

Looking at the positions, the 'wall' rule is three steps left and three up, and the 'stop' rule is one step left and three up. So they are two steps apart on the same row. If I can move the 'stop' block to a different location, maybe I can break the rule.

But how do I move the 'stop' block? I can only move it if it's not defined as stop. Wait, the 'stop' rule is part of the rule ""wall is stop"", so the 'stop' block itself is a rule block, not an object. So maybe I can move it by pushing it with Baba.

Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as stop. So if the 'stop' rule is part of a rule that makes walls stop, then the 'stop' block itself is just a text block and can be moved. So I can move the 'stop' rule block to a different location, which would change the rule.

So my plan is: move the 'stop' rule block away from the 'wall' rule block so that the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer active. That way, walls won't block me anymore, and I can walk through them to reach the key.

To do that, I need to move the 'stop' block. Let me see where it is. It's one step left and three up from my current position. So if I move left once and up three times, I can reach it. But wait, I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. Let me check the objects again.

Wait, the key is four steps up, and the walls are two steps right and four up. So the key is behind a wall. I need to get past that wall. If I can make the walls not stop, I can walk through.

So first, I need to move the 'stop' rule block. It's at one step left and three up. So from my current position, I can move left once, then up three times to reach it. But wait, moving left once would take me to the left of my starting position. Is there a wall there? Let me check the objects.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall two steps to the right and three up, another at two right and two up, and two right and one up. So to the left, I don't see any walls mentioned, so I can move left safely.

So I'll move left once, then up three times to get to the 'stop' rule block. Once I'm there, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, like far away, so that the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'wall' rule block instead. The 'wall' rule is three steps left and three up. If I move that, the rule ""wall is stop"" would still be in effect unless I break the connection between 'wall' and 'stop'.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to create a new rule that overrides the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", but I'm not sure how to do that with the given blocks.

Alternatively, I can move the 'stop' rule block next to a different subject, like 'ball' or 'key', to change their properties. But I think the simplest way is to break the existing rule by moving either 'wall' or 'stop' away.

So, to proceed, I'll move left once to get to the position where the 'stop' rule block is. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like further left or down, so that the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer active.

Wait, but moving the 'stop' block would require me to be adjacent to it, right? So I need to navigate to its position. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move left once to reach the 'stop' rule block's position.
2. Then, move up three times to get to it. Wait, no, the 'stop' block is one step left and three up from my starting position. So from my current position, moving left once and then up three times would get me there.

But wait, moving up three times from the left position might take me into walls. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at two right and various up positions, so moving left and up might not hit any walls. So I can safely move left once, then up three times to reach the 'stop' block.

Once I'm there, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else. Let's say I move it down, so it's no longer connected to the 'wall' rule. That way, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, and walls are no longer stop.

After that, I can move up four times to reach the key, which is now accessible because the walls are not stopping me anymore.

So the first step is to move left once to get to the position where the 'stop' rule block is. Then, I can move up three times to reach it, pick it up, and move it away.

Wait, but in the game, you can only move one block at a time, and you can only move in one direction per action. So I need to plan each move carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' block to create a new rule. For example, if I can place 'is' between 'wall' and 'stop', but that's already the case. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the 'is' block next to another subject. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", but that would make me stop, which is bad. Or ""key is stop"", which would make the key unpassable, but I need the key to be win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""stop is not stop"", but I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to move the 'stop' rule block to a different location, so that the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer active. That way, walls are no longer stop, and I can walk through them.

So, to do that, I need to move the 'stop' block. Let me see where it is: one step left and three up. So from my starting position, I can move left once, then up three times to reach it.

But wait, moving up three times from the left position might take me into walls. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at two right and various up positions, so moving left and up should be clear.

So, first, I'll move left once to get to the 'stop' block's column. Then, I'll move up three times to reach it. Once there, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, like down or further left, so that it's no longer connected to the 'wall' rule.

Once the 'stop' block is moved, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, and walls are no longer stop. Then, I can move up four times to reach the key, which is now accessible.

So, the first action I need to take is to move left once to get to the 'stop' block's position. That way, I can start moving it away.

Wait, but in the game, you can only move one step at a time. So I need to choose the first action, which is moving left once. That would get me closer to the 'stop' block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the key, but the walls are blocking that path. So moving left to access the 'stop' block seems necessary.

So, the first action I should take is to move left once, which would allow me to start moving towards the 'stop' rule block and change the rules to make walls passable.
</think>

To solve the puzzle, I need to make the walls passable by moving the 'stop' rule block away from the 'wall' rule block. The first step is to move left once to reach the 'stop' block's position.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. There are walls around it, so I might need to move some text blocks to change the rules or clear a path.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a rule `key` at 6 steps right and 4 up, `is` at 7 right and 4 up, and `win` at 8 right and 4 up. Also, there's a `wall` rule at 2 left and 3 up, and a `stop` rule at 3 up. There are also `ball`, `baba`, `is`, and `you` rules in different positions.

Since I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar, I need to see which rules I can manipulate. The `stop` rule is at 3 up, so maybe I can move it to block something or change a rule.

I think the key is to change the rules so that I can either make the walls passable or redefine what ""win"" means. If I can make the walls not stop me, I can move through them. Alternatively, I could change the win condition to something else if that helps.

Looking at the walls, they are positioned in a way that might be blocking my path to the key. If I can move the `wall` rule, maybe I can make the walls not act as walls anymore. For example, if I move the `wall` rule to say ""wall is not stop,"" that might make the walls passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the `key` rule to change what counts as the win condition. But since the current rule is ""key is win,"" maybe I can redefine ""key"" to be something else or change the win condition.

Wait, another idea: if I can move the `is` rule, I might be able to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass through,"" but I don't see a ""pass through"" rule here. Hmm.

Let me think about the positions. The `stop` rule is at 3 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. So, if I move the `stop` rule to a different position, perhaps I can redefine it. Or maybe I can move the `wall` rule to combine with another word to change its property.

Wait, the `wall` rule is at 2 left and 3 up. If I can move it to combine with `is` and another word, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop."" That would make the walls passable.

So, to do that, I need to move the `wall` rule to a position where it can form a new rule. Let me see where the `is` rules are. There's an `is` rule at 7 right and 4 up, and another at 1 left. Maybe I can move the `wall` rule next to an `is` and a ""not stop"" or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `stop` rule to combine with `wall` to make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is not stop."" But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, another approach: if I can move the `key` rule to a different position, maybe I can change the win condition. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach myself, which is always true, but that might not help. Or maybe make ""ball is win"" if there's a ball nearby.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I just need to reach the ball. But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` rule to change the win condition. The `win` rule is at 8 right and 4 up. If I can move it to combine with another word, maybe I can redefine it.

Wait, perhaps the simplest way is to move the `stop` rule so that the walls don't stop me. If I can move the `stop` rule to a position where it's not associated with walls, then the walls won't block me anymore.

So, how can I move the `stop` rule? It's currently at 3 up. If I move it to a different location, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. But I'm not sure how the rules are formed. Each rule is a triplet of subject, is, property. So, if I can move the `stop` rule to a different position, maybe I can make a new rule that overrides the old one.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `wall` rule to a position where it's not combined with `is` and `stop`. For example, if I move the `wall` rule to a spot where it's next to `is` and something else, like `pass`, but I don't see a `pass` rule here.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the `wall` rule next to an `is` and a `not stop` or something. But I don't see a `not` rule. Hmm.

Another idea: if I can move the `key` rule to a different position, maybe I can make the key not be the win condition anymore. But that might not help me win.

Wait, maybe I can move the `you` rule. The `you` rule is at 2 steps down. If I can move it to combine with `is` and something else, maybe I can change what I am. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass through,"" but I don't see a `pass through` rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" which would mean I am the key, so I win by being myself. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, let me think about the positions again. The key is at 1 right and 4 up. There are walls around it. So, to get to the key, I need to move up 4 steps and right 1. But walls are blocking the way.

If I can make the walls passable, I can move through them. So, how can I do that? Maybe by changing the rule so that walls are not stop.

So, I need to move the `wall` rule to a position where it can form a new rule. Let's see, the `wall` rule is at 2 left and 3 up. If I can move it to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `not stop` or something, but I don't see a `not` rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the `stop` rule to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move the `stop` rule away, then the walls won't stop me anymore.

So, how can I move the `stop` rule? It's at 3 up. If I can move it to a different spot, maybe to the right or left, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` rule that's associated with `wall` and `stop` to a different position, breaking that rule.

Wait, perhaps I can move the `is` rule that's at 7 right and 4 up. If I move it, maybe I can break the ""key is win"" rule or create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `key` rule to a different position, changing the win condition.

Wait, another approach: if I can move the `baba` rule, which is at 2 left and 2 down, to a position where it can form a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass through,"" but I don't see a `pass through` rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so I become the key and win.

Wait, let me think about the rules again. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, I'm Baba, and the key is the win condition.

If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key, so I would win immediately. But how can I do that?

I need to move the `baba` rule to a position where it can form ""baba is key."" The `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down. The `is` rule is at 7 right and 4 up, and another at 1 left. The `key` rule is at 6 right and 4 up.

So, if I can move the `baba` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `key` rule, then I can form ""baba is key.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `key` rule next to an `is` and a `baba` rule.

Wait, but moving rules requires moving the text blocks. So, I need to move the `baba` rule to a spot where it's adjacent to an `is` and a `key` rule.

Looking at the positions, the `is` rule is at 7 right and 4 up, and the `key` rule is at 6 right and 4 up. So, if I can move the `baba` rule to 5 right and 4 up, then it would be next to `is` at 7 right and `key` at 6 right. Wait, no, that might not form the rule correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` rule to be between `baba` and `key`. But that might be complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to move the `key` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `baba` rule, forming ""key is baba,"" which would mean the key is me, so I win.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `you` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `key` rule, making ""you is key,"" which would mean I (as Baba) am the key, so I win.

The `you` rule is at 2 steps down. If I can move it to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `key` rule, that could work.

But I'm not sure about the exact positions. Let me try to visualize the map.

The key is at 1 right and 4 up. The walls are around it. The `key` rule is at 6 right and 4 up. The `is` rule is at 7 right and 4 up. The `win` rule is at 8 right and 4 up.

So, if I can move the `you` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `key` rule, maybe I can form ""you is key.""

But the `you` rule is at 2 down. To get it to 7 right and 4 up, I would need to move it a lot, which might not be possible due to walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` rule to a different position. For example, moving the `is` rule at 7 right and 4 up to a spot where it's between `baba` and `key`.

Wait, the `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down. That's far from the `is` and `key` rules. So, moving it might be difficult.

Another idea: if I can move the `stop` rule to a different position, maybe I can make the walls passable. The `stop` rule is at 3 up. If I move it to a spot where it's not associated with walls, then the walls won't stop me.

So, how can I move the `stop` rule? It's at 3 up. If I can move it to the right or left, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, but moving the `stop` rule might not be enough. I need to make sure that the walls are no longer defined as stop.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `wall` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `not stop` rule, but I don't see a `not` rule.

Wait, perhaps I can move the `wall` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `pass` rule, but I don't see a `pass` rule either.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the objects again.

There's a ball at 1 right and 1 down. The `ball` rule is at 8 right. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. If I can make the ball the win condition, then I just need to reach it.

So, if I can move the `win` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `ball` rule, making ""ball is win,"" then I can win by reaching the ball.

The `win` rule is at 8 right and 4 up. The `is` rule is at 7 right and 4 up. The `ball` rule is at 8 right. So, if I can move the `win` rule to a position where it's next to `is` and `ball`, that could work.

Wait, but the `win` rule is already at 8 right and 4 up, and the `is` is at 7 right and 4 up. So, if I can move the `ball` rule to 6 right and 4 up, then the `is` would be between `ball` and `win`, forming ""ball is win.""

But the `ball` rule is at 8 right. To move it to 6 right, I would need to move it left by 2 steps. But is that possible? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` rule to a different position. For example, moving the `is` rule at 7 right and 4 up to a spot where it's between `ball` and `win`.

Wait, the `ball` rule is at 8 right, and the `win` rule is at 8 right and 4 up. So, if I can move the `is` rule to 8 right and 3 up, then it would be between `ball` (8 right) and `win` (8 right and 4 up), forming ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `ball` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `win` rule. For example, moving the `ball` rule to 7 right and 4 up, where the `is` rule is, and then the `win` rule is at 8 right and 4 up. So, that would form ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible due to walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the `ball` rule up to 4 up, next to the `is` and `win` rules. That way, ""ball is win"" would be formed.

But I'm not sure how to move the `ball` rule. It's at 8 right. To move it up, I would need to move it to 8 right and 1 up, but there might be walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `ball` rule. The `win` rule is at 8 right and 4 up. The `is` rule is at 7 right and 4 up. The `ball` rule is at 8 right. So, if I can move the `win` rule to 8 right and 3 up, then it would be next to the `ball` rule at 8 right and the `is` rule at 7 right and 4 up. Wait, that might not form the rule correctly.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the initial rules again.

The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, I need to reach the key to win. The key is at 1 right and 4 up, but walls are blocking the way.

If I can make the walls passable, I can move through them. So, how can I change the rule so that walls are not stop.

The `wall` rule is at 2 left and 3 up. The `is` rule is at 7 right and 4 up, and another at 1 left. The `stop` rule is at 3 up.

So, if I can move the `wall` rule to a position where it's next to an `is` and a `not stop` rule, but I don't see a `not` rule. Alternatively, maybe I can move the `stop` rule to a different position, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, if I can move the `stop` rule to a spot where it's not associated with walls, then the walls won't stop me anymore. So, how can I move the `stop` rule?

The `stop` rule is at 3 up. If I can move it to the right or left, maybe I can break the association with walls.

But to move the `stop` rule, I need to move it as a text block. So, I can move it up, down, left, or right, but I can't move through walls unless I change the rules.

Wait, but right now, walls are stop, so I can't move through them. So, I can't reach the `stop` rule if it's behind walls.

Wait, looking at the objects, the `stop` rule is at 3 up. Are there walls blocking me from moving up 3 steps? Let me check.

The walls are at various positions, but I'm not sure if they block the path to the `stop` rule. Maybe I can move up to reach it.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me see: the key is 1 right and 4 up. The walls are around it, but maybe I can move up 3 steps to reach the `stop` rule.

If I can move up 3 steps, I can reach the `stop` rule and move it elsewhere. But are there walls blocking me?

Looking at the walls, there are walls at 3 right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. So, maybe the path to the `stop` rule is clear.","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. There are also several walls around, which probably block my path. The rules are laid out as text blocks that I can move to change the game's rules.

I notice that there are rule blocks for ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be rearranged to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make the walls stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the key is the win condition, so I need to reach it. The key is at (1 right, 4 up). Let me visualize the map. There's a wall at (3 right, 4 up), which is right next to the key. So the key is blocked by a wall. I can't get to the key directly because of the wall.

I need to find a way to remove or bypass the wall. Maybe I can change the rules so that the wall becomes passable. How? If I can make the wall not stop me, that would help. The current rule is ""wall is stop,"" which makes walls immovable. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make walls passable.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block next to something else, like ""not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving one of the words.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block to a different position, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is you,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule available.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass through,"" but I don't see a ""pass through"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. But the key is already the win condition, so that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the win condition, but that seems less useful.

Let me think about the positions of the rule blocks. The ""key"" rule is at 6 right, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right, 4 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 4 up. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. The ""ball"" rule is at 8 right. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down. The ""you"" rule is at 2 down.

I need to move some of these rule blocks to create a new rule that will help me. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. If I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location, the wall might no longer be stop.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule block next to ""not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule block.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule like ""wall is not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another idea: if I can move the ""baba"" rule block to change what I am. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass through,"" but again, I don't see a ""pass through"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball, which might have different properties. The ball is at 1 right, 1 down. If I can make the ball the win condition, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, but I'm not sure if that helps me reach the key.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. If I can make ""key is not win,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" so I can become the key, but that might not help.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to plan step by step.

1. I need to reach the key at (1 right, 4 up), but it's blocked by a wall at (3 right, 4 up).

2. The wall is stopping me because of the rule ""wall is stop.""

3. To pass through the wall, I need to change the rule so that walls are not stop.

4. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block away from the wall's rule.

5. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. I can move it somewhere else, but I need to see if I can move it.

6. Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule block to a different location to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

7. Let me see where the ""wall"" rule block is. It's at 2 left, 3 up.

8. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block to a different location, perhaps I can create a new rule.

9. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule block next to ""not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule.

10. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule.

11. Wait, the ""is"" rule block is at 7 right, 4 up. If I move it next to ""wall"" and ""something else,"" maybe I can create a new rule.

12. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

13. If I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location, the wall might no longer be stop.

14. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. It's at 3 up. I can move it left or right.

15. Let me see if I can move it to the left. There's a wall at 3 right, 3 up, so moving left might be possible.

16. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule block down, but I need to check if there's space.

17. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it down, it would go to 3 up minus 1, which is 2 up.

18. But I need to see if that's possible without hitting walls.

19. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the right, but there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up, so maybe not.

20. Hmm, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the left, towards the ""wall"" rule block.

21. If I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the left, it would be next to the ""wall"" rule block, but that might not help.

22. Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule block to the right, towards the ""stop"" rule block.

23. Wait, the ""wall"" rule block is at 2 left, 3 up. If I move it to the right, it would go to 3 left, 3 up, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

24. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block down to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

25. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block down, it would no longer be next to ""stop,"" breaking the rule.

26. So, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule block down by one step.

27. Let me check the positions. The ""wall"" rule block is at 2 left, 3 up. Moving it down would take it to 2 left, 2 up.

28. Is that position clear? I think so, as there's no wall there.

29. So, if I move the ""wall"" rule block down, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, and walls would no longer stop me.

30. That would allow me to pass through the wall blocking the key.

31. So, the plan is to move the ""wall"" rule block down, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, then move to the key.

32. But how do I move the ""wall"" rule block? I need to move it as Baba.

33. Wait, Baba is at the starting position. Let me see where the ""wall"" rule block is relative to Baba.

34. The ""wall"" rule block is at 2 left, 3 up. So, from Baba's position, I need to move left twice and up three times to reach it.

35. But there might be walls in the way. Let me check the map again.

36. There are walls at 3 right, 4 up; 3 right, 3 up; 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; 3 right, 2 down.

37. So, moving left from Baba's position, I can go left twice to reach the ""wall"" rule block at 2 left, 3 up.

38. Wait, but moving left from Baba's position, I might hit walls. Let me see.

39. From Baba's starting position, moving left twice would take me to 2 left, but I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

40. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up, but that's to the right, not the left. So, moving left should be possible.

41. So, I can move left twice to reach the ""wall"" rule block at 2 left, 3 up.

42. Once there, I can move the ""wall"" rule block down to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

43. After that, the walls are no longer stop, so I can pass through them.

44. Then, I can move up to reach the key at 1 right, 4 up.

45. So, the steps are:

46. 1. Move left twice to reach the ""wall"" rule block.

47. 2. Move the ""wall"" rule block down once.

48. 3. Move up to pass through the wall and reach the key.

49. But wait, after moving the ""wall"" rule block, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, so walls are passable.

50. So, I can proceed to the key.

51. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block instead.

52. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it down, it would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

53. So, moving the ""stop"" rule block down once would take it to 2 up, breaking the rule.

54. Then, walls are no longer stop, and I can pass through.

55. So, which is easier: moving the ""wall"" rule block or the ""stop"" rule block?

56. The ""stop"" rule block is at 3 up, which is closer to Baba's starting position. So, maybe it's easier to move the ""stop"" rule block.

57. Let me see: from Baba's position, moving up three times would take me to 3 up, where the ""stop"" rule block is.

58. Then, I can move the ""stop"" rule block down once, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

59. That might be a shorter path.

60. So, the steps would be:

61. 1. Move up three times to reach the ""stop"" rule block at 3 up.

62. 2. Move the ""stop"" rule block down once, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

63. 3. Then, move up to the key, passing through the wall.

64. That seems feasible.

65. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the right or left, but moving it down seems straightforward.

66. So, I think moving the ""stop"" rule block down is the way to go.

67. Therefore, the action would be to move up three times, then move the ""stop"" rule block down.

68. But wait, in the game, you can only move one step at a time, and you have to choose one action each time.

69. So, in the current state, I need to choose the first action, which is to move up.

70. So, the first action is to move up.

71. Then, in the next step, I can move up again, and so on, until I reach the ""stop"" rule block.

72. Once there, I can move it down.

73. So, the immediate action is to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. There are also several walls and rule blocks scattered around. The rule blocks are important because I can move them to change the rules of the level.

I notice that the rule blocks for ""key,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" are all in a line to the right and up. Maybe I can move these to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might help me reach the win condition.

But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. I need to figure out how to move the rule blocks. The rule blocks are text blocks, so I can move them if they're not stopped by a ""stop"" rule. I see a ""stop"" rule block 2 steps up. So, I can move other rule blocks as long as they're not blocked by this.

Let me plan my steps. I need to move the ""key"" rule block to combine it with ""baba."" The ""key"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I'm currently at the starting point, so I need to move right and up to reach it. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps to the right and various steps up, so I might need to go around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move it next to ""baba,"" I can make ""baba is key."" That would let me become the key and reach the win condition.

But how do I get there? I need to move up and to the right, but walls are blocking my path. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block to remove a wall. The ""wall"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I move it somewhere else, the walls might become passable.

Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule block, the walls might change their properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but that's already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule block. It's 2 steps up. If I move it next to a wall, that wall would become a stopper, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Let me think differently. The key is 1 step right and 3 up. I need to get there. The walls are in the way, but maybe I can break through them by changing the rules. If I can make ""baba is wall,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""wall"" rule near me.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 steps left and 2 up. If I can move it next to ""baba,"" I can make ""baba is wall."" That would let me pass through walls. But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I need to get to it first.

I'm at the starting point. To reach the ""wall"" rule, I need to move 2 steps left and 2 up. But moving left might not be possible if there are walls in the way. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 up, but I'm starting from the left. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. If I move up, I can get to the ""stop"" rule block, which is 2 steps up. If I move the ""stop"" rule, I can make other objects stoppable or not.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 up. If I can move it next to ""baba,"" I can make ""baba is key."" That would let me become the key and reach the win condition.

But to get to the ""is"" rule, I need to move right and up. There are walls in the way, but maybe I can go around. Let me try moving right first. I move right once, then up three times to reach the ""is"" rule. But there are walls at 3 steps right and various up positions. Maybe I can go up first, then right.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. So if I move up first, I can avoid the walls on the right. Let me try moving up three times to get past the walls, then move right to reach the ""is"" rule.

Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can move it to create ""baba is key."" That would make me the key, and I can then move to the key's position to win.

But I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" rule. Since it's a rule block, I can move it as long as it's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up, so I need to make sure I don't hit that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to make ""key is you,"" but that might not help since I'm already ""baba is you.""

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule block to create ""baba is key."" That way, I can become the key and reach the win condition.

So, my plan is:

1. Move up three times to get past the walls.
2. Move right to reach the ""is"" rule block.
3. Move the ""is"" rule block next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is key.""
4. Then, move to the key's position to win.

But wait, moving up three times might take me to the ""stop"" rule block. I need to avoid that. Maybe I can move up two times instead, then right.

Alternatively, I can move right first, then up. Let me see:

- Move right once: now at 1 right.
- Move up three times: now at 1 right, 3 up. That's where the key is. But the key is the win condition, so if I'm there, I win. But I'm not sure if I can get there because of the walls.

Wait, the key is at 1 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 3 right, 3 up, but I'm at 1 right, so maybe I can get there without hitting the wall.

Wait, no, the walls are at 3 right and various up positions, so 1 right, 3 up might be clear. Let me check the objects:

- key is at 1 right, 3 up.
- wall is at 3 right, 3 up.
- So, the path to the key is clear on the left side.

So, maybe I can just move right once and up three times to reach the key directly. But the active rule is ""key is win,"" so if I reach the key, I win. But I'm ""baba is you,"" so I can move as Baba.

Wait, but the key is at 1 right, 3 up. I'm starting at 0,0. So moving right once and up three times would get me there. But are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So, the walls are all on the right side, at 3 right and various up/down positions. So, moving to 1 right, 3 up should be clear because the walls are at 3 right.

Therefore, maybe I can just move right once and up three times to reach the key and win.

But wait, the initial observation shows that the key is 1 step right and 4 step up. Wait, in the current observation, it's 1 step right and 3 step up. So, I need to move right once and up three times.

But in the previous observation, the key was at 1 right, 4 up, and now it's at 1 right, 3 up. So, perhaps the key moved down one step. That might be because I moved up in the previous step.

Wait, no, the key's position is given relative to the starting point. So, in the current observation, the key is 1 right, 3 up from the starting point.

So, I can move right once, then up three times to reach the key.

But I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the walls are at 3 right, I can move along the left side without hitting any walls.

So, my action should be to move right once, then up three times. But the actions are single steps, so I need to choose one action at a time.

In the previous step, I chose ""up,"" which moved me up one step. Now, in the current observation, I'm at 0 right, 1 up.

So, my next step should be to move up again to reach 0 right, 2 up. Then, up again to 0 right, 3 up. Then, right once to 1 right, 3 up, where the key is.

But wait, in the current observation, the key is at 1 right, 3 up. So, after moving up three times, I can move right once to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first, then up. Let me see:

- Move right once: 1 right, 0 up.
- Then up three times: 1 right, 3 up. That's the key's position.

But I need to check if moving right first is possible. Are there any walls blocking me at 1 right?

Looking at the walls, the closest wall on the right is at 3 right. So, moving to 1 right is clear.

Therefore, moving right once, then up three times should get me to the key.

But since I can only choose one action at a time, I need to decide the next step. In the previous step, I moved up once, so now I'm at 0 right, 1 up.

My next action should be to move up again to 0 right, 2 up. Then, up again to 0 right, 3 up. Then, right once to 1 right, 3 up.

But perhaps a more efficient way is to move right first, then up. Let me try that.

So, the next action would be to move right once. That would take me to 1 right, 0 up. Then, I can move up three times to reach the key.

But I need to make sure that moving right is possible. Since there are no walls at 1 right, I can move there.

So, my next action is to move right once.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 3 steps up. There are walls around it, which might block my path. I also see several rule blocks: ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

I need to figure out how to move the rule blocks to make the key accessible. Since the key is 3 steps up, I should check if there's a way to move the walls or change their properties. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up, and some down. There's also a ""stop"" rule, which probably makes objects immovable if they have that property.

I notice that the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, maybe the walls won't block me anymore. Alternatively, I could try to change the rules so that walls become passable or that I can move through them.

Another idea is to change the win condition. If I can make something else the win condition, maybe I can bypass the key. But since the key is already the win, perhaps it's better to focus on getting to it.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe if I can create a rule involving the ball, I can use it to move the key or the walls. But I'm not sure how that would help immediately.

Let me think about the movement. I'm Baba, so I can move up, down, left, or right. The key is 3 steps up, but there are walls in the way. If I can move the walls or change their properties, I can clear the path.

Looking at the rule blocks, I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I can create ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But that's probably not helpful because I want to move through them.

Wait, maybe I can make the walls not stop. If I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" that would make the walls passable. But I don't see a ""not"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself, but I still need to reach the key to do that.

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on moving the rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass through,"" then I can walk through the walls. But I don't see a ""pass through"" rule, so that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and maybe use it to move the key or the walls. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Let me try to visualize the map. The key is 3 steps up. There are walls to the right and up, so maybe I need to go around them. But the walls are blocking the path. If I can move the walls to the side, I can create a path.

I see that the ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I move the ""wall"" rule to the right, maybe I can change the walls' properties. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls to make them movable.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, the walls might no longer be stopped, meaning I can move through them. So, I should try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule's position, it's 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I move it down or to the right, it might no longer affect the walls. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule down.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move the rule block itself. So, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a new position where it doesn't affect the walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule like ""wall is you,"" which would make the walls moveable since I'm controlling them. But that might not be helpful because I still need to get to the key.

Another approach: since the key is 3 steps up, and the walls are blocking, maybe I can move the key down. If I can move the ""key"" rule block to a new position, I can change the key's location.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Alternatively, I can try to move the key itself, but it's probably fixed unless I change the rules.

Wait, the key is an object, so maybe I can move it if I change its properties. If I make ""key is push,"" I can push it through walls, but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think differently. Since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can go around the walls. The key is 3 steps up, but if I go to the right first, maybe I can find a path.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball 2 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, if I can make the ball into a bomb or something that can destroy walls, but I don't see a rule for that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to jump over walls. But again, I don't see a ""jump"" rule.

Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win,"" which would mean I win when I reach myself, but that doesn't help.

Wait, the current win condition is ""key is win,"" so I need to reach the key. Maybe I can move the key to a different location by changing the rules.

If I move the ""key"" rule block to a new position, I can redefine where the key is. For example, if I move it next to ""you,"" I can make ""key is you,"" which would mean I'm the key, but I still need to reach the key object.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is move,"" allowing me to move the key. But I don't see a ""move"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule to a different location to make the walls passable. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule down.

So, I'll move the ""stop"" rule block down. That should remove the stop property from the walls, making them passable. Once the walls are passable, I can move through them to reach the key.

Wait, but how do I move the ""stop"" rule block? I need to move it using my actions. Since I'm Baba, I can move up, down, left, or right. I should move towards the ""stop"" rule block to pick it up and move it elsewhere.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule's position, it's 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So, I need to move left and up to reach it. Once I have it, I can move it down to a new position where it doesn't affect the walls.

After moving the ""stop"" rule, the walls should no longer be stopped, allowing me to pass through them. Then, I can move up to the key and win the level.

So, my plan is to move towards the ""stop"" rule, pick it up, and move it down. Then, I can go through the walls to reach the key.

Let me try that. I'll move left to reach the ""stop"" rule, then up to pick it up, and then move it down. Once it's moved, the walls should be passable.

Wait, but I'm not sure if moving the ""stop"" rule will affect all walls or just specific ones. I need to make sure that moving it will remove the stop property from all walls.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""pass,"" but I don't have a ""pass"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first and see what happens. If that doesn't work, I'll try another approach.

So, I'll move left to reach the ""stop"" rule. Once I have it, I'll move it down to a new position. Then, I'll check if the walls are passable.

If the walls are now passable, I'll move up through them to reach the key. If not, I'll need to try a different strategy, like moving the ""wall"" rule or creating a new rule.

Alright, let's try moving left to get the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. There are walls around, which probably block my movement. The rules are laid out as text blocks: ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

I need to figure out how to move the key or change the rules so I can reach it. Since the key is 1 right and 3 up, I should check if there's a clear path. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move some walls or change their properties.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is at 2 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make walls passable. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make them immovable, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is wall,"" I could turn into a wall and push other walls, but that might complicate things.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule next to the key object, maybe I can change what counts as the win condition. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach it.

Looking at the ball, it's 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball affect the key or the walls. But I'm not sure how to utilize that yet.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Since I'm Baba, I can move up, right, down, or left. Let me see the path: 1 right and 3 up. Are there walls blocking that path? The walls are at 3 steps right and various up positions, so maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 3 up, 3 right and 2 up, etc. So if I move right once and up three times, I might hit a wall. Maybe I need to move up first to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the safest move is to go up first to see if I can navigate around the walls. So I'll choose the ""up"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. There are walls around, which I assume are obstacles I can't pass through unless I change the rules. There are also several rule blocks scattered around, which I can move to create or modify rules.

I need to figure out how to get to the key. The key is two steps up and one to the right. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is probably blocking the path. Also, there are other walls at various positions, some to the right and some down.

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks to change the rules. So maybe I can move some rule blocks to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. But since the key is already the win condition, maybe I should focus on moving the walls.

Wait, the rule blocks are at different positions. For example, there's a rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is probably the ""key is win"" rule. Similarly, there's a rule `is` and `win` nearby. If I can move these, I might be able to change the rules.

But I'm Baba, so I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP."" I need to check if any of the walls are ""STOP"" or if I can make them not stop. If I can change a wall's property, maybe I can walk through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something like that, I might be able to move through them.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a rule `stop` 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the stop property. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key is win"" rule, maybe I can place it somewhere else, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba is you"" rule to change my properties. If I can make ""baba is pass"" or something, I might be able to walk through walls.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think about the steps. I need to move the rule blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks next to a wall, I can make ""wall is stop"" or change it.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing rules. If I separate ""key is win,"" maybe the key isn't the win condition anymore, but that might not help.

Wait, the key is two steps up and one to the right. Let me see if I can get there without moving through walls. Are there any paths around? The walls are at 3 steps to the right and 2 up, so maybe I can go around them.

But I'm at the starting position, which I assume is the origin. Let me try moving up twice and right once. But if there's a wall there, I can't. So I need to find a way to remove or change the wall.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a rule `wall` 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push them aside.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" they might disappear. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, there's a rule `stop` 1 step up. If I can move that next to a wall, I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that might make them more solid. I don't want that.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another property. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is win,"" then stepping on a wall would win the game, but that's not helpful since the key is the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is pass."" If I can do that, I can walk through walls. How? I need to have ""baba is"" and ""pass"" somewhere. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule block. Maybe I can create it by moving other blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is push."" If I can push walls, I can move them out of the way.

Let me see the rule blocks again. There's a rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that next to a wall and a ""push"" block, I can create ""wall is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" block. Maybe I can create it by moving other blocks.

Wait, there's a rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can use that somehow, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win"" and change it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the wall and then next to ""stop"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but that would make the walls impenetrable, which is the opposite of what I want.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""baba is you"" rule to change my properties. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" I can walk through walls.

To do that, I need to have ""baba is"" and ""pass"" somewhere. But I don't see a ""pass"" block. Maybe I can create it by moving other blocks.

Wait, there's a rule `stop` 1 step up. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""baba,"" I can make ""baba is stop,"" but that would make me stop, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and another property to change my abilities.

Wait, there's a rule `you` 4 steps down. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""baba,"" I can make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. So that doesn't help.

Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me try to move towards the key and see if I can find a way through.

The key is at (1 right, 2 up). There's a wall at (3 right, 2 up). So maybe I can go around the wall. Let me see if there's a path to the right or left.

Looking at the walls, there are walls at 3 steps to the right and various up and down positions. Maybe I can go further to the right and then up.

Wait, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I go to the right past that, maybe I can find a way up.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall blocks to clear the path.

Wait, I can move rule blocks, but I can't move walls unless they're defined as movable. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't ""stop.""

So, if I can change the wall's property to not be ""stop,"" I can move them.

How can I do that? I need to create a rule that says ""wall is not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" block. Alternatively, I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, maybe the walls are already ""stop"" by default. So I need to change that.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then next to ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's the opposite of what I want.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. If I can separate ""wall is stop,"" then the walls won't be stop anymore.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop."" For example, ""wall is push."" If I can do that, I can push the walls aside.

To create ""wall is push,"" I need to have ""wall,"" ""is,"" and ""push"" in a line. But I don't see a ""push"" block. Maybe I can create it by moving other blocks.

Wait, there's a rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can use that to create ""push."" But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""key"" rule. If I can make ""key is push,"" then the key can be pushed, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then see what happens.

Wait, there's a rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that next to a wall, I can create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule closer to the wall at (3 right, 2 up). If I can place ""is"" next to it, I can create ""wall is something.""

But I don't have a ""something"" block. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move that next to the wall and the ""is"" rule, I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to move towards the key and see if I can find a way through.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. There are walls around, which probably block my movement. The rules are laid out as text blocks that I can move to change the game's rules.

I need to figure out how to get to the key. The key is two steps up and one to the right. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the properties of the walls or the key.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. Or perhaps I can change the ""key is win"" rule to something else to make the key easier to reach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba is you"" rule to change what I am. If I can make myself into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to move through walls or something.

Let me check the positions again. The key is at (1 right, 2 up). The walls are around it, so I need to find a path or a way to remove the walls. The rule blocks are spread out, so maybe I can move them to create new rules.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being solid. If I can make the walls stop, then I can walk through them. Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule to change what the key does.

Wait, if I move the ""key"" rule to be ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, which might not help. Or if I make ""key is push,"" maybe I can push it. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" but that might not help. Or maybe ""wall is push"" so I can push the walls out of the way.

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first. If I move the ""stop"" rule to be next to a wall, maybe that wall becomes stop, which could block movement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is currently at 1 step up. If I move it to be next to a wall, maybe that wall becomes a stop block, which I can't move through. That might not help.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to change the properties of walls. For example, making ""wall is push"" so I can push them.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""push"" to make ""wall is push.""

But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule between two other words. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, which might not help. Or ""key is win"" is already the case.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""baba"" rule to change what I am. If I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I can bounce around and maybe reach the key.

But I don't see a ""ball"" rule here. Wait, there is a ""ball"" rule 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule.

If I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""ball is you,"" which would make me a ball. Then I could bounce over the walls to reach the key.

That sounds promising. So I need to move the ""ball"" rule to create ""ball is you."" How can I do that?

First, I need to move the ""ball"" rule closer. It's currently 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. I'm at the starting position, so I need to move right 8 times and down 2 times to get there. But that's a long way, and there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move other rule blocks to create a path. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule to make some walls passable.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it stop, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, moving the ""wall"" rule to change the walls' properties.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""key is push,"" then I can push the key, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think the best approach is to try to make myself a ball so I can move through walls. To do that, I need to create the rule ""ball is you."" So I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you.""

The ""ball"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. I'm at the starting position, so I need to move right 8 times and down 2 times. But that's a long path, and I don't know if it's blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""ball"" rule's location to create the new rule. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving through walls.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule first. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move it closer, I can create new rules more easily.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule closer. Let me see, the ""ball"" rule is 8 steps right and 2 down. I can try moving right multiple times to get there.

But I'm blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can make the walls stop, then I can walk through them.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, that wall becomes a stop block, which I can't move through. That's the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, if I can make the walls not stop, then I can pass through them. Maybe by moving the ""wall"" rule to change their properties.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ball's position. The ball is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. If I can reach the ball, maybe I can use it somehow.

But again, the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""key is push,"" then I can push the key to reach it.

But I'm not sure. I think the best bet is to try to make myself a ball to move through walls. So I need to create ""ball is you.""

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you."" The ""ball"" rule is 8 right and 2 down. The ""is"" rule is 7 right and 2 up. The ""you"" rule is 4 steps down.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule closer. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is 7 right and 2 up. If I can move it to the left, I can create new rules more easily.

But I'm not sure how to move it without being blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, that wall becomes a stop block, which I can't move through. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to change the walls' properties. For example, making ""wall is push"" so I can push them.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Maybe I should try moving the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, which might not help.

Alternatively, making ""key is win"" is already the case. Maybe I can make ""key is push"" to push it.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule to create ""ball is you.""

So, I need to move the ""ball"" rule to the position where ""is"" and ""you"" are. The ""ball"" rule is 8 right and 2 down. The ""is"" rule is 7 right and 2 up. The ""you"" rule is 4 down.

This seems too far. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see, the key is 1 right and 2 up. If I can move up twice and right once, I can reach it, but the walls are blocking me.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can make the walls not stop, then I can walk through them.

But how? The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up. If I move it to a wall, that wall becomes a stop block. That's the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change the walls' properties. For example, making ""wall is pass"" or something, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. There are walls around, which probably block my movement. There are also several rule blocks scattered around, like ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

I need to figure out how to move the key or change the rules so I can reach it. Since the key is 1 right and 2 up, I should check if there's a clear path. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the walls into something else or remove them.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule block 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being walls. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make them immovable, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" I could merge with the walls, but that seems risky.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule block, maybe I can change the win condition. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach myself, which is always true. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Wait, the ""key"" is the win condition, so I need to get to it. Let me see the positions again. The key is at (1 right, 2 up). There are walls at (3 right, 2 up), (3 right, 1 up), (3 right), (3 right, 1 down), etc. So the path to the key is blocked by walls on the right side.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule block, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule block to the wall's position, making the wall stop being a wall. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Let me think about the movement. I can move up, right, down, or left. Since the key is up and to the right, I might need to move up first to get around the walls. But the walls are also up, so maybe I can go around them by moving left or right.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule block is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change my own properties. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I become the key, which might help. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to a different position, making the actual key object somewhere else. But I'm not sure how that would help.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, ""wall is stop"" could make them immovable, but they already are.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule block is 1 step up. If I move it to where the wall is, maybe I can make that wall stop being a wall. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule block to a different position, but I don't see a clear path to do that.

Maybe I should try moving left to see if there's a way around. If I move left, I can avoid the walls on the right. Let me try that.

So, I'll move left first. That should take me away from the walls on the right, giving me space to maneuver. Once I'm left of the walls, I can try moving up to reach the key.

Yes, moving left seems like a good first step to avoid the walls blocking my path to the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There are walls around, which probably block my movement. The rules are laid out as text blocks that I can move to change the game's rules.

I notice that the key is two steps right and two up. To get there, I need to move right twice and up twice. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Let me check the walls' positions.

There's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 up, which is beyond the key's position. So, moving right twice and up twice should be possible without hitting that wall. Also, there are walls at 4 right and 1 up, 4 right, and 4 right and 1 down, but those are further to the right, so they shouldn't block my path to the key.

Wait, but I also see a rule `stop` at 1 right and 1 up. If I move right once and up once, I might hit that stop rule, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that.

So, maybe I should move up first to bypass the stop rule. Let me plan my steps:

1. Move up once to go from my current position to one step up.
2. Then move right twice to reach the key's column.
3. Then move up once more to reach the key.

But I need to make sure that moving up first doesn't lead me into any walls. Let me check the walls again. There's a wall at 4 right and 2 up, but if I'm moving up first, I'll be at 0 right and 1 up, then right twice to 2 right and 1 up, then up to 2 right and 2 up, which is where the key is. That seems safe.

Alternatively, I could move right first, but that might take me closer to the stop rule. So moving up first seems better to avoid any potential issues.

Wait, but the stop rule is at 1 right and 1 up. If I move right once and then up once, I'd be at 1 right and 1 up, which is the stop rule. That would prevent me from moving further, so I definitely don't want that.

So, moving up first to 0 right and 1 up, then right twice to 2 right and 1 up, then up to 2 right and 2 up where the key is. That should work.

Let me visualize the path:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move up to (0,1)
- Move right to (1,1) – but wait, there's a stop rule at (1,1). Oh no, that's a problem. If I move right from (0,1) to (1,1), I hit the stop rule, which would stop me.

So, that path is blocked. I need another way.

Maybe I should move right first, but avoid the stop rule. Let's see:

- Start at (0,0)
- Move right to (1,0)
- Then up to (1,1) – again, the stop rule. Not good.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the stop rule not stop me. But how?

I can move the stop rule's text blocks. The stop rule is formed by the rule `stop` at 1 right and 1 up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, I can avoid it.

But to move the rule, I need to move the text blocks. The rule `stop` is at 1 right and 1 up. The subject is ""stop,"" so I can move the ""stop"" text block.

Wait, but moving text blocks requires that they are not defined as stop. Since the current rule is ""stop is stop,"" I can't move the stop text block because it's immovable. So, I can't change the stop rule's position because it's defined as stop.

That's a problem. Maybe I need to change the rule so that stop is not stop anymore. How can I do that?

I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" text blocks to form a new rule. For example, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then I can move the stop rule. But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing rule by moving one of its parts. If I move the ""stop"" text block, the rule ""stop is stop"" would be broken, and the stop rule would no longer exist. That could allow me to move through where the stop rule was.

But how do I move the ""stop"" text block? Since it's currently part of the stop rule, it's immovable. I need to change that.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" text block. If I move the ""is"" in the stop rule, the rule would be broken, and the stop rule would be disabled. Let me see where the ""is"" text blocks are.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 8 steps to the right and 2 step up, another at 2 steps down, and another at 4 steps down. So, I can move one of these ""is"" blocks to break the stop rule.

For example, if I move the ""is"" block at 8 right and 2 up somewhere else, the stop rule would be broken because the ""is"" is missing. Then, the stop rule would no longer be active, and I could move through that area.

But to move the ""is"" block, I need to be able to reach it. It's at 8 right and 2 up, which is far to the right. I'm at (0,0), so I'd need to move right 8 times and up 2 times, which is a long path and might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move another ""is"" block that's closer. There's a rule `is` at 2 steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can break the stop rule.

Wait, but moving an ""is"" block would affect all rules that use ""is,"" which is a lot. That might not be a good idea because it could break other rules I need.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another way to reach the key without going through the stop rule.

Let me look again at the key's position: 2 right and 2 up. Are there any other paths to get there without hitting the stop rule?

If I move up twice first, I'd be at (0,2). Then, moving right twice would take me to (2,2), which is the key's position. Let me check if that path is clear.

From (0,0) to (0,1) to (0,2) – are there any walls or stop rules in that column? The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so moving up in the same column shouldn't hit any walls. Then, moving right twice from (0,2) to (2,2) – are there walls there? The wall is at 4 right and 2 up, so (4,2) is a wall, but (2,2) is clear.

So, moving up twice first, then right twice, might work. Let me plan that:

1. Move up to (0,1)
2. Move up again to (0,2)
3. Move right to (1,2)
4. Move right again to (2,2) – where the key is.

But wait, when I move right from (0,2) to (1,2), is there a wall or stop rule there? The walls are at 4 right and 2 up, so (4,2) is a wall, but (1,2) is clear. Also, the stop rule is at (1,1), so moving right from (0,2) to (1,2) is safe.

Yes, that seems like a viable path. So, the steps would be:

- up
- up
- right
- right

But I need to make sure that each move is valid and doesn't hit any walls or stop rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first, but that would take me closer to the stop rule. So, moving up first is safer.

Wait, but when I move up twice, I'm at (0,2). Then, moving right twice to (2,2). That should be fine because the walls are further to the right.

So, the plan is:

1. Move up
2. Move up
3. Move right
4. Move right

But I need to output just one action at a time. So, the first action would be ""up.""

Wait, but the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So, in the current state, I'm at (0,0). The key is at (2,2). The stop rule is at (1,1). So, moving up first to (0,1), then up to (0,2), then right twice to (2,2).

But in the current observation, the key is at 2 right and 2 up, so (2,2). The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so they don't block the path to (2,2).

So, the first move should be up to (0,1). Then, up again to (0,2). Then, right twice to (2,2).

But I need to make sure that moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is possible. Is there a wall or stop rule there? The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so (0,1) is clear.

Yes, moving up is safe. So, the first action is ""up.""

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. There are walls around, which I can't pass through unless I change the rules. The rules are laid out as text blocks: ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to create new rules or modify existing ones.

I need to figure out how to move the key closer or make a path to it. Since the key is two steps right and one up, I might need to move some walls or rules to create a clear path. Alternatively, I could change the rules to make the key reachable or make myself able to pass through walls.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is present. If I can make something ""stop,"" it might prevent movement, but I'm not sure how that helps yet. Maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make walls immovable, but that might not help me get to the key.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, moving ""baba"" next to ""you"" might change my properties, but I'm already ""you.""

Let me think about the positions. The key is at (2 right, 1 up). There are walls around it, so I might need to break through or go around. If I can move the walls, that could help. But walls are usually immovable unless I change their properties.

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is at (1 left). If I move the ""stop"" rule next to ""wall,"" making ""wall is stop,"" that would make walls immovable, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, if I can make walls passable, that would help me reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change what counts as the win condition. If I make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ball is at (2 right, 4 down). Maybe I can use the ball to break something, but I'm not sure how.

Let me try to visualize the map. The key is two right and one up. There are walls around it, so I need to find a way to get past them. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties of the walls.

If I can make ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, making ""wall is win"" would make the walls the win condition, but I need to get to the key.

Hmm, perhaps I should try moving the ""key"" rule to a different position to change the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win when I reach myself, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""key"" to reinforce that the key is the win condition. But I'm not sure if that changes anything.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to block the key, but that would prevent me from winning.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" making me the key, but I'm not sure if that works.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""you,"" making the key me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule like ""ball is win,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" making walls immovable, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule to a different position to change the walls' properties.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to ""wall,"" making ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable, but I need to pass through them to get to the key.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule to a different position to see if it changes the win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to a different position to change my properties.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win when I reach myself, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule to a different position to change my properties.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is key,"" making me the key, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" making me the key.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, and since ""key is win,"" I would win when I reach myself. That might work.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key."" Let me see where the ""is"" rule is. It's at (8 right, 1 up). The ""baba"" rule is at (1 left, 5 down). The ""key"" rule is at (7 right, 1 up).

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to create ""baba is key.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to create ""baba is key.""

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. I need to move the text blocks to form the new rule.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" forming ""baba is key.""

So, I need to move the ""key"" rule from (7 right, 1 up) to a position where it's next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

But ""baba"" is at (1 left, 5 down), and ""is"" is at (8 right, 1 up). That's a long distance. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""key.""

But again, the distances are too far.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""key.""

But ""baba"" is at (1 left, 5 down), and ""is"" is at (8 right, 1 up). That's too far.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think differently.

Since the key is two right and one up, and there are walls around, maybe I can move the walls to create a path.

But walls are usually immovable unless I change their properties.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become immovable, but I need to pass through them.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls become me, but that might not help.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is win,"" making walls the win condition, but I need to reach the key.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to block the key, but that would prevent me from winning.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to block the key, but that doesn't help me reach it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule like ""ball is win,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""ball is win,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""key"" to make ""ball is key,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""ball"" rule to a position where it's next to ""is"" and ""key,"" making ""ball is key,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to a position where it's next to ""is"" and ""win,"" making ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if that helps me reach the key.

Wait, maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule to a different position to change the win condition.

If I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would become me, and I would win when I reach myself.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule next to ""key"" and ""is,"" making ""key is you.""

That might work.

So, I need to move the ""you"" rule from (1 right, 5 down) to a position where it's next to ""key"" and ""is.""

But ""key"" is at (7 right, 1 up), and ""is"" is at (8 right, 1 up). So, if I can move ""you"" to (6 right, 1 up), then ""key is you"" would be formed.

But moving ""you"" that far is not possible in one move.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""key"" and ""you.""

But ""is"" is at (8 right, 1 up), and ""key"" is at (7 right, 1 up), and ""you"" is at (1 right, 5 down). That's too far.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me look at the ball. The ball is at (2 right, 4 down). Maybe I can use the ball to break something, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, if I can make the ball push the key, but I don't know how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule like ""ball is win,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" making ""ball is win,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""key,"" making ""ball is key,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""ball"" rule to a position where it's next to ""is"" and ""you,"" making ""ball is you,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to a position where it's next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" making ""ball is stop,"" but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule to block the key, but that would prevent me from winning.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to block the walls, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make ""stop is win,"" making the stop condition the win, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" making ""stop is win,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule next to ""is"" and ""key,"" making ""stop is key,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba,"" making ""stop is baba,"" but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule to a different position to change the win condition.

If I can make ""key is you,"" then I would win when I reach the key, which I already am, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can make ""key is win"" again, but that's already the active rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule to a different position to change the win condition.

If I can make ""win is key,"" that's the same as ""key is win,"" so it doesn't change anything.

Wait, maybe I can make ""win is you,"" making me the win condition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba,"" making ""win is baba,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""win is stop,"" making the win condition stopping, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" making ""win is stop,"" but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" making me the key.

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""key.""

But ""baba"" is at (1 left, 5 down), and ""key"" is at (7 right, 1 up). That's too far.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

But again, the distances are too far.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""key.""

But ""baba"" is at (1 left, 5 down), and ""is"" is at (8 right, 1 up). That's too far.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the current setup.

The key is two right and one up, surrounded by walls. I need to get there. The rules are laid out in a line on the right side. Maybe I can move the rules to create a bridge or something.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become immovable, but I need to pass through them. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls become me, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is win,"" making walls the win condition, but I need to reach the key.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule to a different position to change their properties.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is key,"" then walls become the key, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""key,"" making ""wall is key,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" making ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable, but I need to pass through them.

Hmm, this is frustrating. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule to a different position to change the win condition.

If I can make ""key is you,"" then I would win when I reach the key, which I already am, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can make ""key is win"" again, but that's already the active rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule to a different position to change the win condition.

If I can make ""win is key,"" that's the same as ""key is win,"" so it doesn't change anything.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. There are walls around, which probably block my movement. The rules are laid out as text blocks that I can move to change the game's rules.

I notice that the key is positioned in a way that might be blocked by walls. I need to figure out how to get to it. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I have to avoid the walls unless I can change the rules to make them passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule nearby. If I can move the ""stop"" rule onto a wall, that wall becomes immovable, but maybe I can use that to my advantage. Alternatively, if I can break the ""stop"" rule, perhaps the walls become passable.

Let me think about the text blocks. There are rules like ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I can move these around to create new rules or modify existing ones.

If I move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop,"" maybe I can make a new rule like ""stop is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that would make walls immovable, which might not help me.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. If I can change that rule, maybe I can become something else, but I don't see a benefit in that right now.

Looking at the key's position, it's two steps right and one up. I need to see if there's a clear path. The walls are at 4 steps right and 1 up, so maybe I can go around them.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""key"" rule to make the key something else, but that might not help. Maybe I can make ""key is you,"" but that would make me the key, which might not be useful.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right. If I can move the ""stop"" rule onto a wall, that wall becomes stop, meaning I can't move through it. But if I can remove the ""stop"" rule, maybe the walls become passable.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't know if that's possible.

Let me try to move towards the key. Since the key is two steps right and one up, I can try moving right twice and up once. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, they are at 4 steps right and 1 up, so maybe the path to the key is clear. Let me try moving right twice and up once.

Wait, but in the previous observations, moving up didn't get me closer. Maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I need to break the ""key is win"" rule. If I can make ""key is not win,"" then the key won't be the win condition anymore, but that might not help me.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me. But I don't see a way to do that immediately.

Let me try moving towards the key. I'll move right twice and up once. If that doesn't work, I'll have to think of another strategy.

Wait, in the current observation, the key is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The walls are at 4 steps right and 1 up, so maybe the path is clear. Let me try moving right twice and up once.

But in the previous attempt, moving up didn't get me closer. Maybe I need to adjust my movement.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" but again, I don't see that option.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls to make them passable.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's at 1 step to the right. If I move it left, maybe I can place it somewhere else, making the walls not stop anymore.

Let me try moving left once to get the ""stop"" rule out of the way. Then, the walls might become passable.

Wait, but moving left once would take me away from the key. Maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become me, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, if I can make ""you is wall,"" then I would become a wall, which might not help.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me try moving up once to see if that helps.

Wait, in the previous attempt, moving up didn't get me closer. Maybe I need to move right first.

Let me try moving right once. Then, I can assess the situation better.

Wait, but the key is two steps right and one up. Maybe I need to move right twice and then up once.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first and then right. Let me try that.

Wait, moving up once might not get me closer. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it easier to reach. But I don't know how to do that.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule to a different position, but I don't see a way to do that immediately.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is here,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try moving right twice and up once to reach the key.

But in the previous attempts, moving up didn't work. Maybe I need to adjust my movement.

Wait, perhaps I need to move right once, then up once, then right again. Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move up first, then right twice.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to try a different action.

Let me try moving left once to see if that helps. Maybe I can access some rules that way.

Wait, but moving left might take me away from the key. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to access some other rules, but I don't see any useful ones there.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" rule nearby. Maybe I can use that somehow, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule that helps me.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, but I don't know where the ball is.

Looking at the objects, the ball is at 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down. That's far from me. Maybe that's not useful right now.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can ignore the ball and focus on the key.

Wait, let me try moving right once. Then, I can see if I can move up.

If I move right once, I'll be closer to the key. Then, moving up once might get me to the key's position.

Wait, but in the previous attempts, moving up didn't work. Maybe I need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move right twice and then up once.

Let me try that. Move right once, then right again, then up once.

But I'm not sure if that will work. Let me try it step by step.

First, move right once. Now, I'm one step to the right. Then, move right again. Now, I'm two steps to the right. Then, move up once. That should get me to the key's position.

Wait, but in the previous observations, moving up didn't get me closer. Maybe the walls are blocking me.

Alternatively, maybe I need to break through the walls somehow.

Wait, if I can make the walls passable, then I can reach the key. How can I do that?

Looking at the rules, the walls are defined by the ""wall"" rule. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make walls passable.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me. But I don't see a way to do that immediately.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, maybe they become passable.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right. If I move it left, maybe the walls lose their stop property.

Let me try moving left once to take the ""stop"" rule away from the walls. Then, the walls might become passable.

Wait, but moving left once would take me away from the key. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule without moving myself.

Wait, no, I'm Baba, so I have to move to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Let me try that.

Move left once to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Now, the ""stop"" rule is with me. Then, I can move it somewhere else, making the walls not stop anymore.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me try it.

After moving left once, I'm at the ""stop"" rule. Now, I can move it to a different location, perhaps far away from the walls.

Then, the walls would no longer have the stop property, making them passable.

Once the walls are passable, I can move through them to reach the key.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left once to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, away from the walls.
3. Then, move towards the key, passing through the walls.

Let me try that.

First, move left once. Now, I'm at the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it, say, down to a safe location.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe just moving the ""stop"" rule away from the walls is enough.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule onto a wall to make it immovable, but that's the opposite of what I want.

Wait, no, I want to make the walls passable, so I need to remove the ""stop"" rule from them.

So, moving the ""stop"" rule away should do that.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls are no longer stop, so I can pass through them.

Then, I can move right twice and up once to reach the key.

Let me try that.

First, move left once to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Now, I'm at the ""stop"" rule.

Then, move down once to place the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. Now, the walls are no longer stop.

Now, I can move right twice and up once to reach the key.

Wait, but in the current observation, the key is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So, moving right twice and up once should get me there.

Let me try that.

Move right once, then right again, then up once. That should get me to the key.

But in the previous attempts, moving up didn't work. Maybe because the walls were blocking me. Now that the walls are passable, I can move up.

So, the actions would be:

1. left (to pick up ""stop"")
2. down (to move ""stop"" away)
3. right
4. right
5. up

But I can only choose one action at a time. So, I need to choose the next action based on the current state.

In the current observation, I'm at the starting position. The key is at 2 right, 1 up. The walls are at 4 right, 1 up, and other positions.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right. So, I can move left once to pick it up.

So, the first action should be left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. There are walls around, which probably block my movement. The rules are laid out as text blocks that I can move to change the game's rules.

I notice that there are several rule blocks: ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be rearranged to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make the walls stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is currently 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move it to a wall to make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, I could try to change the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule to something else, but since the key is already win, maybe that's not needed.

I think the key is the main objective, so I should focus on getting to it. The key is 2 right and 1 up. Let me see the path. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might be blocking the way. Maybe I can move a rule block to change the wall's properties.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left. If I can move that to a different position, maybe I can make a wall stop being a wall. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to the ""stop"" rule, making ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, but that might not help since I need to reach the key to win. Or perhaps ""key is you,"" which would make the key me, but that might complicate things.

Wait, if I can move the ""key"" rule to a different position, maybe I can change what the key does. For example, if I make ""key is win"" into ""key is something else,"" but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, I could make ""key is move"" or ""key is push,"" but I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Another idea: maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Alternatively, ""wall is move"" might allow me to move through walls, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the ball, it's 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used somehow, but I'm not sure how. The ""ball"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball do something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I can move that to a wall, maybe I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is win,"" but that might not help.

I think the best approach is to try to move towards the key. Since the key is 2 right and 1 up, I should try to move in that direction. Let me check if there are any walls blocking that path. The wall is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, so maybe I can go around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move a rule block to create a path. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, making that area not a wall anymore. But I'm not sure how to do that exactly.

Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left, maybe I can place it somewhere else. But I'm not sure where. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me.

I think I need to try moving towards the key. Let me try moving right twice and up once. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. If there are walls, I might need to change the rules to move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it stop me, but I'm not sure. I think I'll try moving right twice and up once to see if I can reach the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 1 step to the right and 1 step up. There are walls around, which I can't pass through. The rules are laid out as text blocks that I can move to change the game's rules.

I need to figure out how to get to the key. Since the key is up and to the right, I should try moving in that direction. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Let me check the walls' positions.

There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. That might be in the way if I go straight up. Also, there are other walls at various positions, so I need to navigate carefully.

Maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is jump,"" I could jump over walls, but I don't see a ""jump"" rule available.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is present. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the key.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule block, maybe I can change what counts as the win condition. But since the key is already the win, maybe that's not necessary.

Let me think about the movement. I'm at the starting position, and the key is up and to the right. I can try moving right first, then up. But I need to check if the path is clear.

If I move right once, I'll be at (1,0). Then up once to (1,1), which is where the key is. But is there a wall there? The wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step up, so that's (3,1). So the path to (1,1) should be clear.

Wait, but the wall is at (3,1), so moving to (1,1) shouldn't be blocked. So maybe I can just move right and then up.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move up first, then right. Let me see. If I move up, I might hit a wall or not. The wall is at (3,1), so moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is clear. Then right to (1,1), which is the key.

Yes, that seems possible. So the plan is: move up, then right.

But wait, the key is at (1,1), so moving up to (0,1), then right to (1,1) should work. Let me check if there are any walls in that path.

Looking at the walls, the closest one is at (3,1), so the path to (1,1) is clear. So I can move up, then right to reach the key.

Alternatively, I could move right first, then up. Let's see: right to (1,0), then up to (1,1). That should also work.

I think either way is fine. Maybe moving up first is better to avoid any potential issues with walls on the right side.

So, I'll choose to move up first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is just one step to the right. That seems pretty straightforward, but there are a lot of walls and other rules around. I need to make sure I can move towards the key without getting blocked.

The walls are positioned in a way that might be creating a barrier. There are walls three steps to the right, and some walls with steps down. I also see rule blocks for 'key,' 'is,' 'win,' 'wall,' 'stop,' 'ball,' 'baba,' and 'you.' These rule blocks can be moved to change the rules of the level.

Since the key is only one step to the right, maybe I can just move right and pick it up. But I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. The walls are three steps to the right, so if I move right once, I should be next to the key without hitting a wall. Wait, but the walls are also at three steps to the right, so maybe moving right once would take me to the position where the wall is. That could block my path.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. For example, if I can move the 'stop' rule block, I might be able to make the walls not stop me. Or perhaps I can change what counts as the win condition to something else if that helps.

But since the key is right next to me, maybe it's simpler to just move right. Let me try that. If I move right, I should be able to reach the key and win the level. I don't see any immediate obstacles in that path, so it's worth a try.
