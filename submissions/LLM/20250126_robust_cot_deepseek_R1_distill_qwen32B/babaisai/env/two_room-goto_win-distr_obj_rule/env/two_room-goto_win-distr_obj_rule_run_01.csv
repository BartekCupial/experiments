Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key two steps to the left. So, my goal is to get to that key. But wait, there are walls around me. Let me visualize the map based on the descriptions.

I see walls in several places: one step right and two up, another right and one up, and others down. There are also rule blocks scattered around. The key is two steps left, but I need to check if there's a path there.

I notice a ball three steps left and two down. There's a ""stop"" rule one step left and two down. Hmm, maybe the ball is blocking something or can be used to change rules.

The rules are spread out. For example, there's a ""wall"" rule four steps left and one up, and ""is"" three steps left and one up. Maybe I can move these to change the properties of walls or other objects.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The ""stop"" rule is near the ball. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the ball stop or start moving.

Wait, the key is two steps left. Let me check if there's a wall blocking that path. The walls are mostly to the right and down, so maybe I can move left without issues. But I should be careful about any other obstacles.

I think the best first step is to move left to get closer to the key. That way, I can assess if there are any walls or other rules in the way. So, I'll choose the left action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means right now, the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and two steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: key, is, win, wall, etc., spread out. The key is one step to the left, which is closer to me. There's also a ball two steps to the left and two steps down, and a stop rule two steps down. 

Hmm, the stop rule is two steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules. But wait, the stop rule is probably making something immovable. I need to see if I can break that or move it to change the rules.

I think the key is to the left, so maybe I should move left to get to it. But I need to check if there are any walls or other obstacles in the way. The wall is two steps to the right and two steps up, so that's not directly blocking me from moving left. 

Wait, the key is one step to the left. So if I move left once, I should reach it. But I need to make sure that moving left is possible. Are there any walls or other objects in that path? The wall is two steps to the right and two steps up, so that's not in the way. The key is directly to the left, so maybe I can just move left.

But wait, the active rule is ""key is win,"" so when I reach the key, I win. So moving left once should do it. Let me try that.
