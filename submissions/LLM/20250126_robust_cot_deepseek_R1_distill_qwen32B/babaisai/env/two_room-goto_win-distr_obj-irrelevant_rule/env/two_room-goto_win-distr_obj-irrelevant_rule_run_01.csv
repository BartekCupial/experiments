Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means the door is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step up from my current position. There's also a key one step to the right and up. Walls are scattered around, which probably block movement. The rules are spread out as text blocks: 'door', 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'ball', 'baba', 'you', etc.

My goal is to reach the door to win. But there's a key nearby, so maybe I need to pick it up first. However, I can't move through walls, so I need to figure out how to get around them.

Wait, the rules are made up of text blocks. If I can move those, I can change the rules. For example, if I can move the 'stop' rule, maybe I can make walls stop me or not. Or perhaps I can change what 'win' is.

Let me see the positions. The 'stop' rule is one step to the right and two up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the 'is' and 'win' blocks. For example, if I can make 'key is win', then the key becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the door is one step up. There's a wall four steps to the right and three up. So maybe the door is behind a wall? Or perhaps the walls are in a way that blocks my path.

I'm at the starting position. Let me try to move up to the door. But if there's a wall in the way, I can't. So maybe I need to break the wall or change the rules so that walls don't stop me.

Looking at the rules, the 'stop' rule is separate. If I can move the 'stop' rule next to a wall, maybe I can make walls stop me. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, if I can move the 'is' and 'stop' blocks to create a new rule like 'wall is stop', then walls would block movement. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the current rules are 'door is win' and 'baba is you'. So I can move Baba around. The key is next to me, so maybe I can pick it up. But how does the key help? Maybe it's needed to open the door, but in this game, the door is the win condition, so maybe I just need to reach it.

But if the door is blocked by a wall, I can't reach it. So perhaps I need to change the rules so that walls don't stop me. How can I do that?

I see a 'stop' rule. If I can move the 'stop' rule away from the walls, maybe walls won't stop me. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like 'wall is not stop'.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move the 'stop' block to a different position, maybe I can change the rules.

Alternatively, I can move the 'is' block and the 'stop' block to create a new rule. For example, moving 'wall' next to 'is' and 'stop' to make 'wall is stop', which would make walls stop me. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, maybe the walls are already stopping me because of the 'stop' rule. So if I can remove that rule, I can pass through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a different subject. For example, if I can make 'key is stop', then the key would stop me, but that might not help.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and the door is one step up. There's a key to the right and up. Walls are around, but I'm not sure exactly where.

Wait, the walls are at various positions: 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, etc. So maybe the door is behind a wall, and I need to get around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the key, making the key the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the key is one step right and up. If I can move there, maybe I can pick it up. But if the path is blocked by walls, I can't.

So perhaps the solution is to change the rules so that walls don't stop me. How can I do that?

I see the 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move the 'stop' block to a different position, maybe I can change the rules.

Alternatively, I can move the 'is' block and the 'stop' block to create a new rule. For example, moving 'wall' next to 'is' and 'stop' to make 'wall is stop', but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, maybe the walls are already stopping me because of the 'stop' rule. So if I can remove that rule, I can pass through walls.

Alternatively, I can move the 'stop' rule to a different subject. For example, if I can make 'key is stop', then the key would stop me, but that might not help.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving the 'stop' rule away. Let me see, the 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can change the rules.

Wait, but I can only move text blocks that are not defined as 'stop' or similar. So if the 'stop' rule is a text block, I can move it.

So, perhaps I can move the 'stop' rule to a different position, making it not associated with walls anymore. That way, walls won't stop me.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving 'is' and 'stop' to a different subject.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' block to make a new rule. For example, moving 'is' next to 'win' and 'door' to make 'door is win', which is already the case.

Alternatively, I can move the 'is' block to create a new rule like 'baba is win', making myself the win condition. But that might not help.

Wait, if I can make 'baba is win', then when I reach the door, which is the current win condition, I might not win. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make 'key is win', so that picking up the key wins the level.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

I need to reach the door, which is one step up. But there's a wall in the way. So I need to either move the wall or change the rules so that walls don't stop me.

Since walls are objects, maybe I can move them, but only if they're not defined as 'stop'. So if the walls are 'stop', I can't move them. But if I can change the rules so that walls are not 'stop', then I can move them.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is a text block. So if I can move the 'stop' block away from the walls, maybe the walls won't stop me.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving 'is' and 'stop' to a different subject.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'stop' block to a different position, making it not associated with walls. That way, walls won't stop me.

So, to do that, I need to move the 'stop' block. It's currently at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can change the rules.

But how? I need to move the 'stop' block, but I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move it to a position where it's not part of any rule.

Alternatively, I can move the 'is' block to create a new rule. For example, moving 'is' next to 'stop' and another subject.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule like 'wall is not stop' by moving the 'not' block, but I don't see a 'not' block in the current rules.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move the 'stop' block. It's at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can change the rules.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' block to create a new rule.

Wait, the 'is' block is at 1 right. If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' block to the key, making the key the win condition. Then, I can just pick up the key and win.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the steps.

1. I'm at the starting position.
2. The door is one step up, but there's a wall in the way.
3. The key is one step right and up.
4. The 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 2 up.

So, perhaps I can move the 'stop' block to a different position, making walls not stop me. Then, I can move through the wall to reach the door.

Alternatively, I can move the 'is' block to create a new rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' block to the key, making the key 'win'. Then, picking up the key would win the level.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to plan the steps.

First, I need to move the 'is' block to the key. The 'is' block is at 1 right. The key is at 1 right and 1 up. So, if I can move the 'is' block up, it would be next to the key.

But how? I can only move text blocks, not objects. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by pushing them, but only if they're not part of a rule.

Wait, the 'is' block is part of the rule 'baba is you', so it's fixed. Or is it? No, in the game, you can move text blocks to create new rules.

Wait, no, the 'is' block is part of the rule 'baba is you', so it's fixed in that position. Or can I move it?

Wait, in the game, you can move text blocks by pushing them, but only if they're not part of a rule. So, if the 'is' block is part of a rule, it's fixed. But if it's not, you can move it.

In this case, the 'is' block is part of the rule 'baba is you', so it's fixed. So I can't move it.

Hmm, that complicates things. So I can't move the 'is' block because it's part of a rule.

Wait, but maybe I can break the rule by moving one of the parts. For example, if I can move the 'baba' block, then the rule 'baba is you' would be broken, and I would no longer be Baba.

But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'you' block. It's at 1 right and 3 down. If I can move it, I can create a new rule.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

I need to reach the door, which is one step up. There's a wall in the way. So I need to either move the wall or change the rules so that walls don't stop me.

Since I can't move the walls (they're objects, not text blocks), I need to change the rules.

The 'stop' rule is a text block at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move it, I can change the rules.

So, perhaps I can move the 'stop' block to a different position, making it not associated with walls anymore. That way, walls won't stop me.

But how? I need to move the 'stop' block. It's at 1 right and 2 up. So, from my current position, I can move right once and up twice to reach it.

Wait, but I'm at the starting position. Let me see the positions:

- Starting position: let's say (0,0)
- Door: 1 up (0,1)
- Key: 1 right and 1 up (1,1)
- 'stop' rule: 1 right and 2 up (1,2)
- Walls are at various positions, including 4 right and 3 up (4,3), etc.

So, to reach the 'stop' block, I need to move right once and up twice. But there's a wall at (4,3), but that's far away. Wait, no, the walls are at 4 right and 3 up, which is (4,3), but I'm at (0,0). So the path to the 'stop' block is clear?

Wait, no, because there are walls at 4 right and 3 up, but that's far to the right. So maybe the path to the 'stop' block is clear.

Wait, but the walls are at 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, etc. So from (0,0), moving right once and up twice would take me to (1,2), which is where the 'stop' block is. But are there any walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls:

- wall 4 steps right and 3 step up: (4,3)
- wall 4 steps right and 2 step up: (4,2)
- wall 4 steps right and 1 step up: (4,1)
- wall 4 steps right: (4,0)
- wall 4 steps right and 1 step down: (4,-1)
- wall 4 steps right and 2 steps down: (4,-2)
- wall 4 steps right and 3 steps down: (4,-3)

So, the walls are all at x=4, varying y positions. So from (0,0), moving right once and up twice would take me to (1,2), which is clear because the walls are at x=4. So I can reach the 'stop' block.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right once to (1,0).
2. Move up twice to (1,2), where the 'stop' block is.
3. Push the 'stop' block to a different position, perhaps down to (1,1), which is where the key is.

Wait, but the key is at (1,1). If I push the 'stop' block down to (1,1), it would be on top of the key. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Alternatively, I can push the 'stop' block to the right or left.

Wait, but I'm at (1,2). If I push the 'stop' block up, it would go to (1,3), which is empty. Then, the 'stop' block is moved, and the rule 'stop' is no longer associated with anything, so walls won't stop me.

Wait, but in the game, moving a text block changes the rules. So if I move the 'stop' block away from its current position, the rule 'stop' is removed, and walls won't stop me anymore.

So, by moving the 'stop' block, I can make walls passable.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Move up to (1,1).
3. Move up again to (1,2), where the 'stop' block is.
4. Push the 'stop' block up to (1,3).

Now, the 'stop' rule is moved, so walls no longer stop me. Then, I can move through the walls to reach the door.

Wait, but the door is at (0,1). So after moving the 'stop' block, I can go back to (0,0), then up to (0,1) to win.

But wait, after moving the 'stop' block, I can move through walls. So perhaps I can go up through the wall to reach the door.

Alternatively, maybe the wall is at (0,1), but I'm not sure. Wait, the door is at (0,1), and the wall is at 4 right and 3 up, which is (4,3). So the door is not behind a wall. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the door is at 1 step up, which is (0,1). There's a wall at 4 right and 3 up, which is (4,3). So the door is not blocked by a wall. So why can't I just move up to win?

Ah, maybe because the door is the win condition, but I'm blocked by something else. Or perhaps the door is behind a wall that I can't pass because of the 'stop' rule.

Wait, maybe the door is at (0,1), and there's a wall at (0,1). No, the door is an object, so it's placed on the map. So perhaps the door is at (0,1), and I can reach it by moving up, but there's a wall in the way.

Wait, the walls are at x=4, so they're far to the right. So maybe the path to the door is clear. So why can't I just move up?

Wait, perhaps the door is the win condition, but I need to pick up the key first. Or maybe the door is locked and requires the key.

Wait, in the game, the door is the win condition, so reaching it wins the level. But if it's locked, you need the key. But in this case, the key is next to me, so maybe I need to pick it up first.

But how? The key is at (1,1). So I can move right and up to get it. But if the walls are stopping me, I can't.

Wait, but if I move the 'stop' block, I can pass through walls. So perhaps I should do that first.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Move up to (1,1) to get the key.
3. Then, move up again to (1,2) to get the 'stop' block.
4. Push the 'stop' block up to (1,3).

Now, walls don't stop me anymore. Then, I can move up to (0,1) to reach the door and win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the door is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step up from my current position. There's also a key one step to the right and up. I remember that in Baba Is You, keys usually open doors, so maybe I need to get the key to open the door and win.

But wait, the door is already the win condition. So maybe I just need to reach the door. However, there are walls around, so I might need to move some rules or objects to clear a path.

I see several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""wall"" rule one step to the left and two steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the properties of walls. If I make walls stop being walls, I can walk through them.

Let me think about how to move the rule blocks. I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" Since the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you,"" I can move other rule blocks if they aren't set as stop.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the right and two steps up. That means that rule is set as stop, so I can't move it. But the ""wall"" rule is separate, so maybe I can move it.

If I move the ""wall"" rule to combine it with another rule, like ""is,"" I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But that might not help me.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""something else,"" maybe I can change the wall's properties. Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I could make ""wall is you,"" which would let me control walls. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Another idea: the key is next to me. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can use it to open the door. But in Baba Is You, keys usually require a rule like ""key is open"" or something similar. Let me check if there's a rule involving the key. I don't see any active rules about the key, so maybe I need to create one.

If I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""open,"" I can make ""key is open,"" which would allow me to open the door. But I don't see an ""open"" rule on the map. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use the existing rules to my advantage. The door is the win condition, so if I can reach it, I win. But there are walls blocking me. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to change its properties.

If I move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" making ""door is stop,"" then the door becomes immovable, which might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""door is you,"" I could control the door, but that might not be necessary.

Let me think about the key again. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to change the door's rule. For example, if I have the key, I can move the ""door"" rule to make ""door is win"" into something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps up. If I can bring it closer, maybe I can change the win condition.

Wait, the key is one step to the right and up. So if I move right and up, I can pick up the key. Let me try that. So, from my current position, moving right and up would take me to the key. Then, I can hold the key and maybe use it to change rules.

But I need to make sure that moving right and up is possible. Are there any walls blocking that path? The observation says there's a wall four steps to the right and three steps up, but I'm not sure about the immediate steps. I think moving right and up from my position is clear.

So, my plan is to move right and up to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can look for ways to use it to change the rules, maybe to open the door or change the win condition.

Wait, but in the initial observation, the door is one step up. So if I move up, I can reach the door. But the door is the win condition, so maybe I can just move up to win. But there's a wall blocking me? Or is the door accessible?

Looking back, the door is one step up, and there's a wall four steps to the right and three steps up. So maybe the door is accessible. Let me try moving up first.

If I move up, I can reach the door and win. But why is the key there? Maybe the door is locked, and I need the key to open it. So, I need to pick up the key first.

So, I should move right and up to get the key, then move up to the door. But I need to make sure that the key allows me to open the door. Maybe the key is required to change the door's rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key is just a distraction, and I can win by moving up to the door without it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, if I reach the door, I win. So, maybe I don't need the key. But why is the key there? Maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it's needed for something else.

But to be safe, I'll try moving up to the door first. If that doesn't work, I'll go for the key.

So, my action would be to move up.
