Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall one step to the right and two up. Then there are several rule blocks: 'ball', 'is', 'win' all to the right and up. On the left, there's a 'wall' rule, another 'is', and a key. There's also a wall to the right and up, and another wall to the right. 

Wait, I see a 'stop' rule one step left and down. That might be important because if something is 'stop', it can't be moved. There's a door rule five steps right and two down. A ball is three steps left and three down. Walls are scattered around, and some rules are at the bottom.

So, my goal is to make the ball the win condition, but I'm Baba. I need to reach the ball or change the rules so that I can win. But the ball is three steps left and three down. Let me visualize the map.

I think the key is to the left and up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open the door. But the door is five steps right and two down. Hmm, but I'm Baba, so I can move around unless something is stopping me.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is one step left and down. So if I move there, I might get stopped. I need to avoid that or maybe change the rule so that I can move through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to change what is win. If I can make 'baba is win' instead of 'ball is win', then I just need to reach the exit or something. But how?

Let me see the rule blocks. There's a 'ball' rule four steps right and two up, 'is' next to it, and 'win' after that. So if I can move the 'baba' rule to replace 'ball', maybe I can change the win condition.

Wait, the 'baba' rule is four steps left and four down. So I need to get there. But to get to the 'baba' rule, I have to move left and down. But there's a wall one step right and two up, which might block my path. Also, the 'stop' rule is in the way.

Maybe I can move the 'stop' rule somewhere else. If I can move the 'stop' rule, then I can pass through. But to move it, I need to have a way to pick it up. Since I'm Baba, I can move unless something is stopping me.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the 'is' and 'you' around. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then I just need to reach the exit.

Wait, the 'you' rule is two steps left and four down. So if I can get to that, maybe I can change the rules. But I'm not sure.

Let me think step by step. I'm at the starting position. I need to move towards the ball or change the rules. The ball is three steps left and three down. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through the walls by changing their properties.

Wait, the walls are defined by the 'wall' rule. If I can change the wall's property, maybe I can make them passable. For example, if I can make 'wall is stop', then they can't be moved, but if I can change it to something else, maybe I can pass.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a wall to make it passable. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is one step left and one down. If I can move that, I can maybe make a path. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key. The key is one step left and one up. If I pick up the key, maybe I can open the door. The door is five steps right and two down. So if I go right five and down two, but there are walls in the way.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'door' rule. If I can make 'door is open', then I can pass through. But I don't have an 'open' rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can make 'baba is door' and then open it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the rules. The current rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. So I can move Baba, and the win condition is the ball.

I need to reach the ball, but it's three steps left and three down. Let me see the path. To the left, there's a wall one step right and two up. So maybe I can go up first to avoid the wall.

Wait, if I move up, I can go around the wall. Let me try that. So first, I can move up, then left, then down. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to make it something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the 'is' and 'win' blocks. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then I just need to reach the exit.

But how do I get to the 'baba' rule? It's four steps left and four down. That's a long way. Maybe I can move the 'baba' rule up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'you' rule to make 'baba is you' into something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then I can win by reaching the exit.

But to do that, I need to move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and 'is'. So I need to get to the 'win' rule, which is six steps right and two up. That's on the right side.

Hmm, maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the left. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to the left and down to where the 'baba' rule is. Then, I can make 'baba is win' by rearranging.

Wait, the 'ball' rule is four steps right and two up. If I can move it left, I can bring it near the 'baba' rule.

But moving the 'ball' rule would require me to be able to move it. Since 'ball is win', it's a rule, so I can move it as long as it's not 'stop'.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is one step left and one down. So if I can move that, I can make a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a wall to make it passable. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'stop' rule to the 'ball' rule, making the ball stop. But that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a wall, making the wall stop, but that might block me.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to plan a path.

I need to reach the ball, which is three steps left and three down. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go up first, then left, then down.

So, from my starting position, I can move up, then left, then down. Let me check if that's possible.

Wait, moving up from my position, I can go up one step. Then left, but there's a wall one step right and two up. So maybe I can go up, then left, then down, avoiding the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left first, but there's a wall one step right and two up, so moving left might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I can move up, then right, then up again to go around the wall.

Wait, the wall is one step right and two up. So if I move up, then right, I can go around it.

Let me try that. So first, move up, then right, then up again. Then I can move left towards the ball.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to make it something else.

Wait, if I can make 'baba is win', then I can win by reaching the exit. So how can I do that?

I need to move the 'win' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' rule is six steps right and two up. The 'baba' rule is four steps left and four down. So that's a long distance.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'baba' rule to the right. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then I can win by reaching the exit.

But to do that, I need to have 'baba', 'is', and 'win' in a line. So I need to move the 'win' rule to the left.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'baba' rule to the right. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' rule to the left, so that 'baba' can be connected to 'win'.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the 'ball' rule to the left, making it 'baba is ball', which might not help.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the 'stop' rule first. If I can move it, I can create a path.

The 'stop' rule is one step left and one down. So if I move left and down, I can pick it up. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Wait, since I'm Baba, I can move unless something is stopping me. So if I move to the 'stop' rule, I might get stopped. So maybe I shouldn't move there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to a wall, making the wall stop, but that might block me.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'stop' rule to the 'ball' rule, making the ball stop. But that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to the 'door' rule, making the door stop, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the door is five steps right and two down. If I can open the door, maybe I can reach the ball.

But to open the door, I might need the key. The key is one step left and one up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door.

So maybe I should go get the key first. Let's see, the key is one step left and one up. So from my starting position, I can move left and up.

But wait, moving left from my position, is there a wall? The wall is one step right and two up. So moving left might be possible.

Wait, no, the wall is one step right and two up, so it's to the right, not blocking my left movement. So I can move left and up to get the key.

So, first, I can move left, then up to get the key. Then, with the key, I can open the door.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is five steps right and two down. So from my current position, I need to move right five and down two.

But there are walls in the way. Let me see. The walls are one step right and two up, one step right and one up, one step right, one step right and one down, one step right and two down, one step right and three down, and one step right and four down.

So, moving right from my position, I can go around the walls. Let me try to plan the path.

After getting the key, I need to go right five and down two. Let's see:

From the key's position (one left and one up), I can move right five steps. But there are walls at each step right, so I might be blocked.

Wait, the walls are at one step right and various up and down positions. So maybe I can move down first to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to the door's position.

Wait, the door is five steps right and two down. So from my position after getting the key, I need to move right five and down two.

But with walls in the way, maybe I can move down first, then right.

Let me try:

From the key's position (one left, one up), I can move down two steps to reach the door's level, then move right five steps.

But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

The walls are at one step right and various positions. So moving down two steps from the key's position would take me to the same level as the door. Then moving right five steps, but there are walls at each step right.

Wait, the walls are at one step right and two up, one step right and one up, one step right, one step right and one down, etc. So moving right from the key's position, I might hit a wall.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls to make a path.

Wait, if I can change the walls' properties, I can make them passable. For example, if I can make 'wall is pass', then I can walk through them. But I don't have a 'pass' rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can make 'wall is you', but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'stop' rule to a wall, making it stop, but that might block me.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'door' rule to make it open. But I don't have an 'open' rule.

Wait, maybe I can make 'door is open' by moving the 'open' rule, but I don't see an 'open' rule in the list.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. So I need to reach the ball to win.

The ball is three steps left and three down. Let me see if I can get there without changing the rules.

From my starting position, I can move left three steps and down three steps. But are there walls blocking that path?

The walls are at one step right and various up and down positions. So moving left from my position, I can go left, but I need to check if there are walls to the left.

Wait, the walls are to the right, so moving left might be possible. Let me try:

Move left three steps, then down three steps. But I need to check if there are walls in that path.

Wait, the walls are at one step right and two up, one step right and one up, etc. So moving left from my position, I can go left without hitting walls, then down.

But when I move down, there are walls at one step right and one down, etc. So moving down three steps might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls, then left, then down.

Wait, moving up from my position, I can go up one step, then left, then down. Let me see:

Up one step, then left three steps, then down three steps. But I need to check if that path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up, then right, then up again to go around the wall, then left towards the ball.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving up first.

So, first action: move up.

Then, from there, I can move left or right.

Wait, but the wall is one step right and two up. So if I move up, then right, I can go around it.

So, move up, then right, then up again. Then, I can move left towards the ball.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I can move left first.

Wait, the key is one step left and one up. So if I move left and up, I can get the key, which might help me open the door.

So, perhaps the best course of action is to move left to get the key, then use it to open the door and reach the ball.

So, first, I need to move left and up to get the key.

But wait, moving left from my position, is there a wall? The wall is one step right and two up, so it's to the right, not blocking my left movement.

So, I can move left, then up to get the key.

So, first action: move left.

Then, from there, move up to get the key.

But I need to make sure that moving left is possible. Let me check the walls again.

The walls are at one step right and various positions, so moving left from my starting position should be possible.

So, I think the best first step is to move left to get closer to the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control the Baba character.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and two up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" ""you."" There's also a key one step up, which might be important later.

I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Right now, the ball is three steps to the left and three down. But to make it win, I might need to move the rule blocks to create a new rule. Since the current rule is ""ball is win,"" maybe I can change it or add another rule.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key first to unlock something. But how? The key is just one step up, so I can move up to get it. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""stop"" one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" it could make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. If I can get ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the exit as Baba. But the current rule is ""ball is win,"" so maybe I need to break that rule or create a new one.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is five steps to the right and two up. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to it, I can form ""ball is win,"" which is already active. Maybe I need to change it to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""baba"" rule to the left and down to create ""baba is win."" That way, when I reach the win condition, I can win as Baba. Let me see how to do that.

I need to move the ""baba"" rule four steps to the left and four down. The ""is"" is three steps to the left and four down, and ""you"" is two steps to the left and four down. So if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can form ""baba is you,"" which is already active. But I need to change it to ""baba is win.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is."" The ""win"" rule is seven steps to the right and two up. That's far away. Maybe I can move it closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move the ""ball"" rule to the left and down to where the ""baba"" rule is. If I can get ""ball is win"" to be next to ""baba is you,"" maybe I can combine them somehow.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can form ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition, so I can win by reaching the exit.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from its current position. The ""is"" block is six steps to the right and two up. I can move left to get closer. Let me plan the steps.

First, I need to move left to reach the ""is"" block. Then, move it down to where ""baba"" and ""win"" are. Wait, the ""win"" block is seven steps to the right and two up, which is far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" block closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the right to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. The ""baba"" rule is four steps to the left and four down. If I move it right, I can bring it closer.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule. If I can make ""ball is stop,"" then the ball can't move, but that might not help.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move it next to ""ball,"" I can make ""ball is stop,"" preventing it from moving. But I need to win, so maybe that's not useful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes me, and I can control it. But the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can't do that unless I change the rules.

Hmm, maybe I should try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block. Let me see: if I move the ""is"" block from six steps right and two up to the position of ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can form ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition.

So, I need to move the ""is"" block left. Let me count the steps. The ""is"" block is at (6,2). I need to move it to (4,4) where ""baba"" is. So, I need to move left four times and down two times. But I can only move one step at a time.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the layout again. The key is one step up, so maybe I should pick that up first. If I move up, I can get the key, which might unlock a door or something.

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Maybe I can proceed without it. Let me try to move the ""is"" block. I need to get to it, so I have to move right six times and up two times. That's a lot, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" block to the left. The ""win"" block is seven steps right and two up. If I move it left seven times, it would be at the starting position. Then, I can move it down to form ""baba is win.""

But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think again.

The current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" I need to change the win condition to myself. So, I need to create ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to ""baba.""

The ""baba"" rule is four steps left and four down. The ""is"" block is six steps right and two up. The ""win"" block is seven steps right and two up. So, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to the left and down.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the right. The ""baba"" rule is four steps left and four down. If I move it right four times, it would be at the starting position. Then, I can move it up to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

Wait, but moving the ""baba"" rule might not be possible because it's a rule block. I can only move objects or text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, I can move the ""baba"" rule if it's not stopped.

I think I can move the ""baba"" rule. So, let's try that. I need to move the ""baba"" rule four steps to the right. That would bring it to the starting position. Then, I can move it up to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

Once the ""baba"" rule is at the starting position, I can move it up two steps to where the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are. Then, I can arrange them to form ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block first. Let me try to move the ""is"" block from six steps right and two up to the left. I can move left six times to bring it to the starting position, then down four times to where ""baba"" is.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps. Maybe I can do it in smaller steps. Let me plan:

1. Move right six times to reach the ""is"" block at (6,2).
2. Move down two times to bring it to (6,0).
3. Then, move left six times to bring it to (0,0).
4. Then, move down four times to reach (0,-4), where ""baba"" is.

But that seems too long. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" block to the left. The ""win"" block is at (7,2). If I move it left seven times, it would be at (0,2). Then, I can move it down four times to (0,-2), where ""baba"" is.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the left. The ""ball"" rule is at (5,2). If I move it left five times, it would be at (0,2). Then, I can move it down to where ""baba"" is.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block first. Let me try to move the ""is"" block from (6,2) to the left. I can move left once to (5,2), which is where the ""ball"" rule is. Then, I can move it down to (5,1), and so on.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" block to the left. The ""win"" block is at (7,2). If I move it left seven times, it would be at (0,2). Then, I can move it down four times to (0,-2), where ""baba"" is.

Once there, I can arrange the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" blocks to form ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition, so I can win by reaching the exit.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""win"" block from (7,2) to (0,2) by moving left seven times.
2. Then, move it down four times to (0,-2), where ""baba"" is.
3. Then, move the ""is"" block from (6,2) to (0,2) by moving left six times.
4. Then, move it down four times to (0,-2).
5. Now, arrange them to form ""baba is win.""

But that seems like a lot of steps. Maybe I can do it more efficiently. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the right to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is at (4,-4). If I move it right four times, it would be at (8,-4). Then, I can move it up four times to (8,0). Then, move left to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

But that also seems complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block first. Let me try to move the ""is"" block from (6,2) to the left. I can move left once to (5,2), which is where the ""ball"" rule is. Then, I can move it down to (5,1), and so on.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should try to move the ""ball"" rule to the left. The ""ball"" rule is at (5,2). If I move it left five times, it would be at (0,2). Then, I can move it down to where ""baba"" is.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,-1). If I can move it next to a wall, it can stop the wall, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, maybe I can use the key. The key is at (0,1). If I move up once, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can unlock a door. The ""door"" rule is at (6,-2). If I have the key, I can open the door, but I'm not sure how that helps with the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to move certain blocks. But I'm not sure. Let me try to pick up the key first.

So, I'll move up once to get the key. Now, I have the key. Maybe I can use it to move a door or something. But I'm not sure yet.

Now, looking back at the rules, I still need to change the win condition. So, I need to create ""baba is win."" Let me try to move the ""is"" block from (6,2) to the left. I can move left six times to bring it to (0,2). Then, I can move it down four times to (0,-2), where ""baba"" is.

Once there, I can arrange the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" blocks. Wait, but the ""win"" block is at (7,2). I need to move it to (0,2) as well. So, I can move the ""win"" block left seven times to (0,2), then down four times to (0,-2).

Now, at (0,-2), I have ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win."" I can arrange them to form ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition, so I can win by reaching the exit.

So, the steps are:

1. Move up once to get the key.
2. Move the ""is"" block from (6,2) to (0,2) by moving left six times.
3. Move the ""win"" block from (7,2) to (0,2) by moving left seven times.
4. Move both ""is"" and ""win"" blocks down four times to (0,-2).
5. Arrange them to form ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks that way. Maybe I can only move one block at a time. So, I need to plan the order.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block first. Let me try:

1. Move up once to get the key.
2. Move right six times to reach the ""is"" block at (6,2).
3. Move down two times to (6,0).
4. Move left six times to (0,0).
5. Move down four times to (0,-4), where ""baba"" is.
6. Now, I have ""baba"" and ""is"" at (0,-4). I need to get ""win"" there as well.

So, I need to move the ""win"" block from (7,2) to (0,-4). That would require moving left seven times and down six times. That's a lot, but let's try:

7. Move right seven times to reach the ""win"" block at (7,2).
8. Move down six times to (7,-4).
9. Move left seven times to (0,-4).

Now, at (0,-4), I have ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win."" I can arrange them to form ""baba is win.""

But that seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the right to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is at (4,-4). If I move it right four times, it would be at (8,-4). Then, I can move it up four times to (8,0). Then, I can move it left to meet the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

But that also seems complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block first. Let me try to move the ""is"" block from (6,2) to the left. I can move left six times to bring it to (0,2). Then, I can move it down four times to (0,-2), where ""baba"" is.

Once there, I can arrange the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" blocks. Wait, but the ""win"" block is at (7,2). I need to move it to (0,2) as well. So, I can move the ""win"" block left seven times to (0,2), then down four times to (0,-2).

Now, at (0,-2), I have ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win."" I can arrange them to form ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition, so I can win by reaching the exit.

So, the steps are:

1. Move up once to get the key.
2. Move right six times to reach the ""is"" block at (6,2).
3. Move down two times to (6,0).
4. Move left six times to (0,0).
5. Move down four times to (0,-4), where ""baba"" is.
6. Now, I have ""baba"" and ""is"" at (0,-4). I need to get ""win"" there as well.
7. Move right seven times to reach the ""win"" block at (7,2).
8. Move down six times to (7,-4).
9. Move left seven times to (0,-4).

Now, at (0,-4), I have ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win."" I can arrange them to form ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""win"" block that way. Maybe I can only move one block at a time. So, I need to plan the order.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block first. Let me try:

1. Move up once to get the key.
2. Move right six times to reach the ""is"" block at (6,2).
3. Move down two times to (6,0).
4. Move left six times to (0,0).
5. Move down four times to (0,-4), where ""baba"" is.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step up. I remember that keys usually open doors, so maybe I need to get that key. But to get the key, I need to figure out how to move there. 

The key is one step up from my current position. So, I should move up to reach it. But wait, are there any walls or other obstacles in the way? Let me check the objects around me. There's a wall two steps to the right and two steps up. Hmm, that's not directly in my path if I move up. 

Also, there's a rule `stop` one step down. I don't want to step on that because it might stop me. So, moving up seems safe. Once I get the key, I can probably open the door, which is six steps to the right and two steps down. But first, I need the key.

So, the plan is to move up to get the key. That should be the first step. Let me make sure there's nothing else blocking that path. The walls are on the right and down, so moving up should be clear. 

I think moving up is the right action here. It gets me closer to the key, which is essential for progressing further in the level. Once I have the key, I can work on opening the door and maybe changing some rules to win the game.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win"" all to the right and up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps to the left, and an ""is"" rule two steps to the left. 

Wait, there's a key one step up. That might be important. I need to get the key to open a door maybe? But I don't see a door yet. Oh, there's a ""door"" rule six steps to the right and three steps down. So I might need to move towards that door.

The ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. So it's somewhere below me. There are walls all around, so I need to find a path. The ""stop"" rule is two steps down, which probably means I can't move through that area. 

Hmm, the ""baba"" rule is three steps to the left and five steps down, and ""you"" is one step to the left and five steps down. So maybe if I move those rules around, I can change what Baba is or what counts as a win.

I think I should start by moving towards the key. It's one step up, so I can go up. But wait, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Maybe I need to move that wall to get to the key. Or perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the wall passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the ball something else. If I can change ""ball is win"" to something else, maybe I can make the win condition easier. Or perhaps I can make myself into the ball to reach the win condition.

Wait, since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I would become the ball and could reach the win condition. How can I do that? I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is."" 

Looking at the positions, the ""ball"" rule is five steps to the right and one step up. The ""is"" rule is six steps to the right and one step up. The ""baba"" rule is three steps to the left and five steps down. So I need to move the ""ball"" rule closer to ""baba"" and ""is.""

Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule left and up to connect with ""baba"" and ""is."" But I can only move rules that aren't ""stop."" So I need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""ball."" If I can get ""baba is ball,"" then I can become the ball and reach the win condition.

Let me try to plan the steps. I need to move the ""is"" rule from six steps right and one step up to between ""baba"" and ""ball."" But that might take several moves. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule left towards ""baba.""

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is five steps right and one step up. If I move it left four times, it would be one step right and one step up. Then, moving it up once would bring it to the same level as ""baba."" But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule up to connect with ""is"" and ""ball."" The ""baba"" rule is three steps left and five steps down. That's quite far. Maybe it's easier to move the ""ball"" rule.

I think the key is to make ""baba is ball"" so I can become the ball and reach the win condition. So I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is."" Let me try to move the ""ball"" rule left four times to get it to one step right and one step up. Then, move it up once to align with ""baba.""

Wait, but ""baba"" is three steps left and five steps down. That's a long way. Maybe I should look for another approach. Perhaps I can make the ball the win condition and find a way to reach it.

The ball is two steps left and four steps down. There are walls around, so I might need to break through. Maybe if I can move the walls or change their properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key the win condition. If I can change the rule to ""key is win,"" then I can just pick up the key and win. How can I do that? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win.""

The ""key"" is one step up. The ""is"" rule is two steps left and one step up. So if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win."" But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is seven steps right and one step up. That's far. Maybe it's better to focus on making myself the ball.

Another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can make walls passable. The ""stop"" rule is two steps down. If I move it somewhere else, the walls might become passable. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to create a path. The ""door"" is six steps right and three steps down. If I can open the door, maybe I can reach the ball.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and I need to move towards the key or the ball. The walls are blocking me, but maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the walls passable.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would block movement. But I already have ""stop"" as a rule. Maybe I can change ""wall is something else.""

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So I'm Baba, and the ball is the win condition. I need to reach the ball. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. There are walls in the way, so I need to find a way to move through them or rearrange the rules to make the path clear.

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position so that the walls aren't stopping me. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls might become passable.

Alternatively, I can try to move the walls themselves. But I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So if the walls are ""stop,"" I can't move them. But if I can change their properties, maybe I can move them.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is three steps left. So if I can move that rule, I can change what walls are. Maybe if I make ""wall is push,"" I can push them. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. It's one step up. If I can get the key, maybe it will help me open a door or change a rule.

So, I'll try moving up to get the key. Let me see if that's possible. There's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. So if I move up, I might hit the wall. But maybe I can move the wall first.

Wait, I can't move walls if they're ""stop."" So I need to find a way to make them movable. Maybe by changing the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""wall is something else."" For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push them. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" so I can walk through them. But that might not be necessary. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is win,"" but that doesn't help me reach the ball.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule closer to ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""baba is ball."" That way, I can become the ball and reach the win condition.

So, the ""ball"" rule is five steps right and one step up. I need to move it left four times to get it to one step right and one step up. Then, move it up once to align with ""baba."" But ""baba"" is three steps left and five steps down, which is far. Maybe I can move ""baba"" up instead.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""ball."" The ""is"" rule is six steps right and one step up. If I move it left five times, it would be one step right and one step up. Then, moving it up once would align it with ""baba.""

Wait, but ""baba"" is five steps down. So maybe I need to move ""baba"" up. The ""baba"" rule is three steps left and five steps down. If I can move it up five times, it would be three steps left. Then, moving it right three times would bring it to my position. But that seems like a lot of moves.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule up to where ""baba"" is. But that's also a lot of steps.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the key again. It's one step up. If I can get the key, maybe it will help me open a door or change a rule.

So, I'll try moving up to get the key. Let me see if that's possible. There's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. So if I move up, I might hit the wall. But maybe I can move the wall first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""baba,"" ""is,"" ""you."" There's also a key one step up and a ball two steps to the left and four steps down. 

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since ""ball is win"" is already active, maybe I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But wait, the win condition is already set to the ball, so maybe I need to move the ball to a position where it can be collected or activated.

I see a key one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how? Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me check the layout again. The walls are positioned in a way that might block me, but I can move around them if possible.

I notice that the rule ""stop"" is two steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the movement rules. But I'm not sure yet. The door is six steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe that's a path I can take once I have the key.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. That's quite far. I need to figure out a path to get there. Let me plan my movements. Starting from my current position, I can move right twice and up once to get past the wall. Then, I can move down to reach the ball.

But I also need to consider the rules. If I can rearrange the rule blocks, maybe I can change the win condition or make the ball easier to reach. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach the win condition myself. But the current rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to get the ball to the win position.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball moveable by changing its properties. If I can make ""ball is push"" or something, I could push it into the win area. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Let me think about the key. If I pick up the key, maybe I can unlock a door. The door is six steps to the right and three steps down. If I can get to the door, maybe I can open it with the key and find a way to the ball.

Wait, but the key is only one step up. So I can move up once to get the key. That seems manageable. Once I have the key, I can go to the door. But the door is quite far. Let me map out the path.

From my starting position, moving up once gets me the key. Then, I need to move right six steps and down three steps to reach the door. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions. There's a wall two steps to the right and one step up, another two steps right, and others down. I might need to navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the environment. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make certain areas passable. But I'm not sure how that would help with getting the ball.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach the win condition myself. But the current rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to get the ball to the win position. Maybe I can move the ball's rule to change its properties.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. That's a bit tricky. Maybe I can move the ball by pushing it, but I don't have a push rule. Alternatively, if I can make the ball moveable by changing its rule.

Let me try to move the rule blocks. If I can move the ""ball"" rule to a different position, maybe I can change the active rules. For example, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""ball is win"" rule by moving the ""win"" rule block. If I can separate ""ball"" from ""win,"" then the win condition changes. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, the key is one step up. Let me try to get the key first. So, I'll move up once to pick up the key. Then, I can go to the door. But the door is six steps to the right and three steps down. Let me see if I can get there without hitting walls.

From the key's position, moving right six steps would take me past the walls. But there are walls two steps to the right and one step up, so I might need to go around. Maybe I can move down first to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls by changing their rules. If I can make ""wall is push,"" I could move them out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on getting the ball. If I can reach the ball, then I can win. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. Let me plan a path.

From my starting position, I can move left twice and down four times. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path. The walls are positioned at two steps right and various up and down positions, so maybe the left path is clear.

Wait, the wall is two steps to the right and one step up, so moving left might be possible. Let me try moving left twice and then down four times. But I need to make sure there are no walls in that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get the key, then go around the walls to reach the ball. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach the win condition. But the current rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to get the ball to the win position. Maybe I can move the ball's rule to change its properties.

Wait, the ball is two steps left and four steps down. Let me try to move there. So, I'll move left twice and then down four times. Let me see if that's possible without hitting walls.

From my starting position, moving left twice would take me past the walls on the right. Then, moving down four times should get me to the ball. Let me try that.

So, my plan is: move left twice, then down four times to reach the ball. Once I have the ball, I can win.

But wait, I also have the key one step up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something. Let me check.

If I move up once, I get the key. Then, I can go to the door. But the door is six steps right and three steps down. That seems far, but maybe it's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't needed, and I can just focus on getting the ball. Let me try moving left twice and down four times.

So, my first move is to move left twice. Let me do that.

Wait, but the walls are two steps to the right and one step up. So, moving left from my starting position, I should be able to go left without hitting walls. Let me confirm.

Yes, moving left twice should be possible. Then, moving down four times to reach the ball.

Once I have the ball, I can win because ""ball is win"" is active.

So, my actions would be: left, left, down, down, down, down.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. Let me check the walls again.

The walls are at two steps right and various up and down positions, so moving left and down should be clear.

Okay, I think that's the way to go. I'll move left twice and then down four times to reach the ball and win the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the right. I remember that keys usually open doors, so maybe I need to get the key to proceed. But first, I need to figure out how to move towards it.

The key is just one step to the right, so maybe I can move right to pick it up. But wait, are there any walls or other obstacles in the way? Let me check the objects. There's a wall three steps to the right and one step up, but that's not directly in my path. The key is only one step right, so I think I can move there without issues.

But I should also consider the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. There's a rule ""stop"" one step to the right and two steps down. I need to make sure I don't step on that unless I want to stop moving. But right now, I just want to get the key, so maybe moving right is the way to go.

Wait, there's also a door seven steps to the right and three steps down. Doors usually require a key to open, so once I have the key, I can go through the door. But first, I need to get the key.

So, my plan is to move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go towards the door. But before I do that, I should check if there are any other rules or objects that might affect my movement. For example, if there's a ""stop"" rule nearby, I might get stuck if I step on it.

Looking again, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and two steps down. That's not directly in my path if I just move right once. So, moving right should be safe. After picking up the key, I can then move towards the door, but I need to make sure I have a clear path.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange some rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make ""baba is push,"" I could push certain objects. But right now, the active rules don't include that, so I might not have that ability unless I move some rule blocks.

But since the key is right next to me, maybe it's better to just grab it first. Once I have the key, I can look for the door and see if I can open it. The door is seven steps to the right and three steps down, which is quite far. I need to make sure there's a path there without too many walls.

Wait, there are walls three steps to the right and various steps down. That might block my path. Maybe I need to break through the walls or find another way. But without the key, I can't open the door, so getting the key is the priority.

So, to summarize, I should move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can navigate towards the door and open it, which should lead me to the win condition, the ball. Alternatively, maybe the ball is behind the door, so I need the key to reach it.

Another thought: since ""ball is win,"" maybe I can make the ball move towards me or change the rules so that I can become the ball. But that might be more complicated. For now, focusing on getting the key seems like the straightforward approach.

I should also check if there are any other rule blocks I can use. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" blocks to create new rules, that might help. But since I'm just starting, it's better to keep it simple and get the key first.

So, the immediate action is to move right to pick up the key. That should set me up for the next steps towards the door and the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you."" There's also a key one step up, and the ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. 

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The ball is somewhere down, so maybe I need to get it to the win condition. But wait, the win condition is already set to the ball, so maybe I just need to reach the ball. 

But there are walls in the way. Let me see the layout. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. There's a ""stop"" rule two steps down, which probably makes the walls immovable. So I can't move through them. 

I also notice there's a key one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how does that help? If I can move the key, maybe I can change a rule. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls might become movable. 

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, then the walls won't be stopped anymore. That could open up paths. So maybe I should move towards the ""stop"" rule. Let me see where it is: two steps down. So from my current position, I need to go down twice to reach it. 

But before that, I need to get to the key. The key is one step up, so I should move up first. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to change the rules. Alternatively, maybe moving the key isn't necessary if I can manipulate the rules directly. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""ball"" rule to change the win condition. But since ""ball is win"" is already active, maybe I just need to get the ball to the win area. 

Wait, the ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. So from my current position, I need to move left twice and down four times. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the path. 

Looking at the walls: two steps to the right and one step up, then two steps to the right, and so on. It seems like the walls form a barrier on the right side. Maybe I can go around them on the left. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving up first to get the key, then see what options I have. So, moving up once would get me the key. Then, perhaps I can use the key to move other rule blocks. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules to change my properties. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and maybe change more rules. 

Wait, but I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think again. The key is one step up, so moving up would get me the key. Then, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule by picking it up and moving it elsewhere, making the walls movable. 

So, step by step: move up to get the key, then move down twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Once I have the ""stop"" rule, I can move it somewhere else, which would make the walls no longer stop, allowing me to move through them. 

Once the walls are passable, I can move left and down to reach the ball. Then, since ""ball is win,"" touching the ball would win the level. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to change the win condition, but that might complicate things. It's probably better to focus on getting to the ball. 

So, the plan is: move up to get the key, then move down twice to get the ""stop"" rule, move it somewhere else, then move through the walls to reach the ball. 

But wait, do I need the key to move the ""stop"" rule? Or can I just move the ""stop"" rule without it? I think in Baba Is You, you can pick up rule blocks and move them regardless of keys, as long as they're not stopped. 

So maybe I don't need the key. I can just move towards the ""stop"" rule directly. Let me see: from my current position, moving down twice would get me to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, making the walls movable. 

Once the walls are movable, I can go around them and reach the ball. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position, but that might not be necessary since ""ball is win"" is already active. 

So, the immediate action should be to move down to reach the ""stop"" rule and change it. But wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. So, I need to move down twice. 

But in the previous step, I was at a position where moving up got me the key. Maybe I should prioritize that. 

Wait, perhaps the key is needed to unlock something else. Maybe without the key, I can't proceed. So, moving up first to get the key is essential. 

Once I have the key, I can use it to move other rule blocks. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule to change the walls' properties. 

So, the first action should be to move up to get the key. Then, from there, move down twice to get the ""stop"" rule. 

But in the current observation, the key is one step up, so moving up once would get it. Then, moving down twice from there would take me to the ""stop"" rule. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move left or right to find a better path. But the walls seem to be on the right, so moving left might be better. 

Wait, the ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. So, after getting the key and moving the ""stop"" rule, I can go left and down to reach the ball. 

So, the immediate action is to move up to get the key. Then, use the key to manipulate the rules. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I can just move down to the ""stop"" rule without the key. Let me think: if I move down twice, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it, making the walls passable. 

So, perhaps the key isn't necessary for this step. Maybe it's needed for something else later. 

In that case, moving down twice to get the ""stop"" rule is the way to go. 

Wait, but in the observation, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. So, from my current position, moving down twice would get me there. 

So, the action should be to move down twice. But the available actions are only one step at a time. So, I need to choose ""down"" as the action. 

Wait, but the user's previous actions were ""up,"" ""right,"" ""down,"" ""left,"" and ""idle."" So, each action is a single step. 

So, to move down twice, I need to choose ""down"" twice. But in this case, the user is asking for a single action. 

Wait, no, the user is asking for one action in the response. So, I need to choose the next step. 

So, from my current position, the best next step is to move down to start heading towards the ""stop"" rule. 

Alternatively, moving up to get the key might be better. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the map. 

The player (Baba) is at the origin. The key is one step up. The ""stop"" rule is two steps down. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. 

So, the path to the ball is blocked by walls. To get past the walls, I need to make them movable by moving the ""stop"" rule. 

So, the plan is: move down twice to get the ""stop"" rule, move it somewhere else, then move through the walls to reach the ball. 

But to do that, I need to move down twice. So, the first action is ""down."" 

Wait, but the key is up. Maybe I need the key for something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is not necessary for this level. Maybe I can proceed without it. 

In that case, moving down is the way to go. 

So, the action is ""down.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step up. I remember that keys usually open doors, so maybe I need to get that key to proceed. But first, I need to figure out how to move around.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I see a rule ""stop"" one step down, which probably means that if I step there, I can't move further. So I need to avoid that or find a way to change it.

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. If I can reach the ball, I can win, but I need to get past any obstacles. The door is six steps to the right and two steps down, so maybe I need to open that with the key.

I think the strategy should be to move towards the key first. Since I'm Baba, I can move freely unless there are walls or stop rules in my way. Let me check the path to the key. It's one step up, so I can move up once to get it.

Wait, but I also need to consider the rules. If I can rearrange the rules, maybe I can change the win condition or make something else movable. For example, if I can make the wall movable, I can break through it.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""wall"" rule three steps to the left and one step up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Alternatively, I can focus on getting the key first. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it, which might lead me closer to the ball. So, moving up to get the key seems like a good first step.

I should also check if moving up is possible without hitting any walls or stop rules. The observation shows that moving up from my current position is clear, so I can safely move up to get the key.

After getting the key, I can then move towards the door. The door is six steps to the right and two steps down, so I'll need to navigate around any walls. Maybe after opening the door, I can reach the ball more easily.

Alternatively, if the door is blocked by walls, I might need to change the rules to make the walls movable. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push,"" I can push them out of the way.

But for now, the immediate goal is to get the key. So moving up is the first action I should take.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""key,"" and so on. The key is one step up, which might be important. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps down, which probably means that if I can move that, I can change what stops movement.

The ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. I need to get to the ball to win. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to figure out how to move them or change the rules to get past them.

I notice that the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure how to use that yet. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the walls movable or change their properties.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key first. If I can get the key, perhaps it can open a door or something. But I don't see a door in the current observation. Hmm.

Let me think about the rules. ""ball is win"" means that when I reach the ball, I win. ""baba is you"" means I'm Baba. So, I need to move Baba to the ball. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can change the rules so that the walls become passable or move them out of the way.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""wall"" is three steps to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" rule block.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls not stop me. So, if I move the ""stop"" rule block away from the walls, the walls won't stop me anymore. That could be a way to pass through them.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule block? I need to be able to move it, which means it shouldn't be defined as ""stop"" itself. Since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but the ""stop"" rule is separate. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block by pushing it with another object or by changing the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by rearranging the existing rule blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks, I could make a new rule like ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key first. If I move up, I can get the key. Then, perhaps the key can be used to open a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door in the current observation. Maybe the key is for something else.

Let me try to visualize the map. There's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then, the rule blocks are spread out to the right and left. The ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. So, to get to the ball, I need to move left and down, but walls are in the way.

If I can make the walls not stop me, I can pass through them. So, maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule block. If I can move it away, the walls won't stop me anymore. But how do I move it? I need to be able to move it, which means it shouldn't be defined as ""stop."" Since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but the ""stop"" rule is separate.

Wait, maybe I can push the ""stop"" rule block by moving into it. If I move into the ""stop"" rule block, maybe I can push it to a new location. But I'm not sure if that's allowed. Let me try moving up to get the key first, then see if I can use it to move the ""stop"" rule.

So, my plan is: move up to get the key, then use the key to move the ""stop"" rule block. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the ball.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule block to change the properties of the walls. If I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls out of the way.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is three steps to the left. If I can move that, I could create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""wall"" block next to ""is push,"" it would make ""wall is push."" That would allow me to push the walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule block in the current observation. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the walls won't stop me anymore. That seems more straightforward.

So, I think the best course of action is to move up to get the key, then use the key to move the ""stop"" rule block. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the ball.

But wait, I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Maybe I can just move the ""stop"" rule block without the key. Let me try moving down to get closer to the ""stop"" rule block.

If I move down two steps, I can reach the ""stop"" rule block. Then, I can move it to a different location, perhaps to the left or right, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once that's done, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a position where it's not associated with the walls anymore. That way, the walls won't have the ""stop"" property, and I can pass through them.

I think moving the ""stop"" rule block is the key here. So, I'll move down two steps to reach it, then move it to a new location. Once that's done, I can move through the walls to reach the ball.

But I need to make sure I'm not moving into a wall myself. Since the walls are two steps to the right and one step up, I need to plan my path carefully. Maybe I can move left first to avoid the walls, then move down to get the ""stop"" rule block.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I should get the key first to see if it helps. If I move up, I can get the key, then use it to move the ""stop"" rule block. But I'm not sure if the key is necessary for that.

Alternatively, I can ignore the key for now and focus on moving the ""stop"" rule block. If I can move it without the key, that would be faster. Let me try moving down two steps to reach the ""stop"" rule block.

Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule block, I can move it to a new location. For example, I can move it to the left or right, breaking the association with the walls. That should make the walls passable.

After moving the ""stop"" rule block, I can then move through the walls to reach the ball. That should allow me to win the level.

So, my plan is: move down two steps to reach the ""stop"" rule block, then move it to a new location to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once that's done, move through the walls to reach the ball and win.

I think that's the best approach. Let's try it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and two steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""key,"" and so on. The key is one step up, which might be important. There's also a ball two steps to the left and three steps down, which is our win condition. 

I need to figure out how to get to the ball. The walls are in the way, so maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make the walls stop being walls, I can pass through them. 

The rule blocks are arranged in a line: ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks, I might be able to create a new rule. Maybe I can make ""wall is stop"" so that the walls become stoppers, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" I could unlock the door, but I don't see a door nearby. 

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to change the win condition. 

I think the key is to manipulate the rules so that I can move through the walls. If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through them. But how? I need to move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks to form that rule. 

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" block is two steps to the left and one step up. The ""you"" block is one step to the left and four steps down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""you,"" I can create ""wall is you."" That would make the walls passable. 

So, I need to move the ""is"" block from its current position to between ""wall"" and ""you."" Let me see the steps. The ""wall"" rule is three steps to the left and one step up. The ""is"" is two steps to the left and one step up. The ""you"" is one step to the left and four steps down. 

I think I can move the ""is"" block down to where ""you"" is. But how? I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me try moving down to get closer to the ""is"" block. 

Wait, the ""is"" block is two steps to the left and one step up. If I move left twice and up once, I can reach it. But there are walls in the way. Hmm, maybe I need to break the walls first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition, and I can pick it up. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. 

I think the best bet is to make the walls passable. So, I need to create ""wall is you."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""you."" Let me plan the steps. 

First, I need to move the ""is"" block from its current position (two steps left, one step up) to where ""wall"" is (three steps left, one step up). Then, I can move the ""you"" block up to join them. 

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I can only move it if it's not a stop. Right now, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can make the ""is"" block movable. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move it somewhere else, the ""is"" block won't be stopped anymore. So, I can move the ""stop"" rule down two steps to make space. 

Let me try that. I'll move down twice to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it further down. Once the ""stop"" is moved, the ""is"" block becomes movable. 

After moving the ""stop"" rule, I can go back up and move the ""is"" block to the left to join ""wall."" Then, I can move the ""you"" block up to complete the rule ""wall is you."" 

Once that rule is active, the walls become passable, and I can move through them to reach the ball. 

So, the steps are:
1. Move down to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down to make space.
3. Move the ""is"" block to the left to join ""wall.""
4. Move the ""you"" block up to complete the rule.
5. Walk through the walls to reach the ball.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll execute the first step by moving down.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and three steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""key,"" and so on. The key is two steps up, which might be important. There's also a door six steps to the right and one step down, which probably needs the key to open. 

The ball is two steps to the left and two steps down. I need to get to the ball to win. But there are walls in the way. The rule ""stop"" is one step down, which might be blocking movement. 

I think I need to move towards the ball. Let me check the path. If I go left, there's a wall two steps to the right and three steps up, but I'm not sure how that affects me. Maybe I can move around it. 

Wait, the key is two steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door, which could lead to the ball. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to change the win condition or make the walls passable. 

Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls not stop me. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" to move the walls. 

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me try moving towards the ball. If I go left, I might get closer. Alternatively, moving up could help me reach the key. 

Hmm, maybe I should first try to get the key. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might be a shortcut. So, I'll move up two steps to get the key. 

Wait, but moving up two steps might take me into a wall. Let me check the map again. The wall is two steps to the right and three steps up, so if I'm at the starting position, moving up two steps would take me to where the key is, but there's a wall in the way. 

Maybe I need to move around the wall. Let me try moving left first. If I go left, I can avoid the wall and then move up. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make the walls passable. 

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. 

Wait, the key is two steps up, and the wall is two steps to the right and three steps up. So, if I move up two steps, I might be able to get the key without hitting the wall. 

Let me try that. I'll move up two steps to get the key. 

But wait, the wall is in the way. Maybe I need to move left first to avoid the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall. If I can make the wall movable, I can push it out of the way. 

But I don't know how to do that yet. Maybe I should try moving left to get around the wall. 

So, I'll move left once, then up two steps to get the key. 

Wait, but moving left once might take me to where the rule blocks are. Let me check. 

The rule blocks are spread out, but moving left once should be safe. 

Okay, I'll move left once, then up two steps to get the key. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try a different path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls not stop me. 

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move it, I might be able to change the rules. 

But I'm not sure how to move it. Maybe I need to push it with Baba. 

But I don't know if that's possible. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball directly. 

The ball is two steps to the left and two steps down. So, if I move left twice and down twice, I should reach it. 

But there might be walls in the way. Let me check. 

The wall is two steps to the right and three steps up, so moving left and down might avoid it. 

Alternatively, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up, which might block my path. 

Wait, the wall is two steps to the right and one step up, so if I'm moving left, I should be okay. 

Let me try moving left twice and down twice to reach the ball. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should try moving left once, then up, then left again, and then down. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get the key, then use it to open the door. 

I think getting the key might be the better approach because it could unlock the door, which might lead to the ball. 

So, I'll try moving up two steps to get the key. 

But I'm still not sure about the walls. Maybe I should try moving left first to avoid any walls. 

Wait, the wall is two steps to the right and three steps up, so if I move left, I should be able to avoid it. 

Okay, I'll move left once, then up two steps to get the key. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should try moving up first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. 

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. 

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball directly. 

So, I'll move left twice and down twice to reach the ball. 

But I'm not sure if that's possible due to the walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls. If I can make the walls movable, I can push them out of the way. 

But I don't know how to do that yet. 

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is probably making the walls immovable. If I can change that rule, I might be able to move through them. 

But I don't know how to change the rules yet. 

Maybe I should try moving the rule blocks. 

The rule `wall` is three steps to the left and two steps up. If I can move it, I might be able to change the rules. 

But I'm not sure how to do that. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. 

Wait, the key is two steps up. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which is six steps to the right and one step down. 

So, maybe I should get the key first, then go to the door. 

But I'm not sure how to get to the key without hitting walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key. 

But I don't know how to do that. 

Wait, the key is two steps up. If I move up two steps, I should reach it. 

But there's a wall in the way. 

Maybe I can move the wall. 

But I don't know how. 

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving left first to avoid the wall, then up. 

So, I'll move left once, then up two steps to get the key. 

But I'm not sure if that works. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first, then left. 

Wait, moving up first might take me into the wall. 

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving left once, then up two steps. 

Okay, I'll try that. 

So, my plan is: move left once, then up two steps to get the key. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first, then left. 

Wait, moving up first might take me into the wall. 

Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should try moving left once, then up two steps. 

Okay, I'll try that. 

So, I'll move left once, then up two steps to get the key. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move up two steps directly. 

But I'm worried about the wall. 

Hmm, I think I'll try moving left once, then up two steps. 

Okay, let's do that. 

So, first, I'll move left once. 

Then, I'll move up two steps to get the key. 

Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it. 

Then, I can go to the ball and win the level. 

I think that's the best plan. 

So, my first action is to move left once. 

Wait, but the wall is two steps to the right and three steps up. So, moving left once should be safe. 

Yes, I think that's the right move. 

So, I'll choose the left action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and three steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is six steps right and three up, ""is"" is seven right and three up, ""win"" is eight right and three up. There's also a ""wall"" rule two left and two up, and an ""is"" rule one left and two up. The key is one right and two up. 

Further down, there's a wall three right and two up, another three right and one up, and just three right. The ""stop"" rule is one right and one down. Then, a wall three right and one down, a ""door"" rule seven right and one down. The ball is one left and two down. There's a wall three right and two down, a ""baba"" rule two left and three down, an ""is"" rule one left and three down, a ""you"" rule three down, and a wall three right and three down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and rearrange the rule blocks. The key is nearby, so maybe I need to pick it up to open a door? But the door is seven right and one down. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one right and one down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what stops movement. But I'm not sure. The ball is one left and two down. If I can get the ball to the win condition, that might work. 

I think I should move towards the ball. Let me see, the ball is one left and two down from my current position. So, I need to go left once and down twice. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking me. 

Looking at the walls, there are walls three right and three up, three right and two up, three right and one up, three right, three right and one down, three right and two down, three right and three down. So, the path to the left and down seems clear except for the walls on the right side. 

Wait, the key is one right and two up. Maybe I need to pick up the key first to unlock something. If I move right once and up twice, I can get the key. Then, perhaps I can use it to open the door, which is seven right and one down. 

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. The main goal is to make the ball the win condition. Since ""ball is win"" is already active, maybe I just need to get the ball to the win position. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make myself the ball or something else. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""you,"" that might change things. 

Let me try moving towards the ball. So, I'll go left once and down twice. That should get me to the ball. Once I'm there, maybe I can push it or something. 

Wait, but can I move the ball? The active rules don't say anything about the ball being movable. It's just the win condition. So, maybe I need to change the rules to make the ball movable. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can define what stops movement. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls will stop movement. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is push"" to allow pushing objects. But I don't see a ""push"" rule in the objects. 

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on getting the key first. If I move right once and up twice, I can get the key. Then, maybe I can use it to open the door, which might lead to the ball or another rule block. 

But I'm not sure. The door is seven right and one down, which is quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Wait, the ball is one left and two down. If I can get there, maybe I can pick it up or something. But without the key, I might not be able to proceed. 

I think I'll try moving towards the key first. So, I'll go right once and up twice. That should get me the key. Once I have the key, I can maybe open the door and reach the ball. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rule blocks to change the win condition. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach the win condition myself. But the current rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to make the ball reach the win condition. 

Wait, the win condition is already the ball. So, maybe I just need to get the ball to the win position. But how? 

I think I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But since the ball is the win condition, maybe I just need to be near it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is you,"" making the ball controllable. Then, I can move it to the win position. 

But I don't see a ""you"" rule near the ball. The ""you"" rule is three steps down. So, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ball to make it ""ball is you."" 

To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is three steps down. So, I'll go down three times to reach it. Then, I can move it next to the ball. 

Wait, but moving rule blocks requires that they are not stopped by ""stop"" rules. I need to make sure I can move them. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""you"" to make ""ball is you."" That would make the ball controllable. 

The ""ball"" rule is six steps right and three up. That's quite far. Maybe it's better to move the ""you"" rule. 

I think I'll try moving the ""you"" rule. So, I'll go down three times to reach it. Then, I'll move it left or right to be next to the ball. 

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe there's a simpler way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can just move towards the ball and see what happens. If I can't move it, then I'll try changing the rules. 

So, I'll go left once and down twice to reach the ball. Let's see if that works.

Hmm, the key is probably important. Maybe I need to pick it up to open a door or something. The door rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, I need to get to the door, but it's pretty far to the right. 

The ball is 2 steps down. So, if I can get the ball to the door, maybe that will trigger the win condition. But how do I move the ball? Since ""ball is win,"" maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the ball moveable or change its properties.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe the ball can move. Or perhaps I can change the rules to make the ball pushable. 

I'm also seeing that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can get ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""you,"" that might change my properties. 

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get to the key. It's 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, I should move right twice and up twice. But wait, are there any walls blocking me? The wall is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so maybe I can go around it.

Once I have the key, I can probably open the door. The door is 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. That's a long way. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move faster or make the ball move towards the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the one that triggers the win condition by moving it to the door. Since ""ball is win,"" if I can get the ball to the door, that might end the level.

I should also consider the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe the ball can move on its own or be pushed. Or perhaps I can change the rule to something else, like ""ball is push,"" which would let me push it.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I would be controlling the ball, which might make it easier to move it to the win condition. But I need to see if that's possible with the rule blocks available.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Move to the key: right twice, up twice.
2. Pick up the key.
3. Move towards the door, which is far to the right.
4. Use the key to open the door.
5. Once the door is open, get the ball to the door to trigger the win.

But I'm not sure if the door requires the key to be used, or if just moving the key next to the door is enough. Also, I need to make sure that the ball can reach the door once I'm there.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball move towards the door. For example, if I can make ""ball is move,"" then the ball can be moved, and I can push it to the door.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is in the way. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe the ball can move. Or perhaps I can change the rule to ""ball is not stop,"" allowing it to move.

I think the key is to first get the key, then figure out how to move the ball to the door. Let me try moving right twice and up twice to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""key,"" and so on. It seems like the rules are spread out, and I need to move them around to change the game's rules.

I notice that the key is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to open a door? There's a rule ""door"" 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, perhaps the door is somewhere on the right side, and I need the key to open it.

But wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, if I can change the rules, maybe I can make something else the win condition or change what I am. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key and use it to open the door.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""baba"" is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down, ""is"" is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, and ""you"" is 3 steps down. So, if I can move these around, I might be able to create a new rule like ""baba is key.""

But how do I move them? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" I see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So, I need to avoid that.

Let me plan my moves. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to get to the rule blocks to rearrange them. Maybe I should move right to get closer to the ""ball"" and ""win"" rules. If I move right, I can start building a new rule.

Wait, but moving right might take me closer to the wall. I need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Let me check the walls: there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, another 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and so on. So, moving right might be blocked by walls. Maybe I should move up first to get around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to get to the ""stop"" rule and then move the ""stop"" somewhere else, but that might complicate things. I'm not sure.

Another idea: if I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes me, and I can reach the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ball is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can create ""ball is you."" But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba"" to make ""key is baba,"" which would let me pick up the key as Baba.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and I need to move towards the rule blocks. Maybe I should move right to get closer to the ""ball"" and ""win"" rules. If I move right, I can start building a new rule.

Wait, but moving right might take me into a wall. Let me check: the wall is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I move right, I might not hit the wall immediately. Maybe I can move right a few times and then up or down to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to get to the ""ball"" rule. If I move up, I can start rearranging the rules there.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I should move right first to get closer.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get closer to the rule blocks so I can start rearranging them to create a new rule that helps me win the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and three steps up.

More walls are at two right and two down, three down, and four down. The ""baba"" rule is three left and three down, ""is"" is two left and three down, ""you"" is one left and three down. Finally, a wall is two right and three down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The ball is two left and two down from me. I need to get to the ball to win. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball moveable or change what counts as a win.

Wait, the key is two steps up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door rule is six right and one down. If I can get to the door, maybe I can open it to reach the ball.

But how do I get past the walls? The ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. Alternatively, if I can break the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to move through walls.

Let me think about the movement. I'm at the starting position. The ball is two left and two down. So to get to the ball, I need to move left twice and down twice. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position so that the walls don't block me.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""you,"" I might change my properties. Or maybe move the ""ball"" rule to make the ball something else.

Wait, the key is two up. If I move up twice, I can pick up the key. Then, with the key, I can open the door. The door is six right and one down. So after picking up the key, I can go right six steps and down one to open the door. Then, maybe the door will lead me to the ball.

But how do I get to the door? There are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls won't stop me.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls into something else. If I can change the ""wall"" rule, I might be able to make them into something that doesn't block movement.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is three left and two up. If I move that rule, maybe I can change what walls are. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, but that might not help. Or ""wall is stop,"" which is already the case.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. If I move up twice, I can pick up the key. Then, I can go to the door. Let me try that.

So, my first move should be up twice to get the key. Then, I can go right six steps and down one to open the door. Once the door is open, I can go through and reach the ball to win.

Wait, but moving up twice might not be possible if there are walls. Let me check the map again. The key is two up, so I need to move up twice. Are there walls blocking that path? The wall is two right and three up, so maybe not directly in my way. I think I can move up twice to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door. The door is six right and one down. So from my current position, I need to move right six steps and down one. That should open the door, and then I can proceed to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make the ball moveable. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it towards the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So the ball is the win condition, and I'm Baba. I just need to reach the ball. So maybe I don't need to change any rules. I just need to find a path to the ball.

But the ball is two left and two down. There are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I can walk through the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties of the walls. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, but that might not help. Or ""wall is win,"" but that's not useful.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. The available rules are ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you.""

Hmm, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""something else."" For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is move,"" but I don't see a ""move"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to open the door, which might give me access to the ball. So let's focus on that. I need to get the key first.

So, I'll move up twice to get the key. Then, I'll go right six steps and down one to open the door. Once the door is open, I can go through and reach the ball.

But wait, moving right six steps from my current position might take me past the door. Let me visualize the map. The door is six right and one down. So from my starting position, moving right six steps would take me to the door's column, then down one step to open it.

Once the door is open, I can go through and find the ball. The ball is two left and two down from my starting position, but maybe after opening the door, the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe after opening the door, I can move left and down to reach the ball.

I think the best course of action is to move up twice to get the key, then move right six steps and down one to open the door, and then proceed to the ball.

But let me check if there are any walls blocking my path to the key. The wall is two right and three up, so moving up twice should be clear. Then, moving right six steps might require going around walls, but with the key, maybe the door opens a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I can walk through the walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move it up or left, maybe the walls won't stop me. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to the left, then the walls might not have the stop property anymore.

So, maybe I should first move the ""stop"" rule to the left, making walls passable, then move to the ball.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it next to another rule to change its property. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""is"" and ""something else,"" I can change what stops movement.

Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, the walls might no longer stop me.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move it up, maybe the walls won't have the stop property anymore.

So, perhaps I should move down once to get to the ""stop"" rule, then move it up to change its property.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to just go for the key and door route.

I think I'll try moving up twice to get the key, then right six and down one to open the door, then proceed to the ball.

So, my first action should be up twice. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I'll start with up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step up. I remember that keys are usually used to open doors, so that might be important. There's also a door rule six steps to the right and two steps down. So, maybe I need to get to the door and use the key to open it.

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. Since the ball is the win condition, I probably need to get it to the door or somewhere else to trigger the win. But first, I need to figure out how to move around.

I see a ""stop"" rule two steps down. That means if I move there, I can't go further. So I need to avoid that or find a way to change the rules to move past it. Maybe by rearranging the text blocks.

The wall is two steps to the right and two steps up. Walls are usually obstacles, so I can't move through them. But maybe if I change the rules, I can make walls passable or something else.

I also notice that there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you."" These can be moved to create new rules. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can change what Baba is. Maybe making Baba into something else to bypass walls or stop.

Wait, the key is one step up. If I can get to the key, I can open the door. The door is six steps to the right and two steps down. So I need to move right six times and down two times from my current position. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the path.

From my current position, moving right two steps takes me to a wall. So I can't go that way. Maybe I need to go up first. If I move up two steps, I can get past the wall and then move right. But I have to be careful not to hit the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make walls stop me, but that might not help. Or maybe make walls into something else.

Wait, if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Move up to avoid the wall.
2. Move right to get to the key.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Get the ball to the door to win.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I need to create a new rule to make the ball moveable or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" making the ball into me, so I can control it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. If I can get there, maybe I can push it or something. But I'm blocked by walls.

Hmm, maybe I need to break the rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I can pass through where it was. Or maybe make the walls into something else.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try moving up first to see if that helps. If I move up, I can avoid the wall and then move right. Let's try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""baba,"" ""is,"" ""you."" There's also a key one step up and a ball two steps to the left and four steps down. 

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since ""ball is win"" is already active, maybe I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But wait, the win condition is the ball itself, so perhaps I need to move the ball to a position where it can trigger the win.

I see a door six steps to the right and three steps down. Doors usually require a key to open. There's a key one step up, so maybe I need to get the key first. But how? The key is one step up from my current position. If I move up, I can pick up the key. 

Once I have the key, I can go to the door. The door is six steps to the right and three steps down. That seems like a long way. But maybe there's a shortcut or a way to change the rules to make movement easier. 

Wait, there are rule blocks that I can move. If I can rearrange them, I might be able to change the rules to my advantage. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop,"" then I can't move, which isn't helpful. But if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that might prevent walls from stopping me. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win,"" then the door becomes the win condition, but I already have ""ball is win."" Maybe I need to combine these somehow. 

Let me think about the ball. The ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. If I can move the ball to the door, which is six steps to the right and three steps down, that might trigger the win. But how do I move the ball? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can push the ball if it's adjacent. 

But the ball is quite far down. Maybe I need to move the rule blocks to create a path or change the rules so that the ball can move on its own. For example, if I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it. Or maybe ""ball is move"" so it moves automatically. 

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""ball,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" together. If I can move the ""win"" block next to the ""ball"" and ""is,"" I can form ""ball is win,"" which is already active. Maybe I need to break that rule or create a new one. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" but that might not help since I already need to win by getting the ball. 

Wait, the key is one step up. If I move up, I can pick up the key. Then, I can go to the door. But the door is six steps to the right and three steps down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move right multiple times and then down. 

But there are walls in the way. The walls are two steps to the right and one step up, and other positions. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" block. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then walls won't stop me. The ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe I can pass through the walls. 

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. If I move up, I can get the key. Then, I can go to the door. Once I open the door, maybe the ball can come through, and I can push it to the win condition. 

Wait, but the ball is already the win condition. So if I can get the ball to the exit, that would win. But the exit is the door, which requires the key. So maybe I need to get the key, open the door, and then push the ball through the door to win. 

But how do I push the ball? I need to be adjacent to it. The ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. So I need to move left twice and down four times to reach it. But there are walls in the way. 

Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" block. Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then walls won't stop me. 

The ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I can move it somewhere else, like next to a wall, then that wall won't stop me. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make the door open without the key. But I don't see a way to do that. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving up to get the key first. Let me try that. 

So, I'll move up to pick up the key. Then, I can go right six steps and down three steps to reach the door. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around them. 

Wait, the walls are two steps to the right and one step up, and other positions. If I move right two steps, I hit a wall. But if I move up first, I can get the key and then move right. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to create a path. For example, if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to form a new rule, like ""door is win,"" then opening the door would win the level. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key and then the ball. 

So, my plan is: move up to get the key, then move right and down to the door, open it, and then push the ball through to win. 

But I need to make sure I can move through the walls. Maybe after getting the key, I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls not stop me. 

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is three steps to the left. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. 

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving up to get the key and see what happens. 

So, I'll choose the ""up"" action to move towards the key.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around to rearrange the rules.

Wait, the key is one step down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how? I'm Baba, so I can move to the key. Let me try moving down to get the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can open a door or something else.

Looking further down, there's a ""stop"" rule four steps down. If I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can prevent something from stopping me. Or perhaps I can create a new rule by moving ""stop"" next to another word.

There's also a ""door"" rule six steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I need to open that door to reach the ball. But to open the door, I might need the key. So first, I should get the key.

So, my plan is: move down to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it. Then, I can reach the ball, which is the win condition. 

But wait, how do I move? The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. I need to choose one. Since the key is one step down, I should move down to get it.

Let me try moving down. That should get me closer to the key. Once I have the key, I can proceed to the door and win the level by reaching the ball.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and one up, ""is"" is six steps right and one up, ""win"" is seven steps right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps left, an ""is"" rule two steps left, and a wall two steps right. 

Further down, there's a ""stop"" rule three steps down, walls at various positions, a ""door"" rule six steps right and three down, a ball two steps left and four down, and some more rules related to Baba and you. 

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around to rearrange the rules. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" But wait, that's already the active rule. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to create a new rule. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""you,"" that would make me Baba, which I already am. Maybe I need to change the win condition. 

Wait, the ball is two steps left and four down. If I can get to the ball, maybe I can push it or something. But I'm not sure how movement works here. 

Let me think about the layout. The ball is at a lower position, and there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I need to break through the walls by changing their properties. If I can make a wall into something else, like a door, I can pass through. 

Looking at the ""door"" rule, it's six steps right and three down. If I can move the ""door"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can turn that wall into a door. Then I can walk through it. 

So, my plan is to move towards the ""door"" rule and position it next to a wall. Once that wall becomes a door, I can go through it to reach the ball. 

But how do I move the ""door"" rule? I need to be next to it and then move it. Let me check where I am. I'm Baba, so I'm at the starting position. The ""door"" rule is six steps right and three down. That's quite far. 

Maybe I can move right several times to get closer. Let me try moving right a few steps to reach the ""door"" rule. Once I'm next to it, I can move it to a wall's position. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing blocks. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe that wall becomes stoppable, but I'm not sure if that helps. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I can move it next to a wall, perhaps that wall will stop me, but I need to pass through, so that might not be useful. 

I think the best approach is to focus on the ""door"" rule. If I can position it next to a wall, I can turn that wall into a door. Then, I can go through it to reach the ball. 

So, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""door"" rule. Let me move right six times to reach it. Once there, I can move it to a wall's position. 

But wait, moving six steps right might take me out of the map. Let me check the map boundaries. The farthest right is seven steps, so six steps right should be okay. 

After moving right six times, I'm next to the ""door"" rule. Now, I can move it down three steps to position it next to a wall. That way, the wall becomes a door, and I can pass through. 

Once the wall is a door, I can move down to reach the ball. Then, since the ball is the win condition, touching it should complete the level. 

So, my actions will be: move right six times, then down three times to position the ""door"" rule next to a wall. Then, I can move through the newly created door to reach the ball. 

Wait, but I can only perform one action at a time. So, I need to choose the next step. Since I'm starting, I should move right to get closer to the ""door"" rule. 

Let me move right once to start heading towards the ""door."" That's the first step. 

But looking back, maybe I can take a different approach. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win,"" that would make the ball the win condition, which it already is. Maybe I need to change something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can make myself into the ball. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""ball,"" then ""baba is ball,"" which would make me the ball, and then I can reach the win condition. 

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me see where the ""baba"" rule is. It's three steps left and five steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I can move towards it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""baba"" and ""win."" If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win condition, and touching myself would complete the level. 

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is seven steps right and one up. That's far to the right. I'm not sure if I can reach it easily. 

I think the door approach is more feasible. Let me try that again. Move right six times to get to the ""door"" rule, then move it down three to position it next to a wall. 

But since I can only perform one action, I'll start by moving right once. 

Wait, maybe I can move right and then up or down to get closer. Let me check the exact positions. 

The ""door"" rule is six steps right and three down. I'm starting at the origin, so moving right six times would take me to column seven, row zero. Then, moving down three times would take me to column seven, row three. 

Is there a wall at column seven, row three? Let me check the objects. There's a wall at two steps right and three down, which is column four, row four. So, moving the ""door"" rule to column seven, row three might not be next to a wall. 

Maybe I need to adjust. Perhaps I should move the ""door"" rule to a different wall. Let me see where the walls are. There's a wall at two steps right and one up, which is column four, row negative one. Another wall at two steps right, which is column four, row zero. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to column four, row zero, which is a wall. Then, that wall becomes a door, and I can pass through. 

So, to do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule from column seven, row three to column four, row zero. That would require moving left three times and up three times. 

But I'm not sure if I can do that in one move. Maybe I need to plan a path. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""door"" rule next to a wall that's closer. Let me see. There's a wall at two steps right and one down, which is column four, row one. If I can move the ""door"" rule there, that wall becomes a door. 

So, moving the ""door"" rule from column seven, row three to column four, row one would require moving left three times and up two times. 

But again, I can only perform one action at a time. So, I need to decide the next step. 

Maybe I should move right once to start heading towards the ""door"" rule. That way, I can eventually reach it and move it to a wall's position. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a quicker way. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win,"" but that's already the case. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""you,"" making ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball. Then, I can move the ball to the win condition. 

But the ""ball"" rule is five steps right and one up. The ""you"" rule is one step left and five down. That's quite far apart. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition by moving it next to ""win,"" but that's already done. 

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to visualize the map. 

I'm at the starting position. To my right, there are walls and rule blocks. The ball is far down and to the left. The ""door"" rule is far to the right and down. 

Maybe I can move down to reach the ball, but there are walls blocking the way. If I can turn a wall into a door, I can pass through. 

So, I need to get to the ""door"" rule, move it next to a wall, and then pass through. 

Let me try moving right once to start heading towards the ""door"" rule. That's the first step. 

But wait, moving right once would take me to column three, row zero. Is there a wall there? Let me check. There's a wall at two steps right and one up, which is column four, row negative one. So, column three, row zero is clear. 

Okay, moving right once seems safe. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to reach the ""stop"" rule, but that might not help. 

I think the best course is to move right to reach the ""door"" rule, then use it to create a door through a wall. 

So, my next action is to move right once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall one step to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is four steps to the right and one up, ""is"" is five steps right and one up, and ""win"" is six steps right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule four steps to the left and an ""is"" rule three steps to the left. 

There's a key one step to the left, which might be important. Then, walls are placed at one step right, one step right and one down, and one step right and two down. The ""stop"" rule is one step left and three down. There's a door five steps right and three down. The ball is three steps left and four down. 

I need to figure out how to get the ball to the win condition. Since ""ball is win,"" I need to make the ball reach the win block. But how? I'm Baba, so I can move around. Maybe I need to move the rule blocks to change the rules. 

Wait, the key is one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But I'm not sure how that ties into the rules. Let me think about the rules. If I can rearrange the rule blocks, I can change what is what. For example, if I move ""ball"" next to ""win,"" maybe that changes the win condition. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to make Baba able to push the ball. Right now, the ball is just an object. If I can make it so that the ball is pushable, I can move it towards the win. How do I do that? Maybe by creating a new rule like ""ball is push."" 

But how do I create that rule? I need to move the ""ball"" and ""push"" rule blocks next to each other. Wait, do I have a ""push"" rule? I don't see it in the active rules. Hmm. Maybe I can break an existing rule to get the ""push"" property. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into something else. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can change that rule, I can become another object. For example, if I make ""baba is push,"" then I can push objects. 

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I need to create it by moving other rule blocks. Let me look again. There's a ""stop"" rule one step left and three down. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is probably making some objects immovable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe the walls become movable. But I'm not sure. 

Let me think about the ball's position. It's three steps left and four down. I need to get it to the win block, which is six steps right and one up. That's a long way. Maybe I can make the ball move on its own or make it so that when I move, the ball moves too. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make something else the win, like the door, then I just need to reach the door. But the current win is the ball, so I need to get the ball to the win block. 

Wait, the door is five steps right and three down. Maybe if I can open the door, I can reach the ball or the win block. But to open the door, I might need the key. The key is one step to the left. So maybe I should pick up the key first. 

If I move left once, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open the door. But how does that help with the ball? I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is a distraction, and I should focus on moving the rule blocks. Let me try to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" If I can do that, maybe the ball becomes the win condition, but it's already that. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball. Then I can move it to the win block. To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""you."" The ""you"" rule is two steps left and five down. So I need to get the ""ball"" rule there. 

But the ""ball"" rule is four steps right and one up. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule instead. The ""you"" rule is two steps left and five down. If I can move it next to the ""ball"" rule, then ""ball is you"" would be created. 

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? I need to be able to move it, which requires that it's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is one step left and three down. Maybe if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the ""you"" rule becomes movable. 

So, my plan is: move left to pick up the key, then use it to open the door, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule so that the ""you"" rule can be moved next to the ""ball"" rule, making ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball. 

Wait, but I'm already ""baba is you."" If I make ""ball is you,"" does that mean both Baba and the ball are me? Or does it replace it? I think it would create another ""you"" object, so I can control both. 

So, steps: 

1. Move left to pick up the key. 
2. Use the key to open the door. 
3. Move through the door to access the other side. 
4. Move the ""stop"" rule away so the ""you"" rule can be moved. 
5. Move the ""you"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule to create ""ball is you."" 
6. Now, I can control the ball and move it to the win block. 

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Maybe I can just move the rule blocks without it. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule first. 

If I move down three steps, I can reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like to the left or right, to make the ""you"" rule movable. 

Once the ""stop"" is moved, I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule. That should create ""ball is you,"" allowing me to control the ball. 

Then, I can move the ball to the win block, which is six steps right and one up. 

So, the key steps are: move the ""stop"" rule, then move the ""you"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule, then move the ball to the win. 

I think that's the plan. Now, I need to execute it step by step. 

First, I need to move down to get to the ""stop"" rule. So, I'll move down three times. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left and three down. So from my current position, I need to move left once and down three times. 

But I'm at the starting position. Let me see: 

- Current position: let's assume I'm at (0,0). 
- The ""stop"" rule is at (-1, -3). 
- So, I need to move left once and down three times. 

But moving left might take me into walls. Let me check the map again. 

There's a wall one step to the right and one step up. So, moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) is possible if there's no wall there. 

Wait, the objects on the map include a wall one step to the right and one step up, but nothing blocking me from moving left. So, I can move left once to (-1,0). 

Then, from there, I need to move down three times to (-1, -3) where the ""stop"" rule is. 

Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it somewhere else, like further down or to the side, so it's not blocking the ""you"" rule. 

After moving the ""stop"" rule, I can go to the ""you"" rule, which is two steps left and five down. So from (-1, -3), I need to move left one more step to (-2, -3), then down two more steps to (-2, -5). 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at (-2, -5). So, from (-1, -3), I move left to (-2, -3), then down two steps to (-2, -5). 

Once there, I can pick up the ""you"" rule and move it next to the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at (4,1). So, I need to move the ""you"" rule from (-2, -5) to (4,1). That's a long way. 

But maybe I can move it step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is. 

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at (4,1). To move it to (-2, -5), I need to move it left six steps and down six steps. That's a lot, but possible if I can move it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""ball"" rule next to the ""you"" rule without moving the ""you"" rule. 

But I think it's easier to move the ""you"" rule to the ""ball"" rule's location. 

Once the ""you"" rule is next to the ""ball"" rule, the new rule ""ball is you"" is created, allowing me to control the ball. 

Then, I can move the ball to the win block, which is at (6,1). 

Wait, the win block is at (6,1). So, once I can control the ball, I can move it right two steps from (4,1) to (6,1), which is the win condition. 

So, the steps are: 

1. Move left once to (-1,0). 
2. Move down three times to (-1,-3) to pick up the ""stop"" rule. 
3. Move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, like further down to (-1,-4). 
4. Move left once to (-2,-4). 
5. Move up once to (-2,-3). 
6. Move up again to (-2,-2). 
7. Move up to (-2,-1). 
8. Move up to (-2,0). 
9. Move up to (-2,1). 
10. Move right to (-1,1). 
11. Move right to (0,1). 
12. Move right to (1,1). 
13. Move right to (2,1). 
14. Move right to (3,1). 
15. Move right to (4,1) where the ""ball"" rule is. 
16. Now, the ""you"" rule is next to the ""ball"" rule, creating ""ball is you."" 
17. Now, I can control the ball. 
18. Move the ball right two steps to (6,1), which is the win block. 

Wait, that seems too long. Maybe there's a shorter way. 

Alternatively, after moving the ""stop"" rule, I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule more efficiently. 

But regardless, the key is to create ""ball is you"" so I can move the ball to the win. 

So, the first action I need to take is to move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule. 

Wait, no, the ""stop"" rule is at (-1,-3). So, I need to move left once and down three times. 

But in the initial move, I can only do one action. So, the first action should be to move left. 

Wait, but the user's last message shows the observation, and the assistant's response is the action. So, in the previous interaction, the user provided the observation, and the assistant responded with an action. 

In this case, the user provided the current observation, and I need to choose an action. 

So, based on the observation, I need to decide whether to move left, right, up, down, or idle. 

Given that, the best first step is to move left to start accessing the ""stop"" rule. 

So, the action is left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and one up, ""is"" is six steps right and one up, ""win"" is seven steps right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps left, and an ""is"" rule two steps left. 

There's a wall two steps right, another wall two steps right and one down, and another two steps right and two down. The ""stop"" rule is three steps down. Then a wall two steps right and three down, a ""door"" rule six steps right and three down. The ball is two steps left and four down. Walls are also at two steps right and four down, and so on.

So, I'm Baba, and I need to get the ball to win. The ball is at two left and four down. I'm probably starting somewhere else, maybe near the rules. The walls are blocking some paths, but I can move the rule blocks to change the rules.

I think I need to move the ""ball"" rule or the ""win"" rule to change the win condition. Maybe if I make ""baba is win,"" then I can just reach the win without needing the ball. Alternatively, I could make the ball moveable or change its properties.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I move that, maybe I can make something stop or not stop. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the positions. The ball is two left and four down. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through the walls by changing the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to create a new rule like ""baba is win."" That way, when I reach the win condition, I win without needing the ball. Let me see how to do that.

I can move the ""is"" rule from two left to where Baba is, then place it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" So, if I move the ""is"" rule two steps left to where ""baba"" is, and then move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can form ""baba is win."" That would change the win condition to me.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from its current position. Let me check the positions again. The ""is"" rule is two steps left and five steps down. Wait, no, in the current observation, the ""is"" rule is two steps left. So I can move it towards Baba.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize the map. Baba is probably at the starting point, and the rules are spread out. The ball is down and to the left. The walls are creating a path or a barrier.

Maybe I should move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else. If I move ""ball"" next to ""stop,"" then ""ball is stop,"" which would make the ball immovable. But I need the ball to be win, so that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to make ""baba is win,"" that would let me win by reaching the win condition. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule from seven steps right and one up to next to ""baba is you."" That way, ""baba is win"" becomes a rule.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's seven steps right and one up. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the walls first. The walls are at two steps right and various downs. If I can move a wall to clear the path, I can reach the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I move that, maybe I can make the walls stop moving or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to change the properties of walls.

The ""wall"" rule is three steps left. If I move it next to ""stop,"" then ""wall is stop,"" making walls immovable. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" That would change the win condition.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" rule from two steps left to next to ""baba,"" then move the ""win"" rule next to that to form ""baba is win."" Then, I can reach the win condition by moving to where the win rule is.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from its current position. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is two steps left. So, I can move left twice to get to it, then move it where I need.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me try to move left twice to pick up the ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""baba."" Then, move the ""win"" rule next to that to complete the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule first. It's seven steps right and one up. That's a bit far, but if I can clear the path, I can get there.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule first. Let me attempt to move left twice to get to the ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""baba."" Then, I can form ""baba is win.""

Wait, but the ""is"" rule is two steps left, so moving left twice from my starting position should get me there. Then, I can pick it up and move it next to ""baba,"" which is probably near me.

Once I've done that, I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" to complete the rule. Then, I can move to the win condition to win the level.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else, but I think changing the win condition is more straightforward.

So, the steps are:

1. Move left twice to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba.""
3. Move the ""win"" rule next to the new ""is"" rule to form ""baba is win.""
4. Move to the win condition to win.

But I need to make sure I can move the rules without being blocked by walls. Let me check the walls. There are walls two steps right and various downs, but if I move left, I can avoid them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I move down three times, I can pick it up, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make something stop, but I'm not sure how that helps.

I think the best approach is to change the win condition to ""baba is win,"" so I can win by reaching the win rule instead of needing the ball.

So, I'll move left twice to get the ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""baba,"" then move the ""win"" rule next to that to form the new rule.

Once that's done, I can move to the win condition and win the level.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll choose the action to move left twice to get the ""is"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control the baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is six steps right and one up, ""is"" is seven right and one up, ""win"" is eight right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule two steps left, an ""is"" rule one step left, and a key one step right.

The walls are positioned at three right, three right and one down, three right and two down. The stop rule is one right and three down. The door is seven right and three down. The ball is one left and four down. The baba rule is two left and five down, ""is"" is one left and five down, ""you"" is five down, and walls are at three right and four down, and three right and five down.

Hmm, so I need to get the ball to the win condition. Since ""ball is win,"" I need to make the ball reach the win block. But how? I'm controlling baba, so I can move around. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I need to pick up the key to open the door. The door is seven right and three down, so it's on the right side, lower down.

Wait, but the door is a rule block. Maybe I need to move it or use it somehow. The stop rule is one right and three down, so that's a block that stops movement. I need to avoid that or maybe use it to my advantage.

The ball is one left and four down. So it's to the left and lower down. I need to get the ball to the win block, which is eight right and one up. That's far to the right and a bit up. But the ball is on the left side, so I need to move it all the way to the right.

But how do I move the ball? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if you have the right rules. Since I'm baba, I can push the ball if I can get next to it. But the ball is one left and four down, so I need to get there.

Wait, the key is one step to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key first. If I move right once, I can get the key. Then, maybe the door can be opened with the key, allowing me to reach the ball or the win block.

Let me plan this out. First, I need to move right to get the key. So from my starting position, I move right once. Now I have the key. Then, I can go to the door, which is seven right and three down. But that's a long way. Maybe I can break some walls or rearrange rules to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""ball is win"" rule, I can change the win condition. But I don't think that's necessary here. I just need to get the ball to the win block.

Wait, the ball is one left and four down. So if I can get to that position, I can push the ball. But to get there, I might need to go down four steps and left once. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls. There's a wall at three right, three right and one down, three right and two down, three right and three down, three right and four down, and three right and five down. So the right side is blocked by walls, but the left side might be clearer.

Wait, I'm starting at some position. Let me assume I'm at the origin (0,0). The key is one right, so (1,0). The ball is one left and four down, so (-1,-4). The win block is eight right and one up, so (8,1). The door is seven right and three down, so (7,-3). The stop rule is one right and three down, so (1,-3).

So to get to the ball, I need to go left once and down four times. But are there walls blocking that path? Let me see. The walls are at (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (3,-2), (3,-3), (3,-4), (3,-5). So the right side is blocked, but the left side is clear. So I can move left once to (-1,0), then down four times to (-1,-4) where the ball is.

But wait, the key is at (1,0). If I move right once, I get the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open the door at (7,-3). But to get to the door, I need to go right seven times and down three times. That's a long path, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball first. If I can get to the ball, I can push it towards the win block. But the win block is at (8,1), which is far to the right and up. So I need to move the ball all the way right.

But the ball is at (-1,-4). To move it to (8,1), I need to push it right 9 times and up 5 times. That's a lot, but maybe possible if I can navigate around the walls.

Wait, but the stop rule is at (1,-3). If I step on that, I can't move. So I need to avoid that. Maybe I can move the stop rule somewhere else or break it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules. If I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules, I can create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"" or something, but I don't see a push rule here.

Wait, the active rules are only ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So I can't push unless I create a rule like ""baba is push."" But I don't have that rule yet.

Hmm, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""push"" blocks together. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. The available rule blocks are ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you.""

So I can't create a push rule. Therefore, I can't push the ball unless I have the ""push"" property. So maybe I need to find another way.

Wait, maybe I can move the ball by changing the rules. If I can make the ball move on its own, but I don't see a way to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the win block to where the ball is. But the win block is at (8,1). If I can move it to (-1,-4), then the ball would be on the win block, and I win. But how?

To move the win block, I need to have a rule that allows me to move it. Since ""ball is win,"" the win block is defined by the ball. So if I can change that rule, maybe I can make the win block moveable.

Wait, if I can break the ""ball is win"" rule, I can make the ball not the win condition anymore. But I need to create a new win condition. Maybe I can make ""baba is win"" or something else.

But I don't have a ""win"" rule block that I can move. The ""win"" rule is at (8,1). So maybe I can move the ""win"" rule block to where the ball is.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block from (8,1) to (-1,-4). But that's a long distance. I can only move rule blocks if they're not stopped by ""stop"" rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (1,-3). So if I can move the ""win"" rule block past that, I can get it to the ball's position.

But moving the ""win"" rule block would require me to be adjacent to it and push it, but I can't push unless I have the ""push"" property.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the key. The key is at (1,0). If I pick it up, maybe I can open the door at (7,-3). The door is a rule block, so maybe opening it changes something.

If I go to (1,0), pick up the key, then go to (7,-3), perhaps I can use the key to activate the door. Maybe the door rule changes when I have the key, allowing me to pass through.

But I'm not sure how the door works in this context. Maybe the door rule is ""door is open"" or something, but I don't see that rule active.

Alternatively, maybe the door is a block that I can move through when I have the key.

Wait, in Baba Is You, doors usually require a key to open. So if I have the key, I can pass through the door block.

So if I go to (1,0) to get the key, then go to (7,-3) where the door is, I can pass through it. But what's behind the door? Maybe it's a path to the ball or the win block.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move right once to (1,0) to get the key.
2. Then, move right six more times to (7,0), then down three times to (7,-3) where the door is.
3. With the key, I can pass through the door.
4. Then, perhaps I can reach the ball or the win block.

But wait, the ball is at (-1,-4), which is on the opposite side. So maybe after opening the door, I can find a way to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe the door leads to a path that allows me to move the ball.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ball first.

Wait, if I can't push the ball because I don't have the push rule, maybe I can make the ball move by changing the rules.

If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. But I don't have the ""you"" rule block next to the ball.

The ""you"" rule is at (1,-5). So if I can move the ""you"" rule to the ball's position, I can make the ball ""you,"" allowing me to control it.

But to move the ""you"" rule, I need to be able to push it. Again, I don't have the push rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to break the ""ball is win"" rule to free up the ball.

If I can move the ""is"" rule away from ""ball,"" then the ball is no longer win, but I can then move the ball.

But how? The ""ball"" rule is at (6,1), ""is"" at (7,1), and ""win"" at (8,1). So if I can move the ""is"" rule away, the ""ball is win"" rule breaks.

But to move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. But I can't push without the push rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule by using the key. If I have the key, maybe I can interact with the ""is"" rule differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule block. If I can move the ""ball"" rule to a different position, the rule changes.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move towards the ball. Starting at (0,0), I can move left once to (-1,0), then down four times to (-1,-4) where the ball is. But are there any walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls, they are at (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (3,-2), (3,-3), (3,-4), (3,-5). So the right side is blocked, but the left side is clear. So I can move left and down without issues.

Once I'm at (-1,-4), I can try to push the ball. But I don't have the push rule, so I can't push it. So I need to find a way to get the push rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""push"" blocks together, but I don't see a ""push"" rule. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is push"" by moving the ""is"" and ""push"" blocks, but again, no push block.

Hmm, maybe I need to use the key to open the door and find a push rule or something else.

Let me try to get the key first. Move right once to (1,0) to get the key. Then, move right six times to (7,0), then down three times to (7,-3) where the door is. With the key, I can open the door.

After opening the door, maybe I can find a way to the ball or a push rule. But I'm not sure what's behind the door.

Alternatively, maybe the door leads to a path where I can move the ball. But without knowing, it's hard to plan.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,-3). If I can move it somewhere else, I can avoid being stopped.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it, which I can't do without the push rule.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think differently.

What if I try to move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is? If I can move the ""win"" rule to (-1,-4), then the ball would be on the win block, and I win.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's at (8,1). I need to get there, but the path is blocked by walls on the right.

Wait, the walls are at (3,1), so from (0,0), I can move right three times to (3,0), but that's blocked by a wall. So I can't go right beyond (2,0) because (3,0) is a wall.

So I can't reach the ""win"" rule block because it's at (8,1), which is far to the right, but the walls block the way.

Hmm, maybe I need to break the walls. But I don't have a tool to break them unless I can create a rule like ""baba is break.""

But I don't have a ""break"" rule block. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to break walls. If I have the key, maybe it can be used to destroy walls. But I'm not sure how that works in this game.

Alternatively, maybe the key can be used to move walls. If I have the key, I can pick up walls and move them, but I don't think that's how it works.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ball somehow. If I can't push it, maybe I can make it move by changing the rules.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule to the ball's position.

The ""you"" rule is at (1,-5). So I need to move it to (-1,-4). But I can't push it without the push rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the ball's position, making the ball ""baba,"" which is ""you."" So the ball becomes me.

But the ""baba"" rule is at (2,-5). So if I can move it to (-1,-4), the ball would be ""baba,"" which is ""you,"" so I can control the ball.

But again, I can't push the ""baba"" rule without the push rule.

This is really frustrating. Maybe I need to look for another way.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule to my advantage. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to block the ball's path, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it stops the ball from moving, but I don't know.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the key first and see what happens.

So, I'll move right once to get the key. Then, I'll move right six times to (7,0), then down three times to (7,-3) where the door is. With the key, I can open the door.

After opening the door, maybe I can find a way to the ball or a new rule block that helps me.

But I'm not sure what's behind the door. It's a risk, but maybe it's the only way.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right once to get the key.
2. Move right six times to (7,0).
3. Move down three times to (7,-3) and open the door with the key.
4. Explore what's behind the door to find a way to the ball or a new rule.

I hope this works. Let's try it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control the baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and one up, ""is"" is six steps right and one up, ""win"" is seven steps right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps left, an ""is"" rule two steps left, and a key one step up.

Further down, there are more walls and rules. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. There's a ""stop"" rule three steps down, a ""door"" rule six steps right and three down, and the baba rule three steps left and five down, along with ""is"" and ""you"" rules.

Hmm, so I need to get the ball to the win condition. Since I'm baba, I can move around. The ball is two left and four down from me. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules.

I see the ""stop"" rule three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. Or perhaps I can create a new rule to make the ball moveable.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how? I'm not sure if the key does anything here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes the ball moveable. For example, if I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I can move the ball.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the ball, but walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop moving or become passable. Or perhaps I can move the ""door"" rule to create a passage.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is six steps right and three down. If I can move that to where the walls are, maybe I can create a door in the wall. But I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball directly. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the ball is to the left and down. There are walls blocking the path. The key is up, but I don't know if it's useful here.

Maybe I should move up to get the key, but I don't see a clear path. Alternatively, I can try to move right to access the rule blocks and rearrange them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I can move that to the walls, maybe I can stop them from blocking me. Or perhaps I can make the walls stop being solid by changing their rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to create a new rule that allows me to win without moving the ball. But that seems unlikely.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. Let me try moving down three steps to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to the wall's position to make them stop.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So I need to plan the path carefully. Let me try moving down step by step to reach the ""stop"" rule.

First, I'll move down once. Then, again, and again until I reach the ""stop"" rule. Once there, I can pick it up and move it to the wall's location.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make the ball moveable. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""ball"" rules together. If I can place ""ball"" next to ""is"" and another word, I can create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""you,"" I can make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. That might be a good approach.

So, I need to move the ""ball"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is. Let me see where the ""you"" rule is. It's one step left and five steps down. That's quite far.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to where the ""ball"" rule is. That might be easier.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me try to move right to access the rule blocks. I can move right to get to the ""ball"" rule, then move it to where the ""you"" rule is.

But I need to make sure I can reach the ""you"" rule. It's five steps down and one left. That might be a long path, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without moving the ball. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being where I am.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, to win, I need to make the ball reach the win condition, which is itself. That seems a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being in the win position. But I'm not sure where the win position is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is, making the ball the win condition. But that's already the case.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. Let me try that.

I'll move down three steps to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the wall's position. That might make the walls stop being solid.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So I need to plan each move carefully. Let me try moving down once, then again, and again until I reach the ""stop"" rule.

Once I have the ""stop"" rule, I can move it to the wall's location. That should make the walls stop being solid, allowing me to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to create a passage through the walls. The ""door"" rule is six steps right and three down. If I can move it to the wall's position, maybe it will create a door.

But I'm not sure how the ""door"" rule works. Maybe it's better to focus on the ""stop"" rule.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls will stop moving or become passable. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I can move it to the wall's position, maybe it will make the walls stop being solid.

So, I'll move down three times to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the wall's location. Let's say the wall is two steps right and one up. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule there.

But moving the ""stop"" rule requires me to carry it, which might block my movement. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make the ball moveable. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it through the walls.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Maybe I can create it by rearranging the rules.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""push"" to create ""ball is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule in the objects.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""ball"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is, making ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball.

The ""you"" rule is one step left and five steps down. That's quite far, but let's see.

I'll move left once to get closer, then down five times. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path.

Wait, the walls are two steps right and one up, so moving left might be possible. Let me try moving left once, then down five times to reach the ""you"" rule.

Once there, I can pick up the ""you"" rule and move it to where the ""ball"" rule is, making ""ball is you.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is. That might be easier.

But I'm not sure if I can carry both rules at the same time. Maybe I can only move one rule at a time.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule first to make the walls passable, then move the ""ball"" rule to make the ball moveable.

Let me try moving down three times to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the wall's position, which is two steps right and one up.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule requires me to carry it, which might block my movement. I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make the ball moveable. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it through the walls.

I'll move left once, then down five times to reach the ""you"" rule. Then, I'll move the ""you"" rule to where the ""ball"" rule is, making ""ball is you.""

Once that's done, I can move the ball to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is, making ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball directly.

I think that's the best approach. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control the baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ball, is, win, wall, is, key, etc. The key is one step to the right. There's also a door seven steps to the right and three steps down, and the ball is one step to the left and four steps down.

Hmm, so I need to get the ball to the win condition. But how? The ball is currently at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The win condition is the ball itself, so maybe I need to move the ball to where the win rule is, which is at 8 steps right and 1 step up.

Wait, but the ball is an object, and I can only move objects that aren't stopped. Are there any stop rules? I see a rule `stop` at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So that's a stop block. I can't move through that.

I control baba, which is at some position. I need to figure out where I am. The baba rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So maybe I'm near there. I need to move towards the ball or the win condition.

Let me visualize the map. The walls are creating a sort of barrier. The key is one step to the right, which might unlock the door. The door is seven steps right and three steps down. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door, which would allow me to reach the ball or the win condition.

Wait, but the ball is the win condition. So if I can move the ball to where the win rule is, that might solve it. But how do I move the ball? I can only move objects that are not stopped. Is the ball stoppable? I don't see a rule that says ""ball is stop."" So maybe I can move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules. If I can move the ""ball is win"" rule, I could redefine what wins. But that might complicate things.

Let me think about the key. If I can get the key, I can open the door. The door is seven steps right and three steps down. So I need to get to the key first. The key is one step to the right. So I should move right to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door. But how do I use the key? In Baba Is You, usually, you pick up the key and then approach the door. So I need to move to the key, then to the door.

After opening the door, I can access the area beyond. Maybe that's where the ball is. The ball is one step left and four steps down. So after opening the door, I can go down to reach the ball.

Once I have the ball, I can move it to the win condition. The win condition is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So I need to move the ball there.

Wait, but the ball is already the win condition. So maybe I just need to move the ball to where the win rule is, which is the same as the ball's position. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to change the win condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the win condition is the ball, so if I can make the ball reach the exit or a specific location, that would win.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move right to get the key.
2. Move to the door and open it.
3. Go down to get the ball.
4. Move the ball to the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I can just move the ball directly without needing the key. Let me check the map again.

The ball is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The win rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So I need to move the ball all the way to the right and up. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, and other positions. So maybe I need to break through the walls or find a path.

Wait, can I move the walls? The rule `wall` is at 2 steps left. So if I move the wall rule, I can change what walls do. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push them. But I don't see a push rule here.

Alternatively, if I can move the wall rule to make walls stop, but that might not help. Hmm.

Maybe the key is necessary to unlock the door, which is blocking the path to the ball. So I should focus on getting the key first.

So, I'm at the starting position. I need to move right to get the key. Let me try that.

I'll move right once to pick up the key. Then, I can go to the door, which is seven steps right and three steps down. But that's a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the door is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So from the key's position, which is 1 step right, I need to go 6 more steps right and 3 steps down. That seems possible.

But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, and other positions. So I might need to go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the door rule. The door rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move it, I can change the door's behavior.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to get the key first.

So, I'll move right once to get the key. Then, I can proceed to the door.

After opening the door, I can go down to get the ball. Then, I can move the ball to the win condition.

Wait, but the ball is already the win condition. So maybe I just need to move the ball to where the win rule is, which is the same as the ball's position. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the win condition is the ball, so if I can make the ball reach the exit or a specific location, that would win.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball directly. Let me see if I can move it.

The ball is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. I need to move it to 8 steps right and 1 step up. That's a long distance. Are there any obstacles?

The walls are in the way, but if I can move the walls, maybe I can clear a path. But I don't see a rule that allows me to push walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make walls movable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push them out of the way.

But I don't see a push rule in the active rules. So that might not be possible.

Hmm, maybe I need to use the key to open the door, then go get the ball, and then move it to the win condition.

So, step by step:

1. Move right to get the key.
2. Move down to the door.
3. Open the door.
4. Move down to get the ball.
5. Move the ball to the win condition.

But I'm not sure about the exact path. Let me try to visualize it.

From the starting position, moving right once gets me the key. Then, I need to go to the door, which is seven steps right and three steps down. So from the key's position, I need to move six steps right and three steps down.

But there are walls at 3 steps right and 1 step up, which might block my path. So maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to make walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them.

But I don't see a pass rule. So that might not work.

Wait, the rule `stop` is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So that's a stop block. I can't move through that. So I need to find a way around it.

Maybe I can move the stop rule. If I can move it somewhere else, I can clear the path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the door rule. If I can move the door rule to a different position, I can open it without needing the key.

But I don't see a way to do that. The door rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ball directly. Let me see.

The ball is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. I need to move it to 8 steps right and 1 step up. That's a lot, but maybe I can do it step by step.

But I can only move the ball if it's not stopped. I don't see a stop rule on the ball, so I think I can move it.

So, I'll move the ball right step by step until it reaches the win condition.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ball through the map, avoiding walls and stop blocks.

Wait, the stop block is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So I need to make sure the ball doesn't hit that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the stop rule. If I can move it somewhere else, the ball can pass.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make something else the win condition, I can win without moving the ball.

But the active rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to keep that.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the key first.

I'll move right once to get the key. Then, I can proceed to the door.

After opening the door, I can go down to get the ball. Then, I can move the ball to the win condition.

So, the first step is to move right to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and one up, ""is"" is six steps right and one up, ""win"" is seven steps right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps left, an ""is"" rule two steps left, and a key one step up. 

Further down, there are more walls and rules. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. There's a ""stop"" rule three steps down, a ""door"" rule six steps right and three down, and some more walls and rules related to Baba and you. 

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around to rearrange the rules. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win"" to make a new rule like ""ball is win,"" but that's already active. Wait, maybe I need to change the win condition or make the ball reachable.

I see a key one step up. Maybe I need to get the key to open a door. The door is six steps right and three down. But to get to the key, I might need to move through the walls. But walls are stop by default unless I change the rules.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls passable. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""wall"" rule and ""is"" rule next to ""not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the ""win"" rule to reinforce that the ball is the win condition. But that's already active. Maybe I need to move the ball itself to the win position. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. I need to get there.

But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule and ""is"" rule next to ""not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""wall"" rule away from ""is"" and ""stop.""

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps down. If I move the ""wall"" rule next to ""stop,"" I can create ""wall is stop,"" but that's the default. Maybe I need to create a different rule. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make a new rule like ""baba is win"" to change the win condition, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win,"" but that's already active. Maybe I need to move the ball object to the win position. The ball is two steps left and four steps down. I need to get there, but walls are in the way.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball. Then I can move the ball to the win position. Let me see: if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can move the ball. So I need to move the ""ball"" rule and ""is"" rule next to ""you."" The ""you"" rule is one step left and five steps down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can get there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to make ""baba is win,"" so I just need to reach the win condition. But the win condition is the ball, so that might not help.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door. The door is six steps right and three down. If I can get to the door, maybe I can open it with the key. But to get to the door, I need to move right, but walls are blocking me.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make it passable without the key. If I can make ""door is not stop,"" I can walk through it. But again, I don't see a ""not"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""win"" to make sure the win condition is set. Or maybe I need to move the ""ball"" rule to the ""is"" rule to make ""ball is something else.""

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach the win condition, which is the ball. But I'm already Baba, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position, so when I reach the ball, it triggers the win. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, let me think about the movement. I can move up, down, left, right. I need to get to the ball, which is two steps left and four steps down. But walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""wall"" rule away from ""is"" and ""stop."" So if I move the ""wall"" rule three steps left, which is where it is, maybe I can separate it from ""is"" and ""stop.""

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is three steps left. The ""is"" rule is two steps left. So if I move the ""wall"" rule further left, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let me try moving left.

But I'm Baba, so I can only move where I can. The walls are two steps right, so maybe I can move left to get to the ""wall"" rule. Let me try moving left once. Then I can move the ""wall"" rule further left to break the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""ball"" to make ""ball is win,"" but that's already active.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to the ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already set. Maybe I need to move the ball object to the win position.

The ball is two steps left and four steps down. I need to get there, but walls are blocking. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" I can walk through them.

But without a ""not"" rule, maybe I can just move the ""wall"" rule away from ""is"" and ""stop."" So if I move the ""wall"" rule three steps left, which is where it is, maybe that's enough to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is three steps left. The ""is"" rule is two steps left. So if I move the ""wall"" rule further left, say four steps left, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because ""wall"" is no longer next to ""is"" and ""stop.""

So I think the plan is: move left to get to the ""wall"" rule, then move it further left to break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable. Then I can move through the walls to reach the ball and win.

So first, I need to move left to get to the ""wall"" rule. Let me try moving left once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ball, is, win, wall, is, key, etc. The key is one step to the right. There are walls in various positions, and a stop rule one step to the right and three steps down. The door is seven steps to the right and three steps down. The ball is one step to the left and four steps down. 

Hmm, so I need to get the ball to the win condition. Since ""ball is win,"" I think I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But wait, the win condition is already defined as the ball, so maybe I need to move the ball to a position where it's considered a win. Or perhaps I need to change the rules so that the ball can be moved or interacted with.

I see the key is one step to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. The door is seven steps to the right and three steps down. So perhaps I need to get to the door, but it's blocked by walls. The stop rule is one step to the right and three steps down, which might be preventing me from moving through that area.

I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me try to visualize the map. Starting from my position, I can move right three steps and up one to reach a wall. That might be a barrier. The key is just one step to the right, so maybe I can pick that up. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which is further to the right and down.

But wait, the door is seven steps to the right and three steps down. That's quite a distance. I need to figure out how to get there. There are walls in the way, so maybe I need to break them or find a path around. The stop rule is in the way, so perhaps I can move it or change it.

I also see that there are rule blocks for baba, is, you, etc. Maybe I can rearrange these to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. Or maybe ""key is you"" so I can move the key.

Wait, the key is one step to the right. If I move right, I can pick it up. But I'm Baba, so I can only move if I'm not stopped by a wall or the stop rule. Let me check the stop rule's position: one step to the right and three steps down. So if I move right and then down, I might hit the stop rule and can't proceed further.

Maybe I should first move up to avoid the stop rule. Let me try moving up one step. Then I can move right towards the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door. But the door is seven steps to the right and three down, which is a bit tricky. Maybe I can break down the walls or find a way around.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that helps. Or maybe ""stop is nothing,"" which would remove the stop effect.

Wait, the stop rule is one step to the right and three down. If I can move that rule block somewhere else, I can clear the path. But to move it, I need to be able to reach it. Let me see: from my starting position, moving right one step is the key, then further right are walls. So maybe I can't reach the stop rule directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules so that I can pass through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule block. Hmm.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" Maybe I can change ""baba is you"" to something else. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. Let me see if I can move the ""is"" and ""key"" rule blocks to form ""baba is key.""

Looking at the objects, the rule `is` is one step to the left and five steps down, and the rule `key` is one step to the right. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and the ""key"" block, I can form a new rule. But I'm not sure how to do that from my current position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""baba is key."" That way, I can pick up the key. But I need to be able to move the key block, which might be possible if I can reach it.

Wait, the key is one step to the right. If I move right, I can pick it up. But I'm Baba, so I can only move if I'm not stopped. Let me try moving right. If I move right, I can pick up the key. Then, with the key, I can open the door.

But the door is seven steps to the right and three down. That's a long way. Maybe I can break down the walls or find a shortcut. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the key to unlock the door and then proceed to the win condition.

Wait, the ball is one step to the left and four steps down. So if I can get the ball to the win condition, which is the ball itself, maybe I just need to move the ball to a position where it's considered a win. But I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, maybe I need to make the ball the win condition by moving it to a specific location. But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule block to the ball's position.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. So if I can move the ""win"" block to the ball's position, then the ball would be the win condition. But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules so that the ball is the win condition, which it already is. So perhaps I just need to get the ball to a position where it's considered a win. But I'm not sure how that works.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move right to pick up the key. Then, I can go to the door and open it. Once the door is open, I can proceed to the win condition.

So, my plan is: move right to pick up the key, then move towards the door, use the key to open it, and then proceed to the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move right without being stopped. Let me check the stop rule's position again: one step to the right and three steps down. So if I move right and then down, I'll hit the stop rule and can't proceed. So maybe I should move up first to avoid it.

Let me try moving up one step. Then, I can move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can move down towards the door, but I'll hit the stop rule. So maybe I need to change the stop rule or find another path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the stop rule block somewhere else. But to do that, I need to be able to reach it. It's one step to the right and three steps down. So if I can move down three steps from the key's position, I can reach it. But I'm not sure if I can do that without being stopped.

Wait, if I have the key, maybe I can use it to move the stop rule. But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can break the stop rule by changing its property.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make ""stop is nothing"" by moving the ""is"" and ""nothing"" blocks, but I don't see a ""nothing"" block.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the rule blocks again. There's a ""baba"" rule block three steps to the left and five steps down, an ""is"" block two steps to the left and five steps down, and a ""you"" block one step to the left and five steps down. So if I can move these blocks, I can change the rules.

If I can move the ""baba"" block next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. But maybe I can change it to something else, like ""baba is key,"" so I can pick up the key.

Wait, the key is one step to the right. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. Let me see if I can rearrange the rule blocks to do that.

The ""is"" block is one step to the left and five steps down, and the ""key"" block is one step to the right. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and the ""key"" block, I can form ""baba is key."" But I'm not sure how to move the ""is"" block from its current position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is."" But the ""key"" block is one step to the right, so I can move it left to be next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

Wait, if I can move the ""key"" block two steps to the left, it would be next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" forming ""baba is key."" Then, I can pick up the key by moving onto it.

But how do I move the ""key"" block? I need to be able to move it, which requires that it's not stopped by any rules. Since the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you,"" the key is just an object that can be moved if it's not defined as stop.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and three steps down. So the key is one step to the right, which is not stopped. So I can move the key block.

So, my plan is: move the key block two steps to the left, so it's next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" forming ""baba is key."" Then, I can pick up the key by moving onto it. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it, then proceed to the win condition.

But wait, moving the key block requires that I can reach it. The key is one step to the right, so I can move right to pick it up. But I need to move it two steps to the left, which would require me to be able to move it from its current position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block instead. The ""is"" block is one step to the left and five steps down. If I can move it up to be next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I can form ""baba is key.""

But moving the ""is"" block would require me to be able to reach it. It's five steps down, which is quite far. I'm not sure if I can get there without being stopped.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the win condition. The ball is one step to the left and four steps down. If I can move the ball to the win condition, which is itself, maybe I just need to move it to a specific location.

But I'm not sure how to move the ball. It's an object, so I can push it if I can reach it. Let me see where it is: one step to the left and four steps down. So if I can move left and down, I can reach it. But I need to avoid the stop rule.

Wait, the stop rule is one step to the right and three steps down. So if I move left and down, I might avoid it. Let me try moving left and down to reach the ball.

Once I reach the ball, I can push it to the win condition. But the win condition is the ball itself, so I'm not sure how that works. Maybe I need to move the ball to a specific location where it's considered a win.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to change the win condition. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I just need to reach the door. But I don't see a ""door"" rule block near the win block.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. So if I can move the ""win"" block to the door's position, then reaching the door would be a win. But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is door,"" so the ball becomes the door, but that doesn't seem helpful.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to move the key first. Let me try moving right to pick up the key. Then, I can use it to open the door. Once the door is open, I can proceed to the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move right without being stopped. Let me try moving right. If I move right, I can pick up the key. Then, I can move towards the door, but I'll hit the stop rule. So maybe I need to change the stop rule or find another path.

If I can move the ""baba"" block next to ""is"" and ""key,"" I can make ""baba is key,"" allowing me to pick up the key. But I'm not sure how to move the ""baba"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is."" The ""key"" block is one step to the right, so I can move it left to be next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

Wait, if I can move the ""key"" block two steps to the left, it would be next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" forming ""baba is key."" Then, I can pick up the key by moving onto it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is six steps right and one up, ""is"" is seven steps right and one up, and ""win"" is eight steps right and one up. There's also a ""wall"" rule two steps left and one up, and an ""is"" rule one step left and one up. 

There's a key one step to the right. Walls are at three steps right, three right and one down, three right and two down. The ""stop"" rule is one step right and three down. Walls continue at three right and three down, and the ""door"" rule is seven right and three down. The ball is one left and four down. More walls are at three right and four down, and some rules: ""baba"" two left and five down, ""is"" one left and five down, ""you"" five down, and a wall at three right and five down.

So, I'm Baba, and I need to get the ball to win. The ball is at one left and four down. I'm probably starting somewhere else, maybe near the key. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I can pick it up. But how does that help? Maybe the door is locked, and I need the key to open it. The door rule is at seven right and three down. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one right and three down. That might be a wall or something that stops me. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can change what stops movement. But I'm not sure. 

I think the key is important. If I move right to get the key, then maybe I can use it to open the door. Once the door is open, I can reach the ball. But how do I move the key? Or maybe the key is just an object I need to collect. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules. For example, if I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win,"" it's already ""ball is win."" Maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

I'm a bit confused about the layout. Let me try to visualize it. The ball is at one left and four down, which is probably below me. The door is at seven right and three down, which is far to the right. The key is one step right, so maybe I can pick it up and then go towards the door. 

But wait, the ""stop"" rule is one right and three down. If I go down three steps from the key, I might hit a stop. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else so I can pass. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make it open without needing the key. But I'm not sure how that works. 

I think the best course of action is to move right to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go towards the door. So, I'll choose the right action.

It seems like the rule blocks are arranged in a line to the right, starting from the ball rule at five steps right and one up, followed by ""is"" at six steps right, and ""win"" at seven steps right. 

There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps to the left and one step down, and another ""is"" rule two steps to the left and one down. The key is one step to the right. There are multiple walls positioned at two steps right and varying down steps. The ""stop"" rule is three steps down, and the ""door"" rule is six steps right and three down. 

The ball is two steps to the left and four steps down. There are more walls and rule blocks below that. The ""baba"" rule is three steps left and five down, ""is"" is two steps left and five down, and ""you"" is one step left and five down. 

So, my goal is to make the ball the win condition, which it already is. But I need to figure out how to get the ball to the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I need to pick up the key to open the door. 

The door is six steps to the right and three down. To get there, I need to move right and down. But there are walls in the way. The ""stop"" rule is three steps down, which might be preventing me from moving further down. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at three steps down. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can change it. But how? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP."" So, if I can change the rule, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the ball win without needing to move it. But the ball is already set as win. Maybe I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. 

Looking at the ball's position, it's two steps left and four steps down. I'm at the starting position, which I think is the origin. So, to get to the ball, I need to move left and down. But there are walls blocking the way. 

Wait, the walls are at two steps right and varying down steps. So, if I move left, I might not hit walls. Let me see: moving left from the origin would take me to (-1,0), then (-2,0), etc. The walls are at (2, y), so moving left shouldn't interfere with them. 

So, maybe I can move left to reach the ball. But the ball is two steps left and four down. So, I need to move left twice and down four times. But are there walls in that path? The walls are at (2, y), so moving left from (0,0) to (-2, -4) shouldn't hit any walls. 

Once I reach the ball, maybe I can push it or something. But in Baba Is You, you can only move objects if you're adjacent to them and can push them. So, I need to get next to the ball and then push it towards the win condition. 

But the win condition is the ball itself, so maybe I just need to move the ball to where the win condition is. Wait, the win condition is already the ball, so maybe I just need to make sure the ball is in a position that triggers the win. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ball to the door, which is six steps right and three down. But that's on the other side of the map. 

Wait, the door is at (6, -3). To get there, I need to move right six steps and down three. But there are walls at (2, y), so moving right beyond that might be blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make the walls not stop me, I can move through them. 

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule three steps left and one down. If I can move that rule, I can change what walls do. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push through walls. 

But how do I move the rule blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and push them. The ""wall"" rule is at (-3, -1). So, I need to move left three steps and down one to reach it. 

From my starting position, moving left three steps would take me to (-3,0). Then down one step to (-3,-1), where the ""wall"" rule is. Then I can push it somewhere else. 

If I push the ""wall"" rule to the right, maybe I can change the rule. For example, if I place it next to ""is"" and ""push,"" it would become ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push through walls. 

But I need to make sure that the ""is"" and ""push"" rules are in the right place. The ""is"" rule is at (6,1), (7,1), etc. So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule to where the ""is"" and ""push"" rules are. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and another property. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (3,-3). If I can change that, maybe I can stop the walls from blocking me. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to move the ball to the win condition. Since the ball is already the win condition, maybe I just need to move it to a position where it's considered won. 

But how? In Baba Is You, the win condition is usually when you reach the win object. So, if the ball is the win, I need to make the ball reach a certain position. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself the ball, so I can move as the ball. But the rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm already controlling Baba. 

Wait, maybe I can change the rule to ""baba is ball,"" making me the ball. Then I can move as the ball and reach the win condition. 

To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" rule next to ""ball."" The ""baba"" rule is at (-3,-5), ""is"" is at (-2,-5), and ""you"" is at (-1,-5). 

If I can move the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""ball,"" I can create ""baba is ball."" 

But how do I move the ""baba"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and push it. It's at (-3,-5). So, I need to move down five steps and left three steps from the origin. 

That's a long way. Maybe there's a better way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""you,"" making ""ball is you,"" but that might not help. 

Wait, the key is at (1,0). Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock the door. The door is at (6,-3). So, if I can get to the door, maybe I can open it with the key. 

But to get to the door, I need to move right six steps and down three. But there are walls at (2,y), so moving right beyond that is blocked. 

Unless I can change the wall rules to make them passable. 

So, maybe the plan is:

1. Move left to reach the ""wall"" rule at (-3,-1).
2. Push the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule, like ""wall is push.""
3. Then, I can push through walls to reach the door.
4. Use the key to open the door.
5. Then, move the ball to the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ball to the win condition directly. The ball is at (-2,-4). I need to get there, pick up the ball, and move it to the win position. 

But how? I'm at (0,0). Moving left twice and down four times would get me to (-2,-4), where the ball is. Then, I can push the ball somewhere. 

But the win condition is the ball, so maybe I just need to move the ball to a position where it's considered won. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, the win condition is when you reach the win object. So, if the ball is the win, I need to make the ball reach the win position. 

But the win rule is at (7,1). So, maybe I need to move the ball to (7,1). 

But that's far away. Maybe I can change the win condition to be where the ball is. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the win and then move it to the win position. 

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving left to reach the ball and see what happens. 

So, my first move should be to move left to start heading towards the ball. That way, I can assess the situation better once I'm closer.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""key,"" and so on. It seems like the rules are spread out in a line to the right. The ball is one step to the left and four steps down, which is somewhere below me. There's also a door seven steps to the right and three steps down, which might be relevant.

I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and rearrange the rule blocks. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I need to pick that up or use it somehow. The door is down and to the right, so perhaps I need to get to it.

Wait, the ball is win, so if I can make the ball reach the win condition, I can win. But how? Maybe I need to move the ball or change the rules so that the ball can be moved. Right now, the ball is just an object; maybe I can make it pushable or something.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""stop"" one step to the right and three steps down. That might be blocking something. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can unblock the path for the ball or myself.

I think the key is to move the ""stop"" rule so that it's not blocking the door. If I can get to the door, maybe I can open it and reach the ball. Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule by rearranging the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

Let me plan my steps. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move towards the key first. So, I'll go right once to pick up the key. Then, I can use the key to open the door. But wait, the door is seven steps to the right and three steps down. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move the rule blocks to create a path or change the rules to make movement easier.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""ball"" rule closer to the ""win"" rule to make the ball the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary since ""ball is win"" is already active.

Wait, maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule to allow the ball to move. If the ball is stopped, I can't win. So, moving the ""stop"" rule might be the key. Let me try moving down three steps to reach the ""stop"" rule. Once I'm there, I can move it somewhere else, maybe to the left or up, to unblock the path.

After moving the ""stop"" rule, I can then proceed towards the door. With the key, I can open the door and reach the ball. Once the ball is in the win position, I can win the level.

So, my first move should be to go down three steps to reach the ""stop"" rule. That way, I can rearrange it and clear the path for the ball or myself.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can get the ball to the win condition, I'll win the level. Also, since I'm Baba, I can move around and manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and two steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" and ""wall"" spread out to the right and up. There's also a key one step to the right and one step up, which might be useful for opening a door later. 

The door is seven steps to the right and two steps down. The ball is one step to the left and three steps down. There are more walls and rule blocks scattered around, including ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" near the bottom.

I need to figure out how to get the ball to the win condition. Since the ball is currently one step to the left and three steps down, I might need to move it closer. But how? The ball is an object, so I can't move it directly unless I change the rules to make it movable.

Wait, the active rule is ""ball is win."" Maybe if I can change that rule, I can make the ball something else, like ""you"" or ""move."" But I don't see a ""move"" rule here. Alternatively, I could create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to make the ball something else.

Let me think about the positions. The ""ball"" rule is six steps to the right and two steps up. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and two steps up. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the ""is"" block to be next to the ""ball"" and ""win"" blocks, I might be able to form a new rule.

But I'm Baba, so I can move around. I need to get to the ""is"" block. Let me see how far that is. The ""is"" block is seven steps to the right and two steps up. I'm currently at the starting position, so I need to move right seven times and up two times. But there are walls in the way. The wall is three steps to the right and two steps up, so I can't go straight right beyond that.

Maybe I can go around the walls. Let me check the layout. There's a wall three steps right and two up, another wall three right and one up, and so on. It seems like the walls are forming a barrier on the right side. Maybe I can go down first to avoid them.

If I move down, I can go around the walls. Let me try moving down a few steps. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and two steps down. That might block me, but if I can move past it, I can reach the door or the ball.

Wait, the door is seven steps to the right and two steps down. If I can get to the door, maybe I can open it with the key. The key is one step to the right and one step up, so I can pick it up first.

Let me plan this out. I'll move right to get the key. From my starting position, moving right once gets me to the key. Then, I can move down to go around the walls. But I need to be careful not to hit any walls or the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to reach the ""is"" block. But the walls are in the way. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving right as much as possible, then up or down to navigate around the walls.

Another idea: if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""you,"" I can make the ball into ""you,"" allowing me to control it. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks into position. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, so I'd have to move it up to where the ""ball"" is.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""win"" to change the win condition. If I can make ""ball is win"" into something else, maybe I can win by reaching the door or another object.

Wait, the door is seven steps to the right and two steps down. If I can get to the door, maybe that's the win condition. But the active rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to change that. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door to make ""door is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from eight steps right and two up to next to the door, which is seven steps right and two down. That would require moving the ""win"" rule down four steps and left one step. But can I do that? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block between ""door"" and ""win."" But I don't see a ""door"" rule in the active rules, so that might not work.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""you"" to make the ball into ""you,"" allowing me to control it. Then I can move the ball to the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to be between ""ball"" and ""you.""

The ""ball"" rule is six steps right and two up. The ""is"" rule is seven steps right and two up. The ""you"" rule is four steps down. So I need to move the ""is"" block down to where ""you"" is, but that's four steps down. That might be possible if I can navigate around the walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step right and two down. If I move down past that, I might be stopped. I need to avoid that.

Maybe I can move right three steps to get past the initial walls, then move up or down accordingly. Let me try moving right three steps to get to the wall, then up one step to go over it. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can move down first to avoid the walls. Let me try moving down two steps, then right as much as possible. But I need to be careful not to hit the ""stop"" rule.

This is really challenging. I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the ball movable or change the win condition. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""is"" block to create a new rule that allows me to control the ball or change what wins the level.

I'm going to try moving the ""is"" block from seven steps right and two up to next to the ""ball"" rule. That way, I can form ""ball is [something]"" to make it movable. But I'm not sure what to make it. Maybe ""ball is move"" but I don't see a ""move"" rule here.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule next to the ""ball"" and ""is"" blocks. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, so I need to move it up to where the ""ball"" is.

This requires moving the ""you"" rule up four steps, but I'm not sure if that's possible with the current layout. There might be walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is. That would require moving it down four steps, but again, walls might be in the way.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the key. The key is one step to the right and one step up. If I can get the key, maybe I can open the door, which is seven steps right and two down. But I need to get past the walls to reach the door.

To get the key, I just need to move right once. Then, I can move down to go around the walls. Let me try that. Move right to get the key, then move down to avoid the walls. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it, which might be the win condition.

But the active rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to make sure that the ball reaches the win condition. If I can get the ball to the door after opening it, that might work. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can make the door the win condition, then reaching it would win the level. To do that, I need to change the rule to ""door is win."" That would require moving the ""win"" rule next to the ""door"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps right and two up. The ""door"" rule is seven steps right and two down. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down four steps and left one step. That seems difficult with the current layout.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule between ""door"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""win"" rule itself.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""you"" to make the ball into ""you,"" allowing me to control it. Then I can move the ball to the win condition. But I need to figure out how to move the ""you"" rule up to where the ""ball"" is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the ball movable. For example, ""ball is move."" But I don't see a ""move"" rule here, so that might not work.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to open the door and then use the door as the win condition. If I can get the key, open the door, and then reach it, that might work. Let me try that.

First, move right to get the key. Then, move down to go around the walls. Once I'm past the walls, I can go to the door and open it. Then, I can move into the door to win.

But I'm not sure if the door is the win condition. The active rule is still ""ball is win,"" so I need to make sure the ball reaches the win condition. Maybe after opening the door, I can move the ball into it.

Alternatively, maybe opening the door changes the win condition. I'm not sure, but it's worth a try.

I think I'll try moving right to get the key, then down to reach the door. Once I have the key, I can open the door and see what happens. Maybe that will change the win condition or allow me to move the ball into it.

So, my plan is: move right to get the key, then move down to reach the door, open it, and then see if I can move the ball into it to win.

Let me try that. First, move right once to get the key. Then, move down to go around the walls. Once I'm at the door, use the key to open it. Then, I can move into the door to win.

But wait, the active rule is ""ball is win,"" so I need to make sure the ball is the one that reaches the win condition. Maybe after opening the door, I can move the ball into it.

Alternatively, maybe opening the door changes the win condition to the door. If that's the case, then reaching the door would win the level.

I'm not sure, but I'll try moving right to get the key, then down to the door, and open it. Let's see what happens.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and two steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and two up, ""is"" is six steps right and two up, ""win"" is seven steps right and two up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps left and one up, and an ""is"" rule two steps left and one up. There's a key one step up, walls at various positions, a ""stop"" rule two steps down, a ""door"" rule six steps right and two down, a ball two steps left and three down, and some more walls and rules related to Baba and you.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and rearrange the rule blocks. The key is one step up, which might be useful for opening a door, but I'm not sure yet.

I think the main goal is to get the ball to the win condition. But wait, the ball is already defined as win. Maybe I need to move the ball to a position where it can trigger the win. Alternatively, perhaps I need to change the win condition or make the ball reachable.

Looking at the map, the ball is two steps left and three down. I'm Baba, so I can move towards it. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to see if I can move them or break them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being walls. Or perhaps I can rearrange the rules to make the walls movable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the win block. But the current win is the ball, so maybe I need to change that.

Let me think about the steps. I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. I need to move towards the ball. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being solid.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop being a wall. But I'm not sure how that works exactly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else. But I'm not sure. Let me try to visualize the map.

I'm at the origin. The ball is two left and three down. So to get to it, I need to move left twice and down three times. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the walls' positions.

There's a wall two right and two up, another two right and one up, two right, two right and one down, two right and two down, two right and three down, two right and four down. So the walls are on the right side, forming a sort of barrier.

The key is one step up, which might be useful for opening a door. The door rule is six right and two down. So if I can get the key and open the door, maybe I can access another area.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe I can just move the ball to the win position. The win rule is seven right and two up. So if I can move the ball there, it would trigger the win.

But how do I move the ball? Since I'm Baba, I can push objects if they're movable. Are the walls movable? The ""stop"" rule is two down, so maybe if I can move that, I can make the walls stop being solid.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, does that make the wall stop being a wall? Or does it make the wall stop moving? I'm a bit confused about how the rules work.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the win block. But the current win is the ball, so maybe I need to change that.

Let me try to plan my moves. I need to get to the ball, which is two left and three down. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable.

I can move down twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, perhaps I can move it to a wall to make it stop being a wall. But I'm not sure exactly how that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else. But I'm not sure. Let me try to move down twice to get to the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. So from my starting position, I can move down twice to reach it. Then, I can pick it up and move it to a wall. Maybe that will make the wall stop being a wall, allowing me to pass.

Once I can pass through the walls, I can move left to reach the ball. Then, I can push the ball to the win position, which is seven right and two up. But that seems far. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the win block. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe I need to get the key first to open the door. The door is six right and two down. So if I can get the key, I can open the door and access another area.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary for this level. Maybe the main goal is just to get the ball to the win position.

Let me try to move down twice to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to a wall to make it passable. Once the walls are passable, I can move left to get the ball and then push it to the win position.

So, my first move should be to move down twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to a wall. Let's say I move it to the wall two right and two up. That might make that wall stop being a wall, allowing me to pass.

After that, I can move left to reach the ball. Then, I can push the ball to the win position. Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ball directly.

Wait, but the ball is two left and three down. So after making the walls passable, I can move left and down to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable, then move to the ball and push it to the win position.

So, my first action should be to move down twice to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to a wall.

Wait, but in the observation, the ""stop"" rule is two steps down. So from my starting position, I can move down twice to reach it.

So, my first move is down, then down again. But I need to choose one action at a time.

Wait, the user is asking for a single action. So I need to decide which direction to move first.

Given that, I think moving down is the first step to reach the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and three steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and three up, ""is"" is six right and three up, ""win"" is seven right and three up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three left and two up, and an ""is"" rule two left and two up. A key is two steps up. 

Other walls are positioned at two right and two up, two right and one up, and just two right. The ""stop"" rule is one step down, and there's a wall two right and one down. The ""door"" rule is six right and one down. The ball is two left and two down, and there are more walls and rules below that.

So, my goal is to get the ball to the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I need to move around to rearrange the rules or objects. The ball is two left and two down from me. I need to figure out how to get it to the win position, which is seven right and three up.

Wait, but the ball is a win condition, so if I can make the ball reach the win block, that should solve the level. But how? Maybe I can move the ball by changing the rules. 

Looking at the rules, I can see that ""ball is win"" is already active. So, if I can make the ball move towards the win block, that would work. But how do I make the ball move? In Baba Is You, objects can be moved if they're not stopped by ""stop"" rules. 

I see a ""stop"" rule one step down. Maybe if I can move that stop rule away, the ball can move. Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule that allows the ball to move. 

Wait, the ball is two left and two down. I'm at the starting position, which I think is the origin. So, to get to the ball, I need to move left twice and down twice. But I have walls in the way. Let me check the walls. 

There's a wall two right and three up, which is above me. Then walls at two right and two up, two right and one up, and two right. So, moving right is blocked by walls. Moving left might be possible. 

I can try moving left to reach the ball. Let me see: if I move left twice, I can get to the ball's position, but I need to go down two steps as well. Are there walls blocking that path? 

Looking at the objects, there's a wall two right and one down, but that's to the right. To the left, I don't see walls in the down direction. So maybe I can move left twice and down twice to reach the ball. 

Once I'm next to the ball, I can push it. But wait, can I push it? The ball is an object, so if I'm Baba, I can push it if there's space. The win block is seven right and three up, which is far to the right and up. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball directly. But I'm not sure if that's possible. 

Let me think about the rules. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks to make ""ball is you,"" that would let me control the ball. 

Looking at the rule blocks, there's an ""is"" rule two left and two up, and a ""you"" rule one left and three down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""ball"" rule, and the ""you"" block next to that, I can create ""ball is you."" 

But how do I move those rule blocks? I need to move them by pushing them, but they might be fixed unless I change their properties. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the rule blocks movable. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes the rule blocks movable. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to move the ball directly. Since the ball is two left and two down, I can try to move left twice and down twice to get next to it, then push it towards the win block. 

But I need to make sure there's a clear path. Let me visualize the map. Starting from my position, moving left twice would take me to the ball's column, and down twice would get me to its row. Then, I can push it right towards the win block. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball move towards the win block automatically. But I'm not sure how to do that without more information. 

I think the most straightforward approach is to move to the ball, pick it up, and carry it to the win block. So, I'll start by moving left twice and down twice to reach the ball. 

Wait, but moving down might take me into walls. Let me check the walls again. There's a wall two right and one down, but that's to the right. To the left, I don't see walls in the down direction. So, moving down twice should be possible. 

Once I'm next to the ball, I can push it. Let me plan the steps: 

1. Move left twice to align with the ball's column. 
2. Move down twice to reach the ball's row. 
3. Push the ball right towards the win block. 

But I need to make sure the path is clear. The win block is seven right and three up, which is quite far. Maybe I can move the ball step by step. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball move towards the win block. For example, if I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it more easily. 

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me try moving to the ball first. 

So, my first move should be to the left. Let me choose the ""left"" action to start moving towards the ball.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall three steps to the right and three steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is six steps right and three up, ""is"" is seven right and three up, ""win"" is eight right and three up. There's also a ""wall"" rule two left and two up, an ""is"" rule one left and two up, and a key one right and two up. 

The walls are positioned at various points, and there's a ""stop"" rule one right and one down. The door is seven right and one down. The ball is one left and two down. There are more rule blocks for ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" at different positions, and walls are scattered around.

So, my goal is to get the ball to the win condition. Since ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But wait, the win condition is defined by the rule ""ball is win,"" so maybe I need to change that rule to make something else the win condition? Or perhaps I need to move the ball to where the win rule is.

I'm controlling Baba, so I can move around. The key is one right and two up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. The door is seven right and one down, so maybe I need to get to the door, but it's blocked by walls. 

Looking at the walls, they're in the way, but maybe I can break them by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But right now, the rule is ""wall is you"" or something else? Wait, the active rules are only ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So walls are just walls unless I change their properties.

I think I need to move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, making ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win"" to change the win condition. But the ball is already the win condition. Maybe I need to move the ball itself to the win location.

Wait, the ball is one left and two down from my current position. So if I move left twice and down twice, I can reach the ball. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall three steps right and three up, which is above me. Then walls are at three right and two up, three right and one up, and three right. So the right side is blocked by walls, but the left is open. 

So, I can move left. Let me plan the steps. I'm currently at the starting position. To get to the ball, which is one left and two down, I need to move left once and down twice. But I have to make sure there are no walls in that path.

Wait, the walls are on the right side, so moving left should be clear. Let me try moving left. 

After moving left, I'm one step left. Then I need to move down twice. But I have to check if there are walls down. The walls are at three right and one down, three right and two down, etc., so moving down from my current position (one left) should be clear.

So, I can move left, then down, then down again to reach the ball. Once I have the ball, I can move it to the win condition. But where is the win condition? The rule ""win"" is eight right and three up. That's far to the right and up. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win. But I'm not sure if that's possible right now.

Wait, the door is seven right and one down. If I can get to the door, maybe that's the win. But the door is blocked by walls. Unless I can remove the walls by changing their properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, but that's already the case. Hmm.

I think the best approach is to move the ball to the win location. So, I need to pick up the ball and move it to where the win rule is. But to do that, I need to reach the ball first.

So, my first step is to move left to get closer to the ball. Then, I can move down to reach it. Once I have the ball, I can carry it to the win location.

Wait, but the ball is one left and two down. So, from my current position, I need to move left once, then down twice. Let me try that.

First, move left. Then, move down twice. That should get me to the ball. Once I have the ball, I can move it to the win location, which is eight right and three up. That's a long way, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to something closer. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win. The key is one right and two up. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" making ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me see. The ""key"" rule is one right and two up. The ""win"" rule is eight right and three up. To make ""key is win,"" I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" But that's a long distance. Maybe it's easier to just move the ball.

I think the straightforward approach is to move the ball to the win location. So, I'll start by moving left to reach the ball.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall four steps to the right and three steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is seven steps right and three up, ""is"" is eight steps right and three up, and ""win"" is nine steps right and three up. There's also a ""wall"" rule one step left and two up, and an ""is"" rule two steps up. 

There's a key two steps right and two up, which might be useful later. The walls are positioned at four right and two up, four right and one up, and four right. The ""stop"" rule is two right and one down, and the ""door"" is eight right and one down. The ball is two steps down, which is interesting because it's below me. 

There are more walls at four right and one down, four right and two down, and four right and three down. The ""baba"" rule is one left and three down, ""is"" is three down, and ""you"" is one right and three down. 

So, my goal is to get the ball to the win condition. Since ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But the ball is two steps down, and the win condition is nine steps right and three up. That seems far. 

Wait, maybe I can change the rules. If I can move the ""ball"" rule or the ""win"" rule, I might be able to make the win condition closer. Let me see where the rule blocks are. The ""ball"" rule is seven right and three up, ""is"" is eight right and three up, and ""win"" is nine right and three up. 

If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that would help. But how? I need to move the ""win"" rule block. To do that, I need to be able to move it, which means it shouldn't be stopped by any ""stop"" rules. The ""stop"" rule is two right and one down, so I need to avoid that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I could make a new rule like ""win is something."" But I'm not sure. 

Wait, another approach: since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba to pick up the ball. The ball is two steps down, so I can move down twice to get it. Once I have the ball, maybe I can carry it to the win condition. 

But the win condition is nine steps right and three up. That's a long way. Maybe I can change the win condition to be somewhere else. If I can move the ""win"" rule block to where the ball is, then the ball would be the win condition, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a different object. If I can create a rule like ""ball is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. 

Wait, looking back, the ""stop"" rule is two right and one down. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent it from stopping me. But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: the key is two right and two up. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door. The door is eight right and one down. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and maybe reach the win condition. 

But to get the key, I need to move two right and two up. Let me see if that's possible. From my current position, moving right twice and up twice. Are there any walls blocking me? The walls are at four right and three up, so moving two right and two up should be clear. 

Once I have the key, I can go to the door at eight right and one down. But that's still far. Maybe after getting the key, I can move further right. 

Wait, but the ball is two steps down. If I can get the ball, maybe I can use it somehow. But I'm not sure how. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule. If I can make ""ball is something,"" maybe I can change its properties. 

Let me try to plan my moves. First, I need to get to the key. So, I'll move right twice and up twice. That should get me to the key. 

After getting the key, I can go to the door. But the door is eight right and one down. That's a lot. Maybe I can find a shorter path or change the rules to make it easier. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is, then the ball would be the win condition, and I can just be near it. But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" rule. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is nine right and three up. That's far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to it to create a new rule. But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba to the ball. The ball is two steps down. So, I can move down twice to pick it up. Then, maybe I can carry it to the win condition. 

But the win condition is nine right and three up. That's a long way. Maybe I can change the win condition to be where I am. If I can make ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you,"" then maybe I can make ""baba is win"" as well. 

Wait, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would be the rule, and I would win immediately. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already the case. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ball first. Let me try to move down twice to get the ball. 

After getting the ball, I can move it to the win condition. But that's nine right and three up. That's a lot. Maybe I can find a way to make the win condition closer.

So, I'll move right twice and up twice to get the key. Then, I can go to the door. But the door is eight right and one down. That's a long way. Maybe after getting the key, I can find a shortcut.

So, I'll move right twice and up twice to get the key. Then, I can go to the door. But the door is eight right and one down. That's a long way. Maybe after getting the key, I can find a shortcut. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to open the door, which leads to the win condition. So, I need to get the key, open the door, and then reach the win condition. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ball first. Let me try moving down twice to get the ball. 

After getting the ball, I can move it to the win condition. But that's nine right and three up. That's a lot. Maybe I can find a way to make the win condition closer. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is nine right and three up. If I can move it closer, that would help. But I need to move it, which requires being next to it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you."" There's also a key 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and a ball 2 steps down. 

Hmm, I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The ball is 2 steps down, so maybe I can move towards it. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the positions again.

The ball is at 2 steps down, which is probably below me. The walls are to the right and up, so maybe I can go left or down. Wait, the key is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first to open a door or something. 

But the door rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. That's pretty far. Maybe I don't need the door right now. The stop rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move the stop rule, maybe I can change the movement. 

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, if I can make the ball win, I just need to reach it. But the ball is 2 steps down. Are there any walls blocking me? Let me see: walls are 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and 4 steps to the right. So, the right side is blocked, but maybe I can go left or down.

I'm at the starting position, which I think is the origin (0,0). The ball is at (0,-2). So, I can move down twice to reach it. But wait, are there any walls in the way? The walls are all to the right, so maybe the path down is clear. 

Let me try moving down. If I move down once, I'm at (0,-1). Then down again to (0,-2), where the ball is. But the active rule is ""ball is win,"" so stepping on the ball should win the level. 

Wait, but the ball is an object, so maybe I need to pick it up or something. Or perhaps just being on the same tile as the ball triggers the win condition. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ball to the win position. But the win rule is 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is way over there. That seems complicated. 

I think the simplest thing is to move down twice to reach the ball. Let me try that. So, first move down, then down again. 

But wait, the previous attempt didn't work because I didn't choose a valid action. I need to make sure I output the correct action. So, I should choose ""down"" as my action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is 7 steps right and 4 up, ""is"" is 8 right and 4 up, ""win"" is 9 right and 4 up. There's also a ""wall"" rule 1 step left and 3 up, and another ""is"" rule 3 up. A key is 2 right and 3 up. Walls are spread out in various positions, and there's a ""stop"" rule 2 right, a ""door"" rule 8 right, and a ball 1 step down. Other walls and rules are placed down the map.

Hmm, so I need to get the ball to the win condition. Since ""ball is win,"" I need to make the ball reach the win block. But how? I'm Baba, so I can move around. Maybe I can move the ball by changing the rules.

Wait, the ball is 1 step down. I'm at the starting position, which I think is the origin. So the ball is just below me. If I can move the ball, maybe I can push it towards the win block. But how do I move the ball? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but the ball is a separate object.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the ball moveable. If I can make the ball ""push"" or ""pull,"" then I can move it. But I don't see any ""push"" or ""pull"" rules here. Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""you"" so I can control it directly. But that might not be necessary.

Wait, the key is 2 steps right and 3 up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the rules. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps right. If I move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can prevent something from moving. But I'm not sure.

The ""door"" rule is 8 steps right. Maybe I need to open a door to get to the ball or the win block. But I don't see a door object, just the rule. So maybe I need to create a door by moving the rule.

Wait, the ball is 1 step down. If I can move the ball up, maybe I can get it to the win block. But how? Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Maybe I can move the ball by pushing it, but I don't have a rule that allows me to push. Alternatively, I can change the rules to make the ball moveable.

Let me look at the rule blocks. There's a ""ball"" rule 7 right and 4 up, ""is"" 8 right and 4 up, ""win"" 9 right and 4 up. If I can move these rules, I can create new rules. For example, if I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""ball is win,"" which is already active. But maybe I can create another rule, like ""ball is push"" or something.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 left and 3 up. If I move that, I can create a new wall or remove an existing one. But I'm not sure if that's helpful. The ""is"" rule is 3 up, so maybe I can combine it with other rules.

The key is 2 right and 3 up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock a door. But I don't see a door object, just the rule. So maybe I need to create a door by moving the ""door"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 right. If I move that, I can stop something from moving. But I'm not sure what's moving. Maybe the ball is stuck because of a stop rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer to the ball. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it down to where the ball is, then the ball can reach it.

But how do I move the rules? I can move the rule blocks by moving them into a new position. For example, if I move the ""win"" rule down, I can place it near the ball.

Wait, the ball is 1 step down. If I can make the ball move up, it can reach the win rule. But I don't have a rule that allows the ball to move. Maybe I can create a rule like ""ball is push"" or ""ball is move.""

Alternatively, I can make myself (Baba) able to push the ball. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""baba is push,"" then I can push the ball.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Hmm. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""push"" or something. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can use the key. The key is 2 right and 3 up. If I move the key to the door rule, which is 8 right and 1 down, maybe I can unlock the door and get to the ball.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to plan step by step.

1. I need to get the ball to the win condition. The ball is 1 step down from me. The win rule is 9 right and 4 up.

2. I can move around as Baba. Maybe I can go right to reach the ball.

3. The ball is 1 step down, so I can move down to where the ball is.

4. Once I'm next to the ball, maybe I can push it, but I don't have a push rule.

5. Alternatively, I can change the rules to make the ball moveable.

6. Let me look at the rule blocks. The ""ball"" rule is 7 right and 4 up. The ""is"" rule is 8 right and 4 up. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up.

7. If I move the ""ball"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create ""ball is win,"" which is already active. But maybe I can create another rule.

8. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""ball is push.""

9. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule. Hmm.

10. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop,"" I can make ""stop is something.""

11. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ball is, so the ball can reach it.

12. Let me try moving the ""win"" rule down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it down to where the ball is, which is 1 step down, then the ball can reach it.

13. To move the ""win"" rule, I need to move it step by step. But I'm not sure how many steps I can move it in one action.

14. Alternatively, I can move the ball up to where the win rule is. But the ball is 1 step down, and the win rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's a long way.

15. Maybe I can create a path for the ball to move up. But I don't have a rule that allows the ball to move.

16. Wait, if I can make the ball ""you,"" then I can control it. But that might not be necessary.

17. Alternatively, I can make the ball ""push"" so I can push it. But I don't have a ""push"" rule.

18. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something. The key is 2 right and 3 up. If I move the key to the door rule, which is 8 right and 1 down, maybe I can unlock the door and get to the ball.

19. But I'm not sure how the door works. Maybe the door is blocking the path to the ball.

20. Alternatively, I can ignore the key and focus on moving the ball directly.

21. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it down 5 steps, it would be at 9 right and -1 up, which is below the current position. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

22. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule to the same position as the ball, which is 1 step down. Then the ball would be on the win condition.

23. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 9 right and 4 up to where the ball is, which is 1 step down. That's a big move, but maybe I can do it step by step.

24. But I can only move one step at a time. So I need to plan a path for the ""win"" rule to move down.

25. Alternatively, I can move the ball up to where the win rule is. But the ball is 1 step down, and the win rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's a long way.

26. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball moveable. For example, ""ball is move"" or ""ball is push.""

27. To create ""ball is move,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""move."" But I don't see a ""move"" rule here.

28. Alternatively, I can use the existing rules to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something.""

29. Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 7 right and 4 up, ""is"" is 8 right and 4 up, and ""win"" is 9 right and 4 up. If I move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""ball,"" I can make ""ball is something.""

30. But I need to create a new rule that allows the ball to move. Maybe ""ball is push.""

31. But I don't have a ""push"" rule. Hmm.

32. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 2 right. If I move it, I can stop something from moving.

33. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to block the ball from moving, but that doesn't help.

34. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to allow the ball to move. But I'm not sure.

35. Alternatively, I can move the ""door"" rule to create a door that I can open with the key.

36. The ""door"" rule is 8 right and 1 down. If I move it to where the ball is, maybe I can create a door that the ball can pass through.

37. But I'm not sure how that would help.

38. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""win"" rule down to where the ball is. That way, the ball can reach the win condition without moving.

39. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 9 right and 4 up to 1 step down. That's a big move, but I can do it step by step.

40. Let me plan the steps:

- Move the ""win"" rule left 8 steps to get it to the same column as me.

- Then move it down 5 steps to get it to 1 step down.

But that's a lot of steps, and I can only move one step at a time. Maybe there's a faster way.

41. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule diagonally, but I don't think that's allowed. I can only move up, down, left, or right.

42. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down step by step until it's next to the ball.

43. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it down one step, it becomes 9 right and 3 up. Then again to 9 right and 2 up, and so on until it's at 9 right and -1 up, which is below the current position.

44. But that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

45. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball moveable. For example, ""ball is push.""

46. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule. Hmm.

47. Alternatively, I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule next to the ball, maybe I can stop it from moving, but that doesn't help.

48. Wait, maybe I can make the ball ""you."" If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball directly.

49. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you."" The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down.

50. So, I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 right and 4 up to next to ""you,"" which is 1 right and 3 down.

51. That would create the rule ""ball is you,"" making the ball controllable.

52. But I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 right and 4 up to 1 right and 3 down. That's a big move, but I can do it step by step.

53. Let me plan the steps:

- Move the ""is"" rule left 7 steps to get to 1 right and 4 up.

- Then move it down 7 steps to get to 1 right and -3 up, which is 3 down.

But that's a lot of steps, and I can only move one step at a time.

54. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule diagonally, but I don't think that's allowed.

55. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think again.

56. The ball is 1 step down. If I can make the ball ""win,"" it's already the win condition. But I need to get the ball to the win block.

57. Wait, the win block is 9 right and 4 up. If I can move the ball to that position, it will win.

58. But how? I need to make the ball moveable.

59. Maybe I can create a rule like ""ball is move."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""move,"" but I don't see a ""move"" rule.

60. Alternatively, I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule next to the ball, maybe I can stop it from moving, but that doesn't help.

61. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to allow the ball to move. But I'm not sure.

62. Alternatively, I can move the ""door"" rule to create a door that I can open with the key.

63. The ""door"" rule is 8 right and 1 down. If I move it to where the ball is, maybe I can create a door that the ball can pass through.

64. But I'm not sure how that would help.

65. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""win"" rule down to where the ball is. That way, the ball can reach the win condition without moving.

66. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it down one step, it becomes 9 right and 3 up. Then again to 9 right and 2 up, and so on until it's at 9 right and -1 up, which is below the current position.

67. But that's a lot of steps, and I can only move one step at a time. Maybe I can move it left first to make it easier.

68. If I move the ""win"" rule left 8 steps, it would be at 1 right and 4 up. Then I can move it down 5 steps to get it to 1 right and -1 up, which is 1 step down.

69. That way, the ""win"" rule would be next to the ball, and the ball would trigger the win condition.

70. So, the plan is:

- Move the ""win"" rule left 8 steps to 1 right and 4 up.

- Then move it down 5 steps to 1 right and -1 up (1 step down).

71. But I can only move one step at a time. So I need to move the ""win"" rule left step by step.

72. Let me start by moving the ""win"" rule left once. That would be the action ""left.""

73. After that, I can continue moving it left until it's at 1 right and 4 up.

74. Then, I can move it down step by step until it's at 1 right and -1 up.

75. Once the ""win"" rule is next to the ball, the ball will be on the win condition, and I'll win the level.

76. So, the first step is to move the ""win"" rule left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is 8 steps right and 4 up, ""is"" is 9 steps right and 4 up, and ""win"" is 10 steps right and 4 up. There's also a ""wall"" rule 3 steps up, an ""is"" rule 1 step right and 3 up, and a key 3 steps right and 3 up. 

Further down, there's another wall 5 steps right and 3 up, another at 5 right and 2 up, and 5 right and 1 up. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps right, and the ""door"" rule is 9 steps right. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step down. There's a wall 5 right and 1 down, a ""baba"" rule 2 steps down, an ""is"" rule 1 right and 2 down, a ""you"" rule 2 right and 2 down, and a wall 5 right and 2 down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and rearrange the rule blocks. The ball is currently 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move the ball to the win position. But how?

Wait, the win condition is defined by the ""ball is win"" rule. So if I can move the ball to where the win rule is, that might work. But the win rule is 10 steps right and 4 up, which is pretty far. Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition by rearranging the rules.

I see there's a ""door"" rule 9 steps right and 1 down. Maybe if I can make the door the win condition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can make the ball move towards the win condition.

I also notice there's a key 3 steps right and 3 up. Maybe the key is needed to open a door, but I'm not sure how that ties in. 

Let me think about the movement. I'm Baba, so I can move around. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step down from my current position. If I can move the ball towards the win rule, that might help. But how do I move the ball? Since the ball is an object, I can push it if I'm adjacent.

Wait, but the ball is 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I move right and down, I can get next to the ball. Then I can push it towards the win rule. But the win rule is 10 steps right and 4 up, which is a long way. That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the ball win without moving it so far. For example, if I can make the ball's position the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

The ""win"" rule is 10 steps right and 4 up. The ball is 1 step right and 1 down. So I need to move the ""win"" rule closer. But moving rule blocks requires me to be adjacent to them. 

Let me see the positions again. The ""win"" rule is 10 right and 4 up. The ball is 1 right and 1 down. The ""is"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. So if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to the ball, I can create a new rule like ""ball is win"" again, but maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing ""ball is win"" rule by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks away, then create a new rule where the ball is somewhere else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the key to unlock something. The key is 3 right and 3 up. Maybe there's a locked door that I need to open, but I don't see a door in the immediate vicinity. The ""door"" rule is 9 right and 1 down, which is far.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball first. If I move right and down, I can get next to the ball and push it. Let's see: from my current position, moving right once and down once would get me next to the ball. Then I can push it right or up towards the win rule.

But the win rule is so far away. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule that makes the ball win without moving it. For example, if I can make the ball's current position the win condition.

Wait, the ""ball is win"" rule is already active. So when the ball reaches the win condition, I win. But the win condition is the ""win"" rule's position. So I need to move the ball to where the ""win"" rule is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is. That way, the ball is already at the win condition, and I win immediately.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block. The ""win"" rule is 10 right and 4 up. I need to get there, but that's a long way. Maybe I can find a shortcut or use other rule blocks to change movement.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 right. If I can move that, maybe I can change how movement works. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""door"" rule. If I can make the door open, perhaps it leads to a shortcut. But I don't see how yet.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move the ball towards the win rule. So I'll start by moving right and down to get next to the ball, then push it towards the win rule.

So, first, I'll move right once, then down once to reach the ball. Then I can push it right or up. Let's say I push it right. Then I can continue moving right and up to guide the ball towards the win rule.

But this might take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to win without moving the ball so far. For example, if I can make the ball's current position the win condition.

To do that, I need to rearrange the rules. I can take the ""win"" rule and move it next to the ball, then create a new ""is"" rule between them. But moving the ""win"" rule from 10 right and 4 up is difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is win"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe I can break the existing rule by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks away, then create a new rule that makes the ball win in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I can make the ball into a different object. For example, if I can make the ball into a ""you"" or ""baba,"" then I can control it. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to unlock something that allows me to move the ball more easily. The key is 3 right and 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe I can open a locked door or something.

But I'm not sure. I think the best approach is to move towards the ball and start pushing it towards the win rule. So I'll start by moving right and down to reach the ball.

First, I'll move right once. Then down once to get next to the ball. Then I can push it right. Let's see:

1. Move right
2. Move down
3. Push right

But I need to make sure I'm adjacent to the ball before pushing. Let me confirm the positions. The ball is 1 right and 1 down from me. So moving right and down should get me next to it.

Wait, if I'm at (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then down to (1,-1), which is where the ball is. So I can't push it from there. Maybe I need to move right, then down, then right again to push it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first, then right. Let me think.

If I move down first, I go to (0,-1). Then right to (1,-1), which is where the ball is. Then I can push it right to (2,-1).

Yes, that makes sense. So the sequence would be:

1. Move down
2. Move right
3. Push right

This way, I move down to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1) where the ball is, then push it right to (2,-1).

After that, I can continue moving right and up to guide the ball towards the win rule. But this might take a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to make the ball move automatically.

Wait, perhaps if I can make the ball a ""you"" or ""baba,"" it will move on its own. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule like ""ball is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

I think the safest approach is to manually push the ball towards the win rule. So I'll start by moving down, then right, then push right.

So the first action is to move down.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 5 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""key,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" ""you."" The ball is located 1 step to the right. 

Wait, the ball is only 1 step to the right? That seems close. Since ""ball is win,"" if I can reach the ball, I should win. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. 

Let me visualize the map. The wall is 5 right and 5 up, which is pretty far. The rule blocks are spread out, but the key is 3 right and 4 up. The door is 9 right and 1 up. The stop rule is 3 right and 1 up. 

Hmm, I'm at the starting position. The ball is just 1 step to the right. So, if I move right once, I should reach the ball and win. But wait, are there any walls or other rules blocking me? 

Looking at the walls, the closest one is 5 right and 5 up, which is far away. The other walls are also far. So, there's no immediate obstacle between me and the ball. 

But wait, the rule ""stop"" is 3 right and 1 up. Does that affect me? If ""stop"" is a rule, maybe it's preventing me from moving further. But since I only need to move right once, maybe I can just reach the ball before hitting any stop blocks. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, I can clear the path. But that might take more steps, and I'm already close to the ball. 

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. If I move right once, I should be on the ball, which is the win condition. That seems straightforward. 

Wait, but in the previous observations, sometimes moving the ball or rules was necessary. Maybe I need to make sure that the ball is indeed reachable. Let me check the positions again. 

The ball is 1 step to the right. There's a wall 5 right and 5 up, which is not in the way. The stop rule is 3 right and 1 up, which is above me, not directly in the path. So, moving right once should be safe. 

I think the best course of action is to move right once to reach the ball and win the level. That seems the most direct approach without complicating things further.
