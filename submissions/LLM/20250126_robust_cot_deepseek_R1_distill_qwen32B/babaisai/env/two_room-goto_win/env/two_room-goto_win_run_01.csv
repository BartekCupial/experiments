Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps right and 4 up. Then there are several rule blocks: key, is, win, wall, stop, etc. The key is 1 step down from my current position, which is probably where I start. There are also walls around, so I need to figure out how to move without getting blocked.

My goal is to get the key, which is the win condition. But to do that, I might need to change the rules. Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules.

First, I should check if I can move any of the rule blocks. The walls are probably stop blocks, so I can't move through them. The key is win, so if I can make the key accessible, I can win.

Wait, the key is 1 step down. If I move down, can I reach it? But there's a wall 4 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe I'm not directly under the key. Let me visualize the map.

I think the key is positioned such that I can't reach it directly because of walls. So I need to change the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into the key or change the win condition to something else. But since the key is win, I need to get the key.

Let me see the positions again. The key is 1 step down. There's a wall 4 right and 1 down, so maybe the key is behind a wall. I can't move through walls unless I change the rules.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule so that walls are no longer stop. How? If I can move the ""stop"" rule block to combine it with a wall, making ""wall is stop"" into something else.

Wait, the current rule is ""wall is stop"" because the walls are immovable. If I can break that rule, maybe by moving the ""stop"" block away, then walls won't stop me anymore.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. It's 3 steps right and 2 up. I can move towards it. Let me plan the steps.

First, I need to move right 3 times and up 2 times to reach the ""stop"" block. But I have to make sure I can move through any walls in the way. Wait, if the walls are stop, I can't move through them. So maybe I need to change the rule before moving.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is you"", then I can move through walls. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is key"", then I can become the key and win immediately. But how?

The rule blocks are scattered. I have ""baba is you"" as the active rule. If I can move the ""key"" rule block next to ""baba"", maybe I can create ""baba is key"".

Looking at the positions, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""key"" rule is 7 right and 4 up. That's far away. Maybe I can move the ""key"" block closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I can win without the key. But the current win condition is key, so that might not help.

Wait, the key is win, so if I can make myself the key, then I can win. So how to do that.

I think the best approach is to move the ""key"" rule block next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is key"". But the ""key"" block is far away. Let me see if I can move it.

The ""key"" rule is 7 right and 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move it step by step. But I can only move one block at a time, and I have to move through the map.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""key is you"", then the key becomes me, and I can win.

Wait, the ""key"" is win, so if I can make ""key is you"", then I can win by being the key. But I'm already Baba, which is you. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is key"", so that I become the key and win.

But how to do that. The ""you"" rule is 1 right and 2 down. So if I can move the ""you"" block next to ""key"", making ""you is key"", then I can win.

Wait, but the ""you"" block is 1 right and 2 down. I'm at the starting position, which I think is where ""baba is you"" is. So maybe I can move towards the ""you"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block down to where the ""you"" block is, making ""key is you"".

But the ""key"" block is 7 right and 4 up, which is far. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I can win.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The key is 1 step down, but there's a wall in the way. So I can't reach it directly. I need to change the rules to make the wall passable.

The ""stop"" rule is 3 right and 2 up. If I can move that, then walls won't stop me. So I need to move the ""stop"" block.

But to move the ""stop"" block, I need to get to it. Let me see the path.

I'm at the starting position. Let's say I'm at (0,0). The ""stop"" block is at (3,2). So I need to move right 3 and up 2.

But there are walls in the way. For example, there's a wall at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1). So moving right 4 steps would hit a wall. Wait, no, the walls are at 4 right and various up/down steps.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, etc. So moving right 4 steps would take me to the wall. So I can't go beyond that unless I change the rule.

So maybe I need to change the rule before moving. Let me think.

If I can move the ""stop"" block, then walls won't stop me. But to move the ""stop"" block, I need to reach it. So perhaps I can move the ""stop"" block first.

Wait, the ""stop"" block is at 3 right and 2 up. So if I can move right 3 and up 2, I can reach it. But are there walls in the way?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up, but that's further up. So moving right 3 and up 2, I might not hit a wall yet. Let me check.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and various up steps. So moving right 3 steps would be at x=3, which is before the wall at x=4. So I can move right 3 steps without hitting a wall. Then up 2 steps.

So I can move right 3, up 2 to reach the ""stop"" block. Once there, I can move it somewhere else, perhaps to the left or down, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" block to combine it with another word to create a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" block next to a wall, making ""wall is stop"" into something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" block away, then the walls are no longer stop, so I can pass through them.

So the plan is:

1. Move right 3 steps to reach x=3.
2. Then move up 2 steps to reach the ""stop"" block at (3,2).
3. Once there, I can move the ""stop"" block, perhaps down or left, to break the rule.

But wait, I can only move one block at a time. So I need to move the ""stop"" block after reaching it.

But how? Once I'm on the ""stop"" block, I can move it. So I can pick it up and move it somewhere else.

For example, moving it down to (3,1), which is where the wall is at (4,1). But that might not help.

Alternatively, moving it left to (2,2), which is empty, so the rule ""stop"" is now at (2,2), but that doesn't change anything because the walls are still stop unless the rule is changed.

Wait, no. The rule ""wall is stop"" is active because the ""stop"" block is next to ""wall"". If I move the ""stop"" block away, then the rule is broken, and walls are no longer stop.

So by moving the ""stop"" block, I can make walls passable.

So the steps are:

- Move right 3, up 2 to reach the ""stop"" block.
- Then move it, say, left to (2,2), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.

Then, I can go down to get the key.

But wait, the key is 1 step down from my starting position. So after making walls passable, I can move down through the wall to get the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key up to me.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, I need to move right 3 steps. So the first action is right.

Wait, but the initial position is where ""baba is you"" is. So I can move right, but I need to make sure I don't hit any walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and various up steps. So moving right 3 steps is safe.

So the first action is right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means right now, the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: key, is, win, wall, etc., spread out. The key is located 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. Hmm, that's interesting. So the key is just below me, but maybe there's a wall or something blocking the way.

Wait, the key is at (left 1, down 1). So if I move left once and down once, I should reach it. But I need to check if there are any walls or other obstacles in that path. Let me visualize the map.

I'm at the starting position. To my right, there are walls and rule blocks. The key is to the left and down. So maybe I can move left first. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall or an immovable object.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So that's somewhere above me. I don't think that affects me right now. The walls are mostly to the right, so moving left might be clear.

Let me think about the rules. Since ""key is win"" is active, I just need to reach the key. But maybe there's a way to change the rules to make it easier. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could just pick up the key by moving into it. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to create a new rule. For instance, if I can move the ""win"" rule block next to something else, I could change what wins. But right now, the key is the win condition, so I just need to get to it.

Looking at the key's position, it's 1 step left and 1 step down. So if I move left once, I'll be directly above the key. Then moving down should take me to the key. But I need to check if there's a wall in that spot.

Wait, the wall is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So that's to the right, not in the path to the key. So moving left and then down should be possible.

Let me plan the steps. First, move left once to get to the position above the key. Then move down once to reach the key. That should trigger the win condition.

But wait, am I allowed to move into the key? Since ""key is win,"" moving into it should end the level. So yes, that should work.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first and then left, but that might take me into a wall. Let me check. If I move down once, I'm at (current x, y-1). Then moving left once would take me to (x-1, y-1), which is the key's position. So that works too.

Either way, moving left and down in some order should get me to the key. Since the key is just one step away in both directions, it's straightforward.

I don't see any immediate obstacles in that path, so I think moving left first is the way to go. Then I can move down to win.
</think>

To win, move left to align above the key, then down to reach it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means right now, the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. My goal is to get to the key to win the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall four steps to the right and four steps up. Then there are several rule blocks: key, is, win, wall, stop, and others. The key is one step down from my current position, which is good because it's nearby. But I need to figure out how to get to it without being blocked by walls or other rules.

Wait, the key is one step down. So if I move down, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking me. Let me check the walls. There's a wall four steps to the right and four steps up, but that's probably not in my way. The walls at four steps right and 3, 2, 1 steps up, and four steps right—those are all to the right, so maybe they form a vertical line. But I'm moving down, so maybe I can go around.

Wait, the key is one step down. So if I move down, I should be able to get to it. But I need to make sure that moving down isn't blocked. Let me see if there's a wall one step down. The observation says there's a wall four steps to the right and one step down. So that's not directly below me. So moving down should be possible.

But wait, the active rule is ""key is win,"" so when I reach the key, I win. So moving down should be the way to go. But I should also check if there are any other rules that might affect me. For example, if there's a ""stop"" rule nearby, it might prevent me from moving. The stop rule is three steps to the right and two steps up. That's not directly in my path if I move down, so I should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, I might have a clearer path. But that might complicate things. Since the key is right below me, maybe it's simpler to just move down.

Wait, but in the previous observations, the key was one step down, and now it's still one step down. So I think moving down is the right move. Let me try that.
