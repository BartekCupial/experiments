Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""baba is you."" That means walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and two up. Then, there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""is"" rule six steps right and two up, a ""win"" rule seven steps right and two up, and a ""wall"" rule two steps left and one up. There's also a ""stop"" rule one step up, which probably means that whatever is under that rule is stoppable.

I notice a door six steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, so I should look for a key. There's a key five steps right and two down. To get to the key, I might need to move down, but I have to check if there are walls blocking the way. There are walls two steps right and one down, two steps right, and two steps right and two down. So, moving right two steps and down might be possible, but I need to see if I can get past those walls.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, so I can't move through walls. So, I need to find a way to change that rule or find a path that doesn't require moving through walls.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""ball"" rule four steps right. Maybe I can use that somehow, but I'm not sure yet. There's also a ""key"" rule seven steps right and two down, which is near the key. Maybe I can manipulate that.

I see a ""baba"" rule three steps left and four down, an ""is"" rule two steps left and four down, and a ""you"" rule one step left and four down. That seems like a potential new rule I can create by moving those blocks. If I can move the ""baba"" block to the left, maybe I can form a new rule like ""baba is key"" or something else useful.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key to open the door. To do that, I might need to change the rules so that I can move through walls or make the key accessible. Alternatively, I could change what ""you"" is, so that I can move differently.

First, I should move towards the rule blocks to see if I can rearrange them. The ""is"" rule is six steps right and two up, and the ""win"" rule is next to it. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to the left to create a new rule. If I can get the ""baba"" block to the left, I can combine it with the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks to make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe I can make ""baba is key"" by moving the ""key"" rule somewhere else.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is seven steps right and two down, which is near the key. If I can move the ""key"" rule to the left, I might be able to create a new rule that makes the key something else, or perhaps make the key into a different object.

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to try to move the ""baba"" rule to the left to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass"" or something, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Alternatively, I can try to change the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is one step up. If I can move that, I can change what is stoppable. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to be under a different subject, like ""key is stop,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can remove the ""stop"" from walls, then walls won't block me anymore.

So, maybe I should move the ""stop"" rule. But how? I can only move text blocks that are not defined as ""stop."" Since the ""stop"" rule is a text block, I can move it. So, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, which would remove the ""wall is stop"" rule because the ""stop"" block is no longer connected to ""wall.""

Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop,"" which is formed by the ""wall"" rule two steps left and one up, the ""is"" rule one step left and one up, and the ""stop"" rule one step up. So, if I move the ""stop"" rule, the ""wall is stop"" rule will be broken, meaning walls won't stop me anymore. That could be useful.

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule. But to do that, I need to get to it. It's one step up from my current position. So, I can move up once to reach it. Then, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, like down or to the side, which would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, I can move through walls. That would allow me to reach the key, which is behind walls. So, moving up to get the ""stop"" rule seems like a good first step.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to the left to create a new rule, but I think breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule is more straightforward.

So, the first action I should take is to move up to reach the ""stop"" rule. That way, I can pick it up and move it elsewhere, allowing me to pass through walls.
</think>

To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I'll move up to pick up the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. From the observation, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

First, I notice there are walls around me. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and down. There's also a door 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Doors usually require keys to open, so I should look for a key. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and there's a ""rule `key`"" nearby, which might mean the key is defined as something else, but I'm not sure yet.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step up. Since ""stop"" is a property that makes objects immovable, I should be cautious about moving that rule unless I want to change something. The walls are defined as ""stop,"" so they can't be moved unless I change the rules.

To reach the key, I need to move right and down. Let me plan the path: from my current position, moving right twice would take me past the initial walls. Then, moving down a couple of steps would get me closer to the key. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my way.

Wait, the walls are at 2 steps right and 1 step up, 2 right, 2 right and 1 down, etc. So moving right twice would take me to the position where the wall is at 2 right and 1 up, but since I'm moving down, maybe that's not a problem. Let me visualize the grid.

I think the best approach is to move right twice to get past the initial walls. That should open up the path towards the key and the door. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed to the win condition.

So, the first step is to move right twice. But since each action is a single step, I need to choose the right direction each time. The first move should be right, then right again in the next step. But since I can only choose one action now, I'll start with moving right.
</think>

To progress towards the key and the win condition, moving right is the first step to bypass the initial walls.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

First, I notice there are walls around me. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and down. There's also a ""rule `stop`"" one step to the left and up, which might be a wall or an obstacle. I can't move through walls because the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, so I need to find a way around them.

I see a ""rule `ball`"" 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can use that somehow, but I'm not sure yet. There's also a door 5 steps to the right and 1 step down, which might require a key. The key is located 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. So, to open the door, I probably need to get the key first.

But wait, the door is in the way to the win condition. So maybe I need to go around or find another path. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the rules to change the door or the key's properties.

Looking at the rules, I see ""baba is you"" is the only active rule. There are other rule fragments like ""rule `stop`,"" ""rule `is`,"" ""rule `wall`,"" etc. Maybe I can move these to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""rule `stop`"" next to ""wall,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which is already the case, but perhaps rearranging other rules could help.

I also see ""rule `baba`"" 4 steps to the left and 5 steps down, ""rule `is`"" 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down, and ""rule `you`"" 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. If I can move these to form a new rule like ""baba is key"" or something, that might let me pick up the key or change my properties.

But right now, I'm at the starting position. I need to move towards the win. Let me plan the path. To the right, there's a wall one step to the right and up, so I can't go up. Maybe I should go down first to avoid the walls.

If I move right once, I can go down. Let me try moving right to step into the space where the wall isn't blocking me. Then, moving down might let me bypass the walls above.

Wait, the wall is at 1 step right and 1 step up, so if I move right, I can go down without hitting the wall. So, moving right first, then down could be the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left, but there's a ""rule `stop`"" one step left and up, which might be a wall. I'm not sure if that's passable. It's safer to go right and down.

So, my first move should be to the right. That way, I can start moving towards the key and door, which are to the right and down. Once I get past the initial walls, I can work on getting the key and opening the door to reach the win condition.

I think moving right is the best first step to start progressing towards the goal.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I should check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, the win condition is there. I need to figure out how to get to it.

First, I should note the other rules and objects. There's a ""rule `stop`"" two steps to the left and one step up. That probably means that wherever the ""stop"" rule is, those objects can't be moved. I should avoid moving those unless I can change the rules.

There's a ""rule `wall`"" four steps to the left. So, walls are stop objects, meaning I can't move through them. I need to be careful about walls blocking my path.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" two steps to the right and one step down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's something I can use or avoid.

The door is at four steps to the right and one step down. Doors usually require a key to open, so I should look for a key. There's a ""key"" at three steps to the right and three steps down, and a ""rule `key`"" five steps to the right and three steps down. So, the key is somewhere below me, and I might need to get it to open the door.

The ""rule `baba`"" is five steps to the left and five steps down, and ""rule `is`"" is four steps to the left and five steps down, and ""rule `you`"" is three steps to the left and five steps down. These might be part of the rules that define Baba, but I'm not sure how they affect me yet.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls at different positions. I need to make sure I don't try to move through them. The walls are at 1 step up, 1 step down, 2 steps down, 3 steps down, 4 steps down, and 5 steps down, all one step to the right. So, the right side has walls from up to down, which might block my path if I go right.

The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the left and one step up. So, if I move left two steps and up one, I'll hit a stop object, which I can't move. I should avoid that unless I can change the rule.

My current position is where Baba is, which is probably the starting point. I need to figure out how to move towards the win condition. The win is five steps to the right and one step up. That's quite far to the right, but there are walls on the right side, so I might need to go around.

Wait, the door is at four steps to the right and one step down. If I can get the key, I can open the door and maybe reach the win. The key is three steps to the right and three steps down. So, I need to go down to get the key, then back up to the door.

But I have to be careful about the walls. Let me visualize the map. Starting from Baba, moving right, there are walls at each step down, so going straight right might not be possible. Maybe I need to go down first to avoid the walls.

If I move down, I can go around the walls. Let me try moving down. From my current position, moving down once would take me to the position where there's a wall one step down. Oh, that's a wall, so I can't move there because walls are stop objects. So, I can't move down directly.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule or the ""wall"" rule, I might be able to make the walls passable. But how?

Looking at the rules, the active ones are ""baba is you"" and ""wall is stop."" So, walls are stop, meaning I can't move through them. If I can change the wall's property, maybe I can make them not stop.

To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. The ""rule `wall`"" is four steps to the left. So, if I can move that rule, I can change what walls are. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me.

But to move the rule, I need to get to it. The ""rule `wall`"" is four steps to the left. So, I need to move left four times. But wait, moving left from my current position, I might hit the ""rule `stop`"" which is two steps to the left and one step up. If I move left two steps and up one, I'll hit the stop rule, which I can't move through.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first to avoid the stop rule. Let me see: if I move down, but the first step down is a wall, which I can't pass. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the left and one step up. So, if I move up one step, I can then move left two steps to reach the ""rule `stop`."" But moving up from my current position, is there a wall? The wall is one step up, so moving up would take me to the wall, which is a stop. I can't move there.

So, I can't move up because of the wall. I can't move right because of the walls on the right. I can't move down because of the wall one step down. The only option is to move left, but moving left two steps and up one would hit the stop rule.

Wait, maybe I can move left first. Let me try moving left once. From my current position, moving left once would take me to the position where the ""rule `is`"" is, which is three steps to the left. Wait, no, the ""rule `is`"" is three steps to the left, but I'm moving left once. So, I'm moving towards the left, but I need to see if there's a wall or stop in that path.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the left and one step up. So, if I move left two steps, I'm at the position where the stop rule is, but one step up. So, moving left two steps and up one would take me to the stop rule, which I can't move through.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left and then down. Let me see: moving left once, then down once. But moving down from the left position, is there a wall? The walls are on the right side, so maybe the left side is clear. Let me check the objects on the map again.

The walls are at 1 step up, 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc., all one step to the right. So, the left side might be clear. So, moving left once, then down once might be possible.

Wait, but moving left once from my current position, I'm at the position where the ""rule `is`"" is, which is three steps to the left. No, that's not right. The ""rule `is`"" is three steps to the left, but I'm moving left once, so I'm just one step left. There's no wall there, so I can move left once.

Then, from there, moving down once would take me to the position one step left and one step down. Is there a wall there? The walls are on the right side, so probably not. So, I can move left once, then down once to get around the wall.

Once I'm down there, I can move left further to reach the ""rule `wall`"" which is four steps to the left. So, moving left three more times from my current position after moving left once and down once would take me to the ""rule `wall`.""

Wait, no. Let me recount. My current position is where Baba is. Moving left once takes me to position (x-1, y). Then moving down once takes me to (x-1, y-1). From there, I can move left three more times to reach (x-4, y-1), which is where the ""rule `wall`"" is.

So, the plan is: move left once, then down once, then left three times to reach the ""rule `wall`."" Then, I can move the ""rule `wall`"" to change the wall's property.

But wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is four steps to the left, so I need to move left four times from my current position. But moving left four times directly would take me to (x-4, y). But there's a ""rule `stop`"" two steps to the left and one step up, so I need to avoid that.

Alternatively, moving left once, then down once, then left three times would take me to (x-4, y-1), which is below the ""rule `stop`."" So, I can safely reach the ""rule `wall`"" without hitting the stop rule.

Once I'm at the ""rule `wall`,"" I can move it to change the rule. For example, I can move it to make ""wall is not stop,"" which would allow me to pass through walls. Or, I can move it to make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls.

But I need to think about what's the best way to proceed. If I make walls not stop, I can move through them, which would help me reach the win condition. Alternatively, if I make walls pushable, I can move them out of the way.

But changing the rule might have unintended consequences. Let me think: if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me, which would allow me to move through them. That would be helpful because the right side is blocked by walls.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left once.
2. Move down once.
3. Move left three times to reach the ""rule `wall`.""
4. Move the ""rule `wall`"" to change the rule.

But wait, how do I move the rule? I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" text block. So, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else. For example, I can move it to make ""wall is not stop.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" to a position where it forms a new rule. So, I can move it next to another word to create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can break the existing rule by moving one of the words. For example, moving ""wall"" away from ""is"" and ""stop"" would remove the rule, but that might not be helpful.

Wait, the current rule is ""wall is stop."" If I move the ""stop"" part away, the rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be stop. So, that would achieve the same effect as changing the rule.

So, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall is"" part.

The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the left and one step up. So, if I can move the ""stop"" word, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to get to it. The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the left and one step up. So, from my current position, moving left two steps and up one would take me there. But moving up from my current position is blocked by a wall one step up.

So, I can't reach the ""stop"" rule directly because of the wall. That's why I need to go around by moving left and down first.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left once.
2. Move down once.
3. Move left three times to reach the ""rule `wall`"" at four steps to the left.
4. From there, move up to reach the ""rule `stop`"" which is two steps to the left and one step up from my current position.

Wait, no. The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the left and one step up from the starting position, not from where I am after moving left and down.

So, after moving left once and down once, I'm at (x-1, y-1). The ""rule `stop`"" is at (x-2, y+1). So, to get there from my current position, I need to move left one more step and up two steps. But moving up from (x-1, y-1) would take me to (x-1, y), which is where I started, but there's a wall one step up, so I can't move up.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" to a more accessible location. The ""rule `win`"" is five steps to the right and one step up. If I can move it closer, I can reach it without going through the walls.

But to move the ""rule `win`,"" I need to get to it. It's five steps to the right and one step up, which is blocked by walls on the right. So, I can't reach it directly.

Wait, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make something else the win condition, I might be able to win without reaching the current ""win"" object.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" at three steps to the right and three steps down. If I can make the key the win condition, then picking up the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to create a rule like ""key is win."" So, I can move the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule to form ""key is win.""

The ""rule `key`"" is five steps to the right and three steps down. The ""rule `win`"" is five steps to the right and one step up. So, if I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is, I can form ""key is win.""

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to get to it. It's five steps to the right and one step up, which is blocked by walls. So, I can't reach it directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up to where the ""win"" rule is. The ""key"" rule is five steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move it up four steps, it would be at five steps to the right and one step up, same as the ""win"" rule. Then, I can form ""key is win.""

But moving the ""key"" rule requires getting to it, which is five steps to the right and three steps down. That's blocked by walls on the right, so I can't reach it.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think about the door. The door is at four steps to the right and one step down. If I can open the door, maybe I can reach the win condition through there.

To open the door, I need the key, which is three steps to the right and three steps down. So, I need to get the key first. But to get the key, I have to go down, which is blocked by walls on the right.

Wait, maybe I can go around the walls by moving left and then down. Let me try:

1. Move left once.
2. Move down once.
3. Move right four times to reach the key at three steps to the right and three steps down.

Wait, no. From (x-1, y-1), moving right four times would take me to (x+3, y-1). The key is at (x+3, y-3). So, I need to move down two more steps.

But moving down from (x+3, y-1) would take me to (x+3, y-2) and (x+3, y-3), where the key is. But are there walls there? The walls are on the right side, so at (x+1, y-1), (x+1, y-2), etc. So, moving right to (x+3, y-1) is possible because there's no wall there.

Wait, the walls are at 1 step to the right and various y positions. So, moving right beyond that is possible. So, from (x-1, y-1), moving right four times would take me to (x+3, y-1), then moving down two times to (x+3, y-3), where the key is.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left once.
2. Move down once.
3. Move right four times.
4. Move down two times to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can go back to the door at four steps to the right and one step down. So, from the key's position (x+3, y-3), moving up two times would take me to (x+3, y-1), then moving right one more step to (x+4, y-1), which is the door.

But wait, the door is at four steps to the right and one step down from the starting position, which is (x+4, y-1). So, yes, that's correct.

Once I open the door, I can move through it. But what's behind the door? I'm not sure, but maybe it leads to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe after opening the door, I can reach the win condition through there.

But I need to make sure I can move through the door. Doors usually require the key to be picked up, so once I have the key, I can open the door.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left once.
2. Move down once.
3. Move right four times.
4. Move down two times to get the key.
5. Move up two times.
6. Move right one step to the door.
7. Move through the door.
8. Then, proceed to the win condition.

But wait, after getting the key, I need to go back up to the door. So, from (x+3, y-3), moving up two times takes me to (x+3, y-1), then moving right one step to (x+4, y-1), which is the door.

Once I open the door, I can move through it. Then, I need to find the win condition. The win is at five steps to the right and one step up, which is (x+5, y+1). So, from the door, I can move right one more step to (x+5, y-1), then up two steps to (x+5, y+1), which is the win.

But wait, moving up","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `win`"" at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. So that's the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map.

First, I should note the other rules. There's a ""rule `stop`"" which is 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. That probably means that wherever the ""stop"" rule is, it's making something immovable. Also, there are several walls and other rules scattered around.

I see a ""rule `wall`"" at 4 steps to the left. That might mean that the wall is defined by that rule. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what's considered a wall. But I'm not sure yet.

There's a ""rule `key`"" at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. And a key is at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need the key to open a door. The door is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So perhaps I need to get the key to open the door to reach the win.

But how do I get to the key? Let me see the path. From my starting position, I can move right. There's a wall 1 step up, but I'm not sure if that's blocking me. Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move unless something is stopping me.

I think I should try moving right first. If I move right, I might get closer to the door and the key. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. That probably means the win condition is at that position. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls around me. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and right, and some below me. The ""rule `stop`"" is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might be a wall or an obstacle that stops movement. I should avoid that.

There's also a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. I'm not sure what that does yet, but maybe it's a movable object or something that can be used to change rules.

The door is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Doors usually require keys to open, so I should look for a key. The key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That might mean the key is at that position, and I can pick it up to open the door.

But before I can get to the key, I need to navigate through the walls. Let me see if I can move around them. Since I'm Baba, I can move through the map unless there are walls blocking me. The walls are at 1 step to the left, 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and so on. It seems like the path to the right is more open, so maybe I should move right.

I also see a ""rule `wall`"" 5 steps to the left. That might mean that the wall rule is defined there, but I'm not sure how that affects me yet. Maybe if I can move the wall rule, I can change the properties of walls, making them passable.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another ""rule `is`"" is 4 steps to the left. These are probably the rule blocks that I can move to create new rules. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can change the rules of the game.

For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule like ""stop is something,"" which could make the stop rule affect other objects.

But right now, my main goal is to reach the win condition. Let me plan my path. I need to move right to get past the initial walls. Let's see:

1. Move right to get past the wall on the right.
2. Then, move down to reach the door.
3. But the door is blocked by walls, so I might need to find a way to remove or bypass them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties of the walls, making them passable. If I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them.

Looking at the ""rule `wall`"" 5 steps to the left, if I can move that rule, I might be able to redefine what walls are. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become passable since I can move through them as Baba.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should first try to reach the key to open the door. The key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. To get there, I need to move right and then down, but there are walls in the way.

Wait, the ""rule `ball`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe the ball can be used to break through walls or change the environment. If I can move the ball into a wall, perhaps it will break the wall, creating a path.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I might be able to change the ball's properties. For example, ""ball is key"" would make the ball act as a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the actual key.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around. The other rules are ""stop is something,"" ""wall is stop,"" etc. I need to find a way to change these rules to my advantage.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule to create a new rule like ""stop is win,"" which would make the stop block the win condition. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I might be able to change the win condition to something else, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can reach that position, I can win the level. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to redefine the walls as passable.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. If I can create a rule like ""wall is you,"" then walls would become passable since I can move through them as Baba. That would allow me to walk through the walls and reach the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position to next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ""rule `wall`"" is 5 steps to the left. So I need to move the ""is"" rule left to reach the ""wall"" rule.

But moving the ""is"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it and then move it. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to navigate through the walls. Maybe I can first move right to get past the initial walls, then move up or down to reach the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""is"" rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is 5 steps to the left, so I need to move it right to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. That might be a longer path, but it's possible.

Once I've created the ""wall is you"" rule, the walls will no longer stop me, and I can move through them to reach the win condition.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right to get past the initial walls.
2. Move up or down as needed to reach the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is you.""
4. Once walls are passable, move through them to reach the win condition.

Let me start by moving right to get past the walls. The first wall is 1 step to the left and 1 step up, but I'm at the starting position, so moving right should take me away from it.

I'll move right once to get past the immediate wall. Now, I'm at a position where I can see more of the map. Next, I'll move up to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.

Wait, moving up might not be the best idea because there's a ""rule `stop`"" 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. I don't want to trigger that. Maybe I should move down instead.

Looking down, I see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can use the ball to help me. If I can move the ball into a wall, it might break the wall, creating a path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to redefine the walls. Let me focus on that.

I'll move right again to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Now, I'm at 2 steps to the right. Next, I'll move up to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.

Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can move it left to reach the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is 5 steps to the left, so I need to move the ""is"" rule left multiple times.

After moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, the new rule ""wall is you"" will take effect, making walls passable.

Now, I can move through the walls. I'll move down to reach the door, but it's blocked by walls. Since walls are now passable, I can walk through them to get to the door.

But wait, the door requires a key. The key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. I need to get the key first. Let me adjust my plan:

1. Move right to get past the initial walls.
2. Move up to reach the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""is"" rule left to redefine walls as passable.
4. Move down through the walls to reach the key.
5. Pick up the key.
6. Move right to the door and use the key to open it.
7. Proceed to the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can redefine the ball as a key, I might not need to get the actual key. Let me see if that's possible.

The ""rule `ball`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to the key, I can create a rule like ""ball is key,"" which would allow me to use the ball to open the door.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's simpler to just redefine the walls and get the key normally.

I think the best approach is to redefine the walls as passable so I can move through them and reach the key and the win condition.

So, I'll proceed with moving the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is you."" Once that's done, I can move through the walls, get the key, open the door, and win the level.

Let me start by moving right to get past the initial walls. Then, I'll move up to reach the ""is"" rule and move it left to redefine the walls.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, the win condition is there. But to get there, I might need to manipulate some rules or move objects.

I also notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. That probably means that whatever is defined as ""stop"" will block movement. There are several walls around, which are likely ""stop"" objects because of the rule ""wall is stop."" So, walls are immovable and block my path.

There's a door 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Doors usually require a key to open. I see a ""key"" 1 step to the right and 3 steps down, and a ""rule `key`"" 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can get the key to open the door.

But wait, how do I get to the key? There are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them. Alternatively, I could move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange these to create new rules. For instance, if I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules next to the key, I could make the key into something else, like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition.

But first, I need to get to the key. Let me plan the path. From my current position, I can move right twice to get past the initial walls. Then, moving down, I can approach the door. But the door is closed, so I need the key. To get the key, I might need to go further down.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. So, from my starting point, moving right twice and then down three times should get me near the key. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move some ""is"" or ""you"" rules to change the properties of the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make myself into a different object. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key or interact with it differently. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, then the walls won't block me anymore. So, I could move the ""rule `stop`"" somewhere else, making the walls passable. That would allow me to move through them and reach the key.

Let me try that. The ""rule `stop`"" is 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move it to a different location, maybe I can make the walls not stop. But how do I move it? I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. Since I'm Baba, I can move it if it's not defined as stop. Wait, but the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, so the walls are stop, but the rule blocks themselves might not be stop unless defined.

Hmm, maybe the rule blocks are movable. So, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" and ""wall"" rules to create a new rule like ""wall is not stop.""

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is 6 steps to the left. If I can move that, I could redefine what wall is. For example, moving ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""not stop"" to make ""wall is not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls. If I move the ""rule `stop`"" block, then the walls won't be stop anymore. So, I can move it to a different location, perhaps next to something else or just out of the way.

But how do I move it? I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. Since I'm Baba, I can move it if it's not defined as stop. Wait, but the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, so walls are stop, but the rule blocks themselves might not be stop unless defined. So, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule block. It's 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. So, from my current position, I can move left four times and up once to reach it. But that might take a while, and I'm not sure if it's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" and ""you"" next to the key. For example, making ""key is you"" would allow me to switch into the key, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. So, if I can get there, I can pick up the key and then open the door. The door is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, after getting the key, I can go back up and open the door to reach the win condition.

But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the wall to change its property. For example, making ""wall is not stop"" would allow me to pass through. But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not work.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls. If I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block to a different location, then the walls won't be stop anymore. So, I can move it to a place where it doesn't affect the walls.

Let me try that. I'll move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location. It's 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. So, I'll move left four times and up once to get there. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like down or right, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once the walls are no longer stop, I can move through them and reach the key. Then, with the key, I can open the door and reach the win condition.

So, my plan is:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule block.
2. Move it to a different location to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Move through the walls to reach the key.
4. Pick up the key.
5. Open the door.
6. Reach the win condition.

Let me start by moving left four times and up once to get to the ""stop"" rule block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map.

Looking at the objects, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map.

There are walls around, and some other rules like ""rule `stop`"" which is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. I should avoid moving into walls because they are ""stop"" objects, meaning I can't pass through them. 

I also notice a ""rule `key`"" and a ""key"" object. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed further.

But wait, how do I get the key? The key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. To reach it, I might need to move down, but there are walls in the way. Let me see the path: from my current position, moving right a few times and then down might get me there, but I have to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""rule `stop`"" somewhere else, I could create a path. Or perhaps I can change the rules to make walls passable.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is 5 steps to the left. If I can move that rule, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. For instance, if I make ""wall is push"" or something, I could push the walls out of the way.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. My main goal is to reach the win condition. The win rule is 4 steps right and 1 step up. So, if I can move right four times and up once, I might reach it. But are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the map, the walls are positioned in such a way that moving right might be blocked. Maybe I need to find a way around. Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me by manipulating the rules.

Wait, another idea: if I can make myself into a different object, like a ""key"" or ""ball,"" I might be able to interact with the door or other objects differently. For example, if I can change the rule to ""baba is key,"" then I could open the door without needing the key object.

But how do I change the rules? I need to move the text blocks. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered around. If I can move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is key.""

Let me see where the ""rule `is`"" blocks are. There's one 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, another 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and others further down. Maybe I can move one of these closer to ""baba"" and ""key.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `key`"" next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to create ""baba is key."" That would allow me to pick up the key or interact with the door.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should first try to reach the key and then the door. Let me plan the path: from my current position, moving right three times and then down three times would get me to the key. But I have to check if the path is clear.

Wait, the walls are at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, 2 steps to the left and 1 step up, etc. So moving right might be possible. Let me try to move right step by step and see if I can navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Moving up once would take me to where the ""rule `stop`"" is. But that's a stop rule, so I can't move into it. So moving up isn't an option.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules first before moving. Let me see if I can move any rule blocks to change the game mechanics.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are key to creating new rules. If I can move one next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I can make ""baba is key."" That would allow me to interact with the door.

So, let's try to move the ""rule `is`"" that's 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move it down to where ""baba"" and ""key"" are, I can create the new rule.

But how do I move the ""rule `is`""? I need to move it by pushing or pulling. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can only push or pull objects that are not ""stop."" So, I need to see if the ""rule `is`"" is movable.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is a text block, which I think can be moved. So, I can move it by pushing it into a new position. Let me plan to move right three times to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Then, I can push it down to create the new rule.

Once I've moved the ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" the rule ""baba is key"" will be active. Then, I can pick up the key and open the door.

After opening the door, I can proceed to the ""rule `win`"" and win the level.

So, the steps are:

1. Move right three times to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up.
2. Push the ""rule `is`"" down to create the rule ""baba is key.""
3. Now, as Baba, I can pick up the key located 2 steps right and 3 steps down.
4. With the key, I can open the door at 3 steps right and 1 step down.
5. Proceed through the door and move to the ""rule `win`"" to win the level.

I think this is a viable plan. Let me start by moving right to reach the ""rule `is`.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a door, a key, and some other elements. The key is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. The door is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's also a rule `key` at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Hmm, that might be important.

I notice that the door is in the way, and to open it, I probably need the key. So, my first thought is to get the key. But to get the key, I need to move right and down. However, there are walls in the way. Let me see the layout.

The walls are positioned at various points, but I can move around them if possible. The rule `stop` is 4 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might be a wall or an obstacle. The rule `wall` is 6 steps to the left, which probably defines walls as stop objects, meaning I can't move through them.

So, my plan is to move towards the key. I need to go right and down. Let me check the path. Starting from my current position, moving right would take me towards the door and the key. But there's a wall 2 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might block my path if I'm not careful.

Wait, maybe I should first move up to see if there's a clearer path. If I go up, I might find a way around the walls. Alternatively, moving left could help me rearrange some rules, but that might complicate things.

Another idea: if I can move the rule `key` closer, maybe I can change the key's properties. But I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule, like ""key is you,"" I could control the key, but that might not be necessary.

Let me focus on the immediate goal: getting to the key. I need to move right and down. Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I might reach the door, but without the key, I can't open it. So, I need to get the key first.

To get to the key, I need to move right and down. Let me check the steps. The key is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down from my current position. So, I need to move right once and down three times. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 2 steps to the left and 1 step up, which is above me. Another wall is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down, which is below me but to the left. So, moving right might be clear. Let me try moving right.

After moving right, I'm one step closer to the key. Now, I need to move down three times. Let me check each step. The first step down is clear. The second step down is also clear. The third step down is where the key is, so I should be able to reach it.

Once I have the key, I can then move towards the door. The door is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down from my current position. So, after getting the key, I can move right once more and down once to reach the door. Then, with the key, I can open the door and proceed to the win condition.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the door is defined as ""WIN"" or something similar. Let me check the active rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. The ""WIN"" rule is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, I need to reach that point.

Alternatively, maybe the door leads to the win condition. So, after opening the door, I can move into the next area where the win condition is.

I think the best course of action is to move right to start heading towards the key. That way, I can pick up the key and then proceed to open the door and reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a door, a key, and some other elements. The key is at 3 steps down, and the door is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. There's also a rule `key` at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Hmm, that might be important.

I notice that the door is in the way, and to open it, I probably need the key. So, my first thought is to get the key. But to reach the key, I need to move right a bit. Let me see the path. The key is at 3 steps down, so I need to move down three times. But wait, there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions.

The walls are at various positions, but I see that moving left or right might help me navigate around them. The rule `stop` is at 5 steps to the left and 1 step up, which probably means that the stop rule is applied to some objects, making them immovable. I need to be careful not to move into walls unless I can change the rules.

I also see a rule `ball` at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe that's a red herring, or maybe it can be used somehow. But right now, my main focus is on getting the key to open the door.

So, to get to the key, I need to move down three steps. Let me plan that. Starting from my current position, I can move down three times. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Looking at the walls, I see that at 3 steps down, there's a wall at 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, that's not directly in my path. I'm moving straight down, so maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right a bit to avoid the walls. Let me see. If I move right once, then down three times, I might reach the key without hitting a wall. But I need to check if the path is clear.

Wait, the door is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So, if I move right once and down once, I can reach the door. But the door is closed, so I need the key to open it. So, I need to get the key first.

The key is at 3 steps down. So, I need to move down three times. Let me try that. Starting from my current position, I'll move down, down, down. That should get me to the key. Once I have the key, I can go back to the door and open it.

But wait, after moving down three times, I might end up next to the key. Let me visualize the map. The key is at 3 steps down, so moving down three times from my starting point should place me at the same x-coordinate as the key. Then, I can move right or left to pick it up.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is at 1 step right and 1 step down from my starting position. So, after getting the key, I can move up twice to get back to the door's level, then move right once to reach the door. With the key, the door should open, allowing me to proceed further.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change the rules to make the walls passable or to make the door open without the key. But that might be more complicated. For now, the straightforward approach is to get the key and open the door.

So, the immediate action I need to take is to move down to reach the key. Let me choose the ""down"" action to start moving towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a door, a key, and other elements. The key is two steps down, and the door is one step to the right. There's also a ""rule `key`"" two steps to the right and two steps down. Hmm, that might be important.

I notice that the walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. The ""stop"" rule is five steps to the left and two steps up, which probably means that walls are stoppable. I can move around unless a wall is in my way.

I think the strategy here is to get the key to open the door. To do that, I need to move towards the key. The key is two steps down, so I should move down twice. But wait, I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. Let me check the positions again.

The walls are at various positions, but the key is two steps down, and there's a wall three steps to the left and two steps down. That might not directly block my path if I'm moving straight down. So, moving down twice should get me to the key.

Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is one step to the right. After opening the door, I can move towards the win condition, which is two steps to the right and two steps up. But I need to make sure that the door is open, so having the key is essential.

Wait, but how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can pick up objects by moving into them. So, moving down twice should allow me to pick up the key. Then, I can move right to the door and use the key to open it.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Move down twice to reach the key.
2. Pick up the key.
3. Move right to the door.
4. Use the key to open the door.
5. Move towards the win condition.

I think moving down twice is the first step. Let me check if there are any walls in that path. The walls are at 3 steps left and 2 steps down, but I'm moving straight down, so I should be okay. 

Alternatively, if moving down is blocked, I might need to adjust my path, but based on the current layout, moving down seems feasible. So, I'll choose to move down twice to get the key.

I think I need to get the key to open the door. But first, I need to figure out how to move. The walls are all around, so I have to find a path. The ""stop"" rule is at 5 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which probably means that wall is immovable. The ""wall"" rule is at 7 steps to the left and 2 steps up, so those walls are stoppers.

I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably where the Baba is. I need to move towards the key. Let me see the layout. The key is down one step, and the door is to the right and up. So maybe I can move down to get the key, then use it to open the door.

Wait, but there are walls blocking the way. Let me check the walls. There's a wall at 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up, another at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up, and so on. It seems like the left side is blocked, so I should focus on moving right or down.

I think the best path is to move down to get the key. So, I'll go down one step. That should let me pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can move right towards the door. The door is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so after getting the key, I can move up to open it.

But wait, there's a ""rule `key`"" at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe that's a rule I can change. If I move the ""key"" rule, I might be able to make the key do something else, but I'm not sure. For now, I'll focus on getting the key first.

So, my plan is to move down to get the key. Once I have it, I can proceed to the door. Let me try moving down.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a door, a key, and some other elements. The rules are defined by text blocks like ""rule `stop`"" or ""rule `win`."" These rules can be moved around to change the game's mechanics.

First, I need to figure out where everything is. The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That's probably a rule that makes something stop, so maybe it's attached to a wall or another object. The walls are scattered around, some with steps up and down, which might block my path or create barriers.

The ""rule `win`"" is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's where I need to get to win, I think. But to reach it, I might need to move some rules around or collect a key to open a door.

I see a ""door"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Doors usually require a key to open, so I should look for the key. The ""key"" is 2 steps to the right. So, if I can get to the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

But wait, there's a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. That might mean that the key has some special property, maybe it's needed to change a rule or to unlock something else.

I also notice a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

The ""rule `baba`"" is 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That might be a rule that defines Baba's properties, but since ""baba is you"" is already active, maybe I don't need to worry about that right now.

The ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" are also present, but I'm not sure how they factor into this level. Maybe they can be used to create new rules or modify existing ones.

I think the key steps are:
1. Move towards the key to collect it.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed towards the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move freely. Are there any walls or stop rules blocking my path? The walls are mostly on the left and down, so if I move right, I might have a clear path to the key and then to the win.

Let me plan my movements. Starting from my current position, I need to move right to reach the key. So, I'll go right a few times. Once I have the key, I can go back to the door and open it. Then, I can move up towards the win.

Wait, but the door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So after collecting the key, I need to go back up to the door. Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the door and win.

I'm a bit confused about the exact positions, but I think moving right is the first step. Let me try moving right to collect the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. But before I can get there, I need to figure out how to move through the level without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I also notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That probably means that wherever that rule is, it's stopping something. Maybe it's preventing me from moving in a certain direction or blocking a path. I need to see if I can move that rule or change it somehow.

There's a ""rule `wall`"" 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. That suggests that walls are defined as stop, so they block movement. I should be careful not to run into them unless I can change their properties.

I see a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does, but maybe it's something I can use to my advantage. Perhaps it can be moved or used to break through walls.

The ""door"" is 2 steps up. Doors usually require a key to open, so I need to find the key. The ""key"" is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That might mean that the key is defined in a certain way, maybe as a tool I can pick up.

I also notice a ""rule `baba`"" 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That could be defining Baba's properties, but since ""baba is you"" is already active, I might not need to change that unless I want to alter my own properties.

The ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" are also present, which are part of the active rules. I might need to rearrange these to create new rules or modify existing ones to help me reach the win condition.

So, my plan is to first move towards the key since I need it to open the door. The key is 1 step to the left, so I'll move left. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is 2 steps up. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up.

But wait, I need to make sure that the path is clear. There are walls in the way, so I might need to move some rules to change the properties of the walls or other objects. For example, if I can make the walls not stop, I can walk through them. Alternatively, I could use the ball to break through walls if that's possible.

I should also be cautious of the ""rule `stop`"" since it might be preventing me from moving in a certain direction. If I can move that rule or change it, I might be able to bypass any obstacles it's causing.

Another thing to consider is whether I can redefine what ""WIN"" means. If I can change the win condition to something else, maybe I can win without reaching the current ""WIN"" object. But that might complicate things, so I'll focus on the straightforward approach first.

So, to summarize, I'll move left to get the key, then up to the door, and then proceed towards the win condition. If I encounter any walls or stops along the way, I'll try to manipulate the rules to overcome them.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a door, a key, and other things. The key is two steps to the right, and the door is one step to the right and two steps up. There's also a ""rule `key`"" two steps to the right and three steps down. Hmm, maybe I can use that to change the key's properties.

Wait, the door is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. To get to the door, I need to move right once and up twice. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls. There's a wall three steps to the left and one step up, another at three steps left and two steps up, and so on. It seems like the walls are blocking my path.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" five steps to the left and four steps up. Maybe if I can move that rule, I can make some walls stop being stop, allowing me to pass through. But how?

I think I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""wall"" rule away from ""is"" and ""stop,"" then walls won't be stop anymore, and I can walk through them. Let me see where the ""wall"" rule is. It's seven steps to the left and three steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can disconnect it from ""is"" and ""stop.""

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. If I move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make the key into something else, like ""key is you,"" which would let me pick it up. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the key is two steps to the right. If I can get to it, I can probably unlock the door. But the door is blocked by walls. So maybe I need to change the walls first.

Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule. If I can move it away, the walls won't be stop anymore. So I need to go to where the ""wall"" rule is. It's seven steps to the left and three steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can get there by moving left and up.

But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the layout again. The walls are at various positions, but I can't move through them if they're stop. So maybe I need to change the rule before moving.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is five steps to the left and four steps up. If I move it away, maybe the walls won't stop me. But I'm not sure how that works.

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule first. Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the ""wall"" rule at seven steps left and three up. So I'll move left seven times and up three times. But that's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls along the way.

Wait, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" part. If I can separate them, the rule will be broken, and walls won't stop me anymore. So maybe I don't need to go all the way to the ""wall"" rule but just move one part of it.

Looking back, the ""wall"" rule is at seven left and three up, and the ""is"" is at six left and three up. If I move the ""wall"" part one step right, it will be next to ""is,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" part away could break the rule.

I think the best approach is to move the ""wall"" rule so that it's no longer connected to ""is"" and ""stop."" That way, walls won't block me. So I'll move the ""wall"" rule to a different location, breaking the rule.

Once the walls are passable, I can move towards the key and then the door. The key is two steps right, so after getting through the walls, I can move right twice to pick it up. Then, with the key, I can open the door, which is one step right and two up.

But wait, the door is at 1 right and 2 up, but there are walls there. If I can pass through walls, I can get to the door. Then, using the key, I can open it and reach the win condition.

So, to summarize, my plan is:

1. Move the ""wall"" rule to break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.
2. Move through the walls to reach the key.
3. Pick up the key.
4. Use the key to open the door.
5. Proceed to the win condition.

I think the first step is crucial. I need to move the ""wall"" rule. Let me see how to do that. I'll need to move left seven times and up three times to get to it. But that's a lot, and I might get blocked by walls. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" part of the rule. The ""is"" is at six left and three up. If I move that, the rule ""wall is stop"" will be broken. So moving the ""is"" one step right would disconnect it from ""wall"" and ""stop.""

Yes, that makes sense. So I'll move the ""is"" rule one step right, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, walls won't block me anymore.

Once that's done, I can move freely through the walls. Then, I can go to the key, pick it up, and open the door to win.

So, the first action I need to take is to move the ""is"" rule one step right. That should break the wall's stop property.

Wait, but how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it by moving the text block. So I need to move the ""is"" that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. It's at six left and three up. If I move it right once, it will be at five left and three up, disconnecting it from ""wall"" and ""stop.""

Yes, that should work. So my first move is to move the ""is"" rule one step to the right.

But wait, in the game, you can only move one block at a time. So I need to plan my path to get to the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is five left and four up. If I move it down, it will no longer be connected to ""wall"" and ""is,"" breaking the rule.

Hmm, that might be easier. Let me see. The ""stop"" rule is five left and four up. If I move it down once, it will be five left and three up, which is where the ""is"" rule is. That might not help. Alternatively, moving it left or right.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall is"" part, the rule will be broken. So moving it left or right would disconnect it.

I think moving the ""stop"" rule one step left would make it six left and four up, which is where the ""is"" rule is. That might not help. Maybe moving it up or down.

Alternatively, moving the ""stop"" rule down once would make it five left and three up, which is where the ""is"" rule is. That might cause a new rule, which I don't want.

Hmm, maybe moving the ""is"" rule is better. Let me try that.

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule at six left and three up to five left and three up. That would disconnect it from ""wall"" and ""stop,"" breaking the rule.

Once that's done, walls won't stop me, and I can move through them.

So, my first action is to move the ""is"" rule one step to the right.

But wait, how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" text block. So I need to move it from six left and three up to five left and three up.

Yes, that should break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

After that, I can move through walls. Then, I can go to the key, which is two steps to the right. So I'll move right twice to pick it up.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is one step right and two up. So I'll move right once and up twice.

But wait, the door is at one right and two up, but there are walls there. If I can pass through walls, I can get to the door.

Once I'm at the door, I can use the key to open it, and then proceed to the win condition.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule one step right to break ""wall is stop.""
2. Move through walls to reach the key.
3. Pick up the key.
4. Move to the door and open it.
5. Proceed to win.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, let's execute the first step: moving the ""is"" rule one step to the right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a door, a key, and some other elements. The key is at 1 step to the left, and the rule `key` is 1 step to the right. There's also a door 2 steps up. Hmm, maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible. The rule `stop` is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which probably means that object is immovable. I should avoid moving into it.

I notice that the door is 2 steps up, so if I can get to it, maybe I can go through it to reach the win condition. But to open the door, I might need the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left to pick it up.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. The walls are on the left, so moving left might be blocked. Maybe I need to move up first to get around the walls. Alternatively, I can move right to see if there's a path.

The rule `is` is at 4 steps up, which might be part of another rule. Maybe I can manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks. But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can't change that right now. I need to focus on moving to get the key and open the door.

So, the plan is: move left to get the key, then move up to the door and use the key to open it. Once the door is open, I can proceed to the win condition.

But wait, the key is 1 step to the left, and I'm at the starting point. If I move left, will I hit a wall? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, but that's not directly in my path. The immediate left might be clear.

Alternatively, moving up first could be better to avoid walls. Let me try moving up to see if that path is clear. If I move up, I can then move left towards the key.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up, so moving up twice would get me to the door. But I need the key to open it. So maybe I should first move left to get the key, then up to the door.

Let me try moving left. If I move left once, I should reach the key. Then, I can move up twice to the door and use the key. Once the door is open, I can proceed to the win condition.

Alternatively, if moving left is blocked by a wall, I might need to find another path. But according to the map, the walls are on the left but not directly in the path of the key. So moving left should be possible.

So, the action I should take is to move left to pick up the key. That way, I can then proceed to the door and open it to reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and right, up and down. There's also a ""rule `stop`"" which might be an immovable object. I need to avoid that or see if I can move it.

There's a door 2 steps up, which might require a key. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the key to open the door.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Not sure what that does yet. Maybe it's a movable object or a rule I can change.

My current position is where Baba is, which is probably near the center. I need to move towards the win condition. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move towards the key to pick it up.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed towards the win condition, avoiding walls and stop rules.

Wait, but I can only move in four directions or idle. I need to make sure each move gets me closer without hitting a wall or stop.

Let me visualize the map. The win is to the right and up. The door is directly up, so I need to go up first, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" rules to create a new path. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that might block certain paths, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that might help. But I need to see if I can move the text blocks.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is an object I can move if it's not defined as stop. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but can I move the rule objects?

In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks if they're not defined as stop. So, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer or change the rules to make the win condition easier.

But maybe it's simpler to just move towards the win. Let me try moving up first to see if I can get past the door.

If I move up, I might hit a wall. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is where the win is. So, the win is behind a wall. I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall. If I can move the wall to the side, I can create a path. But how?

I can try moving left or right to find a gap. Let me see the walls:

- wall 3 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 3 step to the left
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step down
- wall 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
- wall 3 step to the left and 3 steps down
- wall 3 step to the left and 4 steps down
- wall 3 step to the left and 5 steps down

It seems like there's a vertical line of walls on the left. Maybe I can go around to the right.

Looking at the right side, there's a ""rule `win`"" 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, if I move right twice and up four times, I can reach it. But are there walls blocking that path?

I see a wall 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, but that's on the left. Maybe the right side is clearer.

Wait, there's a door 2 steps up. If I can open the door, I can go up. The key is 1 step to the left, so I need to move left once to get the key, then right to go back.

So, plan:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move right to go back towards the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Move up through the door towards the win.

But I need to make sure each step is possible without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to a more accessible location by rearranging the text blocks. But that might be more complex.

I think the simplest path is to get the key, open the door, and move up to the win. Let's try that.

First, move left to get the key. Then, move right to go back. Then, move up to go through the door. Then, continue up to the win.

But I need to check if the door is in the way. The door is 2 steps up, so after opening it, I can move up.

Wait, the door is at 2 steps up, and the win is 4 steps up. So, after opening the door, I need to move up two more steps.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move left once to pick up the key.
2. Move right once to go back to the starting position.
3. Move up once to reach the door.
4. Use the key to open the door (but in the game, opening the door is automatic once you have the key).
5. Move up again to go through the door.
6. Move up two more times to reach the win.

But I need to make sure each move is possible. Let me check the walls again.

After moving left, I'm at 1 step left. Then moving right brings me back. Then moving up, I need to ensure there's no wall blocking the way.

I think this is the best course of action. So, the first move is to go left to get the key.

There are walls around, which are immovable because of the ""wall"" rules. I also see a ""rule `stop`"" which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. I think that means if I move into that area, I might get stopped, so I should avoid it.

The key is 1 step to the right, and the door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, I might need the key to open the door. But wait, the door is at 2 steps right and 2 up, and the key is just 1 step right. Maybe I can pick up the key first and then go to the door.

But how do I move? I can go up, right, down, left, or idle. Let me plan the steps. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step to the right, I can move right once to get it. Then, I can move up twice and right twice to reach the door. Once I have the key, the door should open, allowing me to proceed further.

Wait, but I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does. Maybe it's just another object, but since I don't have a ball, I can ignore it for now.

So, the plan is: move right to get the key, then move up and right to the door, open it, and continue towards the win condition. Let me check if there are any walls blocking my path. The walls are at various positions, but I think the path to the key and door is clear.

I should also be careful not to step into the ""stop"" rule area. So, I'll make sure to move right first to get the key without going near the stop rule.

Alright, let's start by moving right to pick up the key.

I also notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" which is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That probably means that if I move into that area, I might get stopped. I should avoid that or find a way to change the rules to bypass it.

There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. Walls are usually immovable, so I need to make sure I don't hit them. Also, there are several walls around, so I have to navigate carefully.

The ""rule `key`"" is 2 steps to the right, and there's a key object 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to get the key first to proceed.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Balls can sometimes be used to push things or change the environment, but I'm not sure how yet.

My current position is where Baba is, which is probably near the center. I need to move towards the win condition. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right to pick up the key. That's 1 step to the right.
2. Then, move up to reach the door, which is 2 steps up from the key.
3. Once through the door, I can move towards the win condition, which is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the starting point.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable or to make the stop rule inactive. But that might be more complicated. For now, I'll try the straightforward approach.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win block is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a door 2 steps up, which might require a key to open. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Hmm, maybe I need to get the key to open the door to reach the win block.

I need to figure out how to move. The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. Since I'm trying to reach the win block, moving up or right seems logical. But I have to avoid walls and stop blocks.

Let me visualize the map. The Baba is at the origin, I think. The win block is up and to the right, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move around them. The key is to the left, but I need to get to the key first to open the door.

Wait, if I move left, I can get the key, then move up to the door and open it. But I have to make sure I don't hit any stop blocks. Let me plan the path: left to get the key, then up to the door, then right to the win block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are immovable because of the ""wall"" rules, so I can't go through them. The ""stop"" rule is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might block movement if I'm not careful.

I also see a ""key"" and a ""door."" The key is 2 steps to the right, and the door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I need the key to open the door to reach the win condition.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the key. Since the key is 2 steps to the right, I can move right twice. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. The walls are at various positions, but I think moving right twice should be clear.

Once I have the key, I can approach the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from my starting point. After picking up the key, moving up twice should get me to the door. With the key, I can open the door and proceed further.

After opening the door, my next target is the win condition. It's 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. I'll need to move right twice and then up four times, but I have to check if there are any walls or other obstacles in that path. The walls are mostly on the left side, so moving right should be clear.

Wait, I also see a ""ball"" rule. It's 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure if the ball affects anything here, but since I'm moving right, it might not interfere. I'll proceed carefully.

Another thing to consider is the ""baba"" rule at 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That's far from my current position, so I don't think it's relevant right now. The same goes for the ""is"" and ""you"" rules; they're too far down.

I should also be cautious of the ""stop"" rule. It's 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I move left too much, I might trigger it, but since I'm moving right, I should avoid that.

So, my plan is: move right twice to get the key, then up twice to reach the door, open it, and then move right twice and up four times to reach the win condition. Let me start by moving right to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a ""key"" and a ""door,"" which might be part of the path to the win. The key is 1 step to the left, and the door is 2 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which probably block movement. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so that's a bit far. The walls are scattered around, some with ""is"" rules, which might mean they have certain properties.

I need to figure out how to move Baba to reach the win. Since I can only move in four directions or idle, I should plan a path that avoids walls and uses any movable objects to my advantage. Maybe I can move some ""is"" rules to change properties of objects.

Wait, there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can change what the key does. But I'm not sure yet. The door is 2 steps up, so if I can get the key, I might be able to open it and reach the win.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Move towards the key. It's 1 step to the left, so I should go left.
2. Once I have the key, I can try to approach the door, which is 2 steps up.
3. After opening the door, I can move towards the win condition, which is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The walls are at various positions, so I need to navigate around them. Also, the ""stop"" rule is far up and to the left, so it might not interfere immediately.

I think the best first move is to go left to pick up the key. That way, I can proceed to the door and then towards the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and up, which might block my path. There's also a ""rule `stop`"" which could be an immovable object. I need to avoid that or find a way around it.

I see a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to get the key first to proceed.

Let me plan the steps. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the key. The key is 2 steps to the right. So, I should move right twice. But wait, I need to check if there are any walls or other objects in the way.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, but that's not in my path. Another wall is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up, again not directly in my way. The wall 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up might be closer, but I'm moving right, so I should be okay.

Wait, there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, and another wall 3 steps to the left. But since I'm moving right, I should avoid those. I think the path to the key is clear.

So, moving right twice should get me to the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. After that, I can proceed towards the win condition.

But I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's not relevant right now. I should focus on getting the key first.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `stop`"" 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. I need to make sure I don't move into that, as it might stop me or block my path. But since I'm moving right, it's on the opposite side, so it shouldn't be a problem.

I also see ""rule `baba`"" 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That's probably defining Baba's properties, but since I'm already controlling Baba, I might not need to interact with that unless I need to change rules.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can't change that unless I move the ""is"" or ""you"" blocks. But for now, I just need to reach the win condition.

So, to summarize, my plan is:

1. Move right twice to get the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed towards the win condition.

But I need to make sure each move is safe and doesn't lead me into a wall or the stop rule. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0).
- Moving right twice would take me to (2,0).
- The key is at (2,0), so I can pick it up.
- Then, moving up to reach the door at (1,2). Wait, no, the door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from where? Maybe I need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, perhaps the door is at (1,2), so after getting the key at (2,0), I need to move up twice and then right once to reach the door. But I need to check for walls in that path.

Looking back, there's a wall at (3,1) and (3,0), but I'm moving from (2,0) up to (2,2), then right to (3,2). Is there a wall there? The wall at (3,2) is mentioned, so I might hit a wall. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Perhaps I should move up first to avoid walls. Let me try:

1. Move up once to (0,1).
2. Then right twice to (2,1). Is there a wall there? The wall is at (3,1), so (2,1) is clear.
3. Then up once to (2,2), which is the door's position. But the door is at (1,2), so maybe I need to adjust.

Wait, the door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from where? If I'm at (0,0), moving right once and up twice would take me to (1,2), which is the door. But I need the key first.

So, perhaps:

1. Move right twice to (2,0) to get the key.
2. Then move up twice to (2,2).
3. Then left once to (1,2) to open the door.
4. Then proceed towards the win condition at (2,4).

But I need to check if the path from (2,2) to (1,2) is clear. There's a wall at (3,2), but (1,2) is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me try:

1. Move up once to (0,1).
2. Right twice to (2,1).
3. Up once to (2,2).
4. Left once to (1,2) to open the door.
5. Then up twice to (1,4), but the win is at (2,4). So I need to move right once to (2,4).

But I need to ensure there are no walls blocking this path. The walls are mostly on the left side, so moving right after opening the door should be okay.

Wait, there's a wall at (3,2), so moving right from (1,2) to (2,2) is fine, but (3,2) is a wall, so I can't go further right from (2,2). But the win is at (2,4), so I need to move up from (2,2) to (2,4). Is there a wall there? The wall is at (3,2), so (2,4) should be clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up from (2,2) to (2,3) and then to (2,4). I need to check if those positions are clear. The walls are at (3,3), (3,2), etc., so (2,3) and (2,4) should be clear.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right twice to (2,0) to get the key.
2. Move up twice to (2,2).
3. Move left once to (1,2) to open the door.
4. Move up twice to (1,4), but the win is at (2,4), so move right once to (2,4).

But wait, after opening the door at (1,2), I can move up to (1,3) and then right to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That might be safer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move up from (1,2) to (1,3), then right to (2,3), then up to (2,4). That way, I avoid any potential walls.

But I need to make sure each step is possible. Let me outline the exact moves:

1. From (0,0), move right to (1,0).
2. Right again to (2,0) to pick up the key.
3. Up to (2,1).
4. Up again to (2,2).
5. Left to (1,2) to open the door.
6. Up to (1,3).
7. Right to (2,3).
8. Up to (2,4) to win.

I think this path avoids walls and the stop rule. So, the first move should be right to start moving towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there are several walls and other rules. The walls are placed in various positions, some of which might block my path. I need to see if I can move any rules or objects to change the environment.

There's a ""rule `stop`"" which is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move this rule, maybe I can change what stops movement. But I'm not sure yet.

The ""rule `is`"" appears multiple times. One is at 4 steps up, another at 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up, and another at 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down. These might be used to create new rules by combining them with other objects.

There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move this, maybe I can change the properties of walls, making them passable or not.

The ""rule `key`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. There's also a key object 1 step to the left. Maybe I can use the key to open a door, but I need to see where the door is.

The door is 2 steps up. So, if I can get to the door, maybe I can open it with the key. But first, I need to get the key.

The ""rule `ball`"" is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure how that plays into this level.

The ""rule `baba`"" is 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe moving this can change Baba's properties.

The ""rule `you`"" is 7 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That's interesting because the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so maybe moving this can change who I am or what I can do.

Looking at the walls, they're placed in a way that might form a barrier. I need to see if I can break through them by changing the rules.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to create a new rule that allows me to move through them. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop movement, but if I can change that, maybe I can walk through them.

Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, but that might not be necessary here.

Let me plan my steps:

1. Move towards the key to pick it up. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once.

2. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is 2 steps up. So I need to move up twice after getting the key.

3. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. But I need to make sure the path is clear.

Wait, but the walls might be blocking the way. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" to say ""wall is nothing,"" then walls won't block me.

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to combine it with another word to change what stops movement.

Let me see the positions again. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move it to combine with ""wall,"" I can create ""wall is stop,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, I can move ""stop"" to combine with ""is"" to make ""is is stop,"" which would stop the creation of new rules, but that's probably not useful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up to combine with ""stop."" So, moving ""is"" to the position of ""stop"" would create ""stop is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe I need a different approach.

Another idea: if I can move the ""rule `you`"" to combine with ""win,"" making ""you is win,"" then when I reach the win object, I would win. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `baba`"" to change what Baba is. For example, making ""baba is win"" would mean that when I reach the win object, I win. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm controlling Baba. I need to get Baba to the win object. So, maybe I just need to navigate through the map, using the key to open the door, and then proceed to the win.

Let me try to move towards the key first. So, I'll move left once to pick up the key.

After that, I can move up twice to reach the door and open it with the key.

Once the door is open, I can move right once and up four times to reach the win object.

But I need to make sure that the path is clear. Are there any walls blocking me after the door?

Looking at the map, after the door, there are walls at various positions, but if I can move through them by changing the rules, that would help.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to open the door, and once I'm through, the path to win is clear.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left to pick up the key.

2. Move up twice to reach the door.

3. Use the key to open the door.

4. Move right once and up four times to reach the win.

But I need to make sure that the movements are possible without being blocked by walls.

Wait, the walls are placed at 4 steps to the left and various up positions. So, moving left might take me into a wall. I need to check if the path to the key is clear.

The key is 1 step to the left, so I need to see if there's a wall in that position. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps to the left, but I'm moving only 1 step left, so maybe that's clear.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged in a way that I can't move left without hitting a wall. I need to check the exact positions.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up, etc. So, moving 1 step left from my current position might not hit a wall.

I think it's safe to move left once to get the key.

So, the first action is to move left.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and up. There's also a door and a key, which might be relevant. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, and the key is 2 steps to the right. So, maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

But wait, the door is at 1 step right and 2 up, and the key is 2 steps right. So, if I move right twice, I can get the key, then go back to the door. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path.

Also, there are other rules like ""rule `stop`"" which might be preventing movement if I step on it. I need to avoid that or maybe use it to my advantage. The ""rule `ball`"" is 1 step left and 2 up, but I'm not sure how that affects things yet.

I should plan my movements carefully. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the key, then to the door, and then towards the win condition. Let me visualize the map:

- I'm at the starting point, which I'll consider as (0,0).
- The key is at (2,0), since it's 2 steps to the right.
- The door is at (1,2), which is 1 right and 2 up from me.
- The win condition is at (2,4), which is 2 right and 4 up.

So, the path would be: move right twice to get the key, then up twice to reach the door, then right once and up twice more to reach the win. But I need to check if there are walls blocking these paths.

Looking at the walls, there are walls at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), and (3,-2). So, the walls are along the x=3 line, which is to the right of me. That means I can move along x=0,1,2 without hitting walls, but x=3 is blocked.

So, moving right twice to x=2 is safe. Then, moving up to y=2, I can reach the door at (1,2). Wait, but the door is at (1,2), which is to the left of me at x=2. So, after getting the key at (2,0), I need to move up to (2,2), then left to (1,2) to open the door. Then, from there, I can move right to (2,2) and up to (2,4) to win.

But I need to make sure that the door is open. Since I have the key, I can open the door. So, the steps would be:

1. Move right twice to (2,0) to get the key.
2. Move up twice to (2,2).
3. Move left once to (1,2) to open the door.
4. Move right once to (2,2).
5. Move up twice to (2,4) to win.

I think that's the plan. Now, I need to execute these movements step by step, making sure I don't hit any walls or get stuck.

Wait, but the door is at (1,2). If I'm at (2,2), moving left to (1,2) should open the door, allowing me to pass. Then, moving right again to (2,2) and up to (2,4) should be possible.

I should also check if there are any other rules that might affect me. For example, the ""rule `stop`"" is at (5,4), which is far to the right and up, so I don't need to worry about it on my current path.

Another thing to consider is if moving the key or door affects the rules. Since I'm just moving to pick them up, I don't think I need to rearrange any rules unless the door requires the key to be in a specific place. But since I have the key, I should be able to open the door.

So, the first move is to the right to get closer to the key. Let's move right once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""stop,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""ball,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" and ""baba"" rules. I also notice that there are walls placed in various positions, which might block my path or the movement of other objects.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is one step to the right and four steps up from my current position. That gives me a target to aim for.

Next, I should look at the other rules. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change how other objects behave. The ""wall"" rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can manipulate this, I might be able to create or remove walls, which could help me navigate.

I also see a ""key"" object at 1 step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" at 1 step to the right. This suggests that the key might be involved in opening a door or changing a rule. The ""door"" is at 2 steps up, so maybe I need to get the key to open it.

The ""ball"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You usually move in a certain direction unless stopped, so if I can control the ball, it might help me reach the win condition or break through walls.

The ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left and 2 steps down. Since I'm Baba, moving this rule might change my properties or abilities. The ""is"" and ""you"" rules are also positioned, which could be used to create new rules or modify existing ones.

I need to plan my moves carefully. My current position is where ""baba is you"" is active. I should probably move towards the win condition, but walls might be in the way. Let me check the walls: there are walls at 4 steps left and 4 steps up, 4 steps left and 3 steps up, 4 steps left and 2 steps up, and so on. These walls might form a barrier that I need to break through or go around.

If I move right, I can get closer to the win condition, but I might hit a wall. Alternatively, moving up could help me bypass the walls. Let me see: moving up from my current position would take me towards the win condition, but I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps up. That's directly above me. If I move up, I might be able to interact with that rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"" or something else that helps me reach the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to prevent certain objects from moving or to create a path. For example, if I can place the ""stop"" rule on a wall, it might make that wall immovable, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Another idea: the ""key"" is at 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick up the key, which might allow me to open the door. The door is at 2 steps up, so after getting the key, I could move up to open it and reach the win condition.

But wait, the door is at 2 steps up, and the key is to the left. So I need to move left to get the key, then up to open the door. Let me visualize the map: I'm at the starting point, the key is to the left, and the door is up. So moving left, then up might be the way to go.

However, I need to make sure that the path is clear. Are there walls blocking my way? The walls are at various positions, but I think moving left and then up might avoid the walls. Let me check: moving left from my current position would take me to where the key is, and then moving up from there would take me towards the door and the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can't get through the door, maybe I can change the rules to make the door passable without the key. For example, if I can make ""door is open"" or something like that by rearranging the rules.

But for now, let's try the straightforward approach: get the key, open the door, and reach the win condition. So my first move should be to the left to pick up the key.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, moving onto an object usually picks it up, but I need to make sure that the key is movable. Since the key is an object, I can move it. So moving left would take me to the key's position, allowing me to pick it up.

Once I have the key, I can move up to the door. The door is at 2 steps up, so moving up twice from the key's position should get me there. Then, with the key, I can open the door and proceed to the win condition.

But I need to make sure that the door is indeed blocking the path. If the door is a wall, then having the key would allow me to pass through it. Alternatively, if the door is a different type of object, the key might change its properties.

Another consideration: the ""ball"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can manipulate the ball, it might help me reach the win condition or break through walls. For example, if I can make the ball push a wall or move in a certain direction, it could create a path.

But for now, focusing on the key and door seems more straightforward. Let me proceed with that plan.

So, my first move is to the left to pick up the key. Then, I'll move up to the door and use the key to open it, leading me to the win condition.

Wait, but in the list of objects, the ""key"" is at 1 step to the left, and the ""rule `key`"" is at 1 step to the right. That might mean that the key is an object, and the rule defines its properties. So moving the key might allow me to change its rule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is just an object that I need to collect to open the door. So moving left to pick it up is the right move.

Let me confirm: moving left from my current position would take me to the key's location. Then, moving up would take me towards the door and the win condition.

Yes, that seems like a solid plan. So my first action should be to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win block is somewhere in the upper right area. There's also a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, which might require a key to open. The key is 2 steps to the right, so I need to get that first.

But wait, there are walls and other blocks in the way. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I also notice a ""rule `stop`"" block, which probably means that block can't be moved. I need to be careful not to get stuck.

I think the strategy here is to move towards the key first. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win block. Let me plan my steps:

1. Move right to get closer to the key.
2. Once I have the key, move towards the door.
3. Open the door and proceed to the win block.

But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or get stuck. Let me visualize the map. The walls are on the left side, so moving right should be safe. The key is two steps to the right, so moving right twice should get me there.

Wait, but the key is also two steps to the right, so maybe I can just move right twice to pick it up. Then, I can move up towards the door and win block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls, but I'm not sure. I think moving right is the safest bet to get the key quickly.

So, I'll choose to move right to start collecting the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere in that area. I also notice there's a door 2 steps up, which might be a barrier I need to open. There's a key 1 step to the left, so maybe I need to pick that up to open the door.

Let me visualize the map. The Baba is at the starting point, and the win is to the right and up. There are walls around, so I need to navigate around them. The key is to the left, so I might need to move left to get it, then go back right to use it on the door.

Wait, but the door is 2 steps up. If I move up twice, I should reach it. But there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can break the wall by changing the rules. I see there are several rule blocks: ""stop,"" ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you."" 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make walls passable. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to a wall, it could change the wall's property. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is push"" to make walls movable.

But first, I need to get the key to open the door. The key is 1 step to the left. So, I should move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can go back right and up to the door. But wait, the door is 2 steps up, so I need to make sure there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule so that the door becomes passable without the key. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can walk through it. But I don't see a ""door"" rule block, so I might need to create it by moving the ""is"" and ""door"" blocks together.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think again. The key is to the left, so moving left would be a good first step. Once I have the key, I can use it on the door. But I need to make sure the door is accessible after that.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up, so after getting the key, I need to move up twice. But there might be walls blocking the way. Let me check the walls. There are walls at various positions, but I can try to navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule so that walls become passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule block, so I might need to create it by moving the ""is"" and ""pass"" blocks together. But I don't see a ""pass"" block, so that might not be possible.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I move ""stop"" next to a wall, it could make the wall stop me, but that's the opposite of what I want. Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" block.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. So, moving left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go back right and up to the door. But I need to make sure the path is clear.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up, so after getting the key, I need to move up twice. Let me check if there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, but I think I can navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But I need to check if that's possible.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That's far away. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the door passable. For example, if I can make ""door is stop,"" but that would stop me, which is not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I can move it next to the door, it might unlock it. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to move left to get the key first. So, the action would be ""left."" Once I have the key, I can figure out the next steps.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and up. There's also a door and a key. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, and the key is 2 steps to the right. So, maybe I need the key to open the door.

But wait, the door is at 1 step right and 2 up, and the key is 2 steps right. So, I might need to move right to get the key, then go back to the door. But I also have to consider the walls. There are walls blocking some paths, so I need to find a way around them.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" which is 1 step left and 2 up. I'm not sure what that does yet. Maybe it's a distraction or part of another rule I can create.

The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps left and 4 up. I don't know if that's relevant yet. Maybe it's an obstacle or a rule I can manipulate.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I could push walls out of the way.

But right now, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" I need to see if I can create new rules by moving the ""is"" and other rule blocks. For instance, if I can move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can make walls pushable.

Looking at the positions, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step right and 4 up, and another ""rule `is`"" is 6 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I can move one of these to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 4 up is near the ""rule `win`"" which is 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" block to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or make walls movable.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the key first, which is 2 steps right. But there might be walls in the way. If I can move the ""is"" block to make walls passable, that would help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a ""baba is key"" rule, which would let me pick up the key without needing to move to it. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the key is 2 steps right, and the door is 1 step right and 2 up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door. But to get the key, I might need to move right, but there are walls blocking me.

Let me check the walls. The walls are at 3 steps left and 4 up, 3 left and 3 up, 3 left and 2 up, etc. So, moving right might be blocked by walls. Maybe I need to go up first to bypass them.

If I move up, I can go towards the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" block to create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" block to the ""wall"" to make walls passable. The ""rule `wall`"" is 7 steps left and 3 up. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can make walls pushable.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule on the map. Hmm. Maybe I need to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to another word.

Wait, there's a ""rule `ball`"" at 1 step left and 2 up. Maybe I can use that. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push the ball to move walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to get the key first.

I need to move right twice to get the key. But are there walls blocking me? The walls are at 3 left and various up positions. So, if I'm at the starting position, moving right might be possible.

Wait, the starting position is where Baba is, which is probably near the bottom. The walls are more to the left and up. So, moving right might be clear.

Let me try moving right twice to get the key. Then, I can go back to the door and open it to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure there are no walls in the way. If there are, I might need to change the rules first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get to the ""is"" block and create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get the key, then use it to open the door and reach the win.

So, I'll choose to move right.

My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The ""WIN"" rule is located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. That seems like my target. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I notice there are multiple walls and rule blocks. The walls are placed in a way that might block my path, but since I'm Baba, I can move through them unless they have a ""STOP"" rule. Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be a wall that stops me, but I'm not sure yet.

I also see a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock a door. The door is 2 steps up, so if I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and reach the win condition.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left. But I need to check if there are any walls or rules blocking that path. The walls are 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might be above me, so moving left might be clear.

Wait, but I also see a ""ball"" rule 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's just another object I can ignore for now. My main focus is getting the key and opening the door.

So, my first move should be to the left to pick up the key. That way, I can then move up to the door and proceed to the win condition. Let me try moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key. The key is 2 steps to the right, so I should go there first.

But wait, there are walls around. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I need to see if I can move through them or if I can change the rules to make them passable. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around, but walls are usually immovable unless I change their properties.

I also notice there are several ""rule `is`"" blocks and other rule pieces. Maybe I can rearrange these to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""rule `stop`"" block next to a wall, I could make the wall stop being a wall, or something like that. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba able to pass through walls by changing the rules.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to get the key to open the door. The key is 2 steps to the right, but I have to move around the walls. Let me see the layout:

- Starting position: I'm at the origin, I think.
- The key is 2 steps right, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go up first to avoid them.
- There's a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step left and 2 steps up. Not sure if that's useful yet.
- The door is 1 step right and 2 steps up, so after getting the key, I can go there.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `key`"" block to change what the key does. The ""rule `key`"" is 2 steps to the right. If I can move it next to something else, maybe I can make the key do something else, like become a passable object.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" blocks to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is passable,"" then I can walk through walls.

Let me try to move the ""rule `is`"" block that's 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move it next to a wall, I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea: since the win condition is 2 steps right and 4 steps up, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block to a different location, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block to a wall to make it stop being a wall. The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can move it next to a wall, I can make that wall stop, which might make it passable.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `you`"" block to change what ""you"" is. The ""rule `you`"" is 6 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move it next to something else, maybe I can become something else, like a key or a passable object.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. Identify the key's position: 2 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the way. I need to find a path or change the rules to get past them.

2. The door is 1 step right and 2 steps up. Once I have the key, I can open it, but I need to reach it.

3. The win condition is 2 steps right and 4 steps up. That's the target.

Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me see:

- Move up to get past the walls. Then, move right to get the key.

But I need to check if the walls are in the way when moving up. The walls are at various positions, but if I move up 4 steps, I might be able to go around.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is passable,"" then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to a wall.

Looking at the ""rule `is`"" blocks, the one at 1 step right and 4 steps up is close to the win condition. Maybe I can move that ""is"" block down to a wall.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block to a wall to make it stop being a wall.

Let me try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block. It's 5 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can move it next to a wall, I can make that wall stop, which might make it passable.

But moving it might require several steps. Let me see:

- Move left 5 times and up 4 times to get to the ""rule `stop`"" block.

But that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it's the best approach.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `you`"" block to change what I am. If I can make ""you is key,"" then I can become the key and open the door without picking it up.

The ""rule `you`"" is 6 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move it next to the ""key"" block, I can create ""you is key.""

But that would require moving the ""you"" rule to the key's position, which is 2 steps right. That might be a long move.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Let me try to move the ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step right and 4 steps up. If I can move it down to a wall, I can create ""wall is passable.""

So, the plan is:

1. Move right 1 step and up 4 steps to get the ""rule `is`"" block.

2. Move down to a wall, say, the wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up.

But wait, moving the ""is"" block requires that it's not fixed. I think in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks as long as they're not part of an active rule.

Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" the ""is"" blocks not part of that rule can be moved.

So, I can move the ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step right and 4 steps up down to a wall.

Let me try that.

After moving the ""is"" block down to a wall, the new rule becomes ""wall is passable,"" which allows me to walk through walls.

Once that's done, I can move through the walls to reach the key and the door.

So, the first action is to move right to get to the ""is"" block.

But wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me see:

- Starting position: Let's assume it's at (0,0).

- The ""rule `is`"" block is at (1,4).

So, I need to move right once and up four times to get there.

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I can move up first to get closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up and then right.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. I need to make sure I don't hit any walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `key`"" block to make the key do something else.

The ""rule `key`"" is 2 steps to the right. If I can move it next to something else, maybe I can make the key into a passable object.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The key is 2 steps to the right. There's a wall blocking the way. If I can make walls passable, I can reach the key.

So, the best approach is to create a rule that makes walls passable.

To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to a wall.

The ""rule `is`"" block at (1,4) is a good candidate. If I can move it down to a wall, I can create ""wall is passable.""

So, the steps are:

1. Move right to (1,0).

2. Move up to (1,4) to pick up the ""is"" block.

3. Move down to (1,3), which is a wall. Now, the rule becomes ""wall is passable.""

Once that's done, I can walk through walls.

Then, I can move right 2 steps to get the key, even if there are walls in the way.

After getting the key, I can go to the door, which is 1 step right and 2 steps up.

Once the door is open, I can proceed to the win condition.

So, the first action is to move right to start moving towards the ""is"" block.

But wait, moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) is the first step.

So, the action is ""right.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls around, which are immovable because of the ""wall"" rules. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. There's also a door 2 steps up, which might require a key to open. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the key to open the door.

But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps left and 4 up, which might be an obstacle. The walls are spread out, creating a sort of maze. The door is 2 steps up, so if I move up twice, I should reach it. But before that, I need the key.

The key is 1 step to the left. So, if I move left once, I can pick up the key. Then, I can move up to the door. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall or an immovable object. Let me check the walls: there's a wall 4 steps left and 4 up, which is probably above me. Another wall is 4 steps left and 3 up, so moving left once shouldn't hit a wall immediately.

So, the plan is: move left to get the key, then move up to the door, use the key to open it, and then proceed towards the win condition. But wait, do I need to change any rules? The current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move as Baba. There's a ""rule `key`"" which might define the key's properties. If I can move the key, I can pick it up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change its properties, but that might complicate things. For now, let's stick to the straightforward approach: get the key, open the door, and reach the win.

So, the first step is to move left to pick up the key. That should be the best course of action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The ""WIN"" rule is located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems like my target. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door or something. There's a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So perhaps I need to get the key first to open the door and reach the win condition.

Let me visualize the map. The Baba is at the starting point, and the win is to the right and up. There are walls around, so I need to navigate carefully. The key is to the right, so I should move right to get it. Once I have the key, I can go up to the door and open it.

Wait, but how do I move? The possible actions are idle, up, right, down, left. I need to choose the right sequence of moves. Since the key is to the right, I should move right first. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, but I'm starting from the center, so moving right shouldn't be blocked immediately. I can try moving right to pick up the key.

After getting the key, I can move up towards the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, so from the key's position, moving up twice should get me there. Once I open the door, I can proceed further up to reach the win condition.

I should also be cautious of any other rules or objects that might affect my movement. For example, if there's a ""stop"" rule nearby, it might prevent me from moving further. But in this case, the ""stop"" rule is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is in the opposite direction of where I'm going, so it shouldn't interfere.

So, the plan is: move right to get the key, then move up to the door, open it, and continue up to the win. The first step is to move right to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere in that area. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps up, which might be a barrier I need to open. The ""key"" is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That suggests that the key might be needed to open the door.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which probably block movement. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so that's a significant barrier. There are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around, which could be used to create new rules if I move them correctly.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to figure out how to get to the win. The door is in the way, so I probably need the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is 2 steps up.

But wait, there are walls and ""stop"" rules that might block my path. I need to make sure I can move freely. The ""rule `wall`"" is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which might be a wall that's blocking the way. If I can move that rule, I might be able to create a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by rearranging the ""is"" and other rules. For example, if I can move a ""rule `is`"" next to another object, I can define a new property. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me plan my steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key. That should allow me to open the door.
2. Once I have the key, move up to the door and open it.
3. After opening the door, move towards the win condition, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up.

I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path after opening the door. If there are, I might need to move some rules to remove the walls or make them passable.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is quite far to the left and up. Maybe it's not directly in my path. I should focus on getting the key first.

So, my first move should be to the left to get the key. That way, I can proceed to open the door and reach the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The ""WIN"" rule is located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems like my target. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps the path to the win involves getting the key, opening the door, and then proceeding to the win.

But wait, the walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I need to see if I can move any rules to change the environment. For example, if I can move a ""wall"" rule, I might be able to create a path or remove an obstacle.

Let me visualize the map. The Baba is at the starting point, and the win is to the right and up. There are walls around, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to create a new path.

I also see a ""stop"" rule. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent certain objects from moving or blocking me. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Another thing is the ""ball"" rule. I'm not sure what effect that has, but maybe it's part of the solution. Perhaps if I can make the ball do something, it can help me reach the win.

I think the key steps are:
1. Move towards the key to pick it up.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed through the door to reach the win.

But I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let me check the positions again. The key is 2 steps to the right, so I can move right twice to get it. Then, the door is 1 step to the right and 2 up, so after getting the key, I can move up twice and right once to open the door.

Wait, but there are walls in the way. Are there any walls blocking my path to the key? The walls are at various positions, but I think the direct path to the key is clear. Let me count the steps. Starting from Baba's position, moving right twice should get me to the key without hitting any walls.

Once I have the key, I can move up twice and right once to reach the door. Then, with the key, the door should open, allowing me to proceed further up to the win.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange some rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. But for now, the straightforward approach seems to be getting the key, opening the door, and then reaching the win.

I should also consider if there are any other rules that can be manipulated. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately, but that might not be possible here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba.

Another thought: the ""stop"" rule is 5 steps to the left and 4 up. Maybe if I can move that, I can stop some walls from blocking me. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. It might complicate things more.

I think the best course of action is to move right twice to get the key, then use it to open the door, and proceed to the win. So, my next move should be to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

First, I should note the positions of other objects. There's a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps left and 4 up, which might be an obstacle. Walls are scattered around, especially at 4 steps left and various up positions, which could block my path. There's also a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right, which might be useful for opening a door. The door is 2 steps up, so maybe I need the key to proceed.

I see a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps left and 2 up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push or break things. The ""rule `baba`"" is 9 steps left and 2 down, which might be another Baba or a rule that can be manipulated. The ""rule `you`"" is 7 steps left and 2 down, which could be another way to change the rules.

Since I'm currently at the starting position, I need to plan my moves. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can pick it up by moving left. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is 2 steps up. But I need to make sure the path is clear.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps left and 4 up, which is directly above the win condition. That might block my path unless I can move it. But walls are usually immovable unless I change the rules. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to make walls pushable or something.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is 8 steps left and 3 up. If I can move that rule, I might be able to change how walls behave. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can get the ball to the right spot, it might help me reach the win condition. The ball is 2 steps left and 2 up, so I can move towards it after picking up the key.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Move left to pick up the key. That will allow me to open the door.
2. Once I have the key, move up towards the door. But I need to check if the path is clear. There's a wall 4 steps left and 2 up, which might be in the way.
3. If the wall is blocking the path, I might need to change the rules to make it movable. Alternatively, I can use the ball to break it.
4. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition, which is 1 step right and 4 up.

Wait, but moving right from my current position might take me away from the key. Maybe I should first go up to reach the door, then right to the win. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: let's assume it's the origin (0,0).
- Key is at (-1, 0).
- Door is at (0, 2).
- Win is at (1, 4).
- Walls are at (-4,4), (-4,3), (-4,2), (-4,1), (-4,0), (-4,-1), (-4,-2), etc.

So, to get to the door, I need to move up twice. But there's a wall at (-4,2), which is 4 steps left and 2 up. That's far to the left, so maybe it's not directly in my path. My path to the door is more towards the center, so perhaps the walls aren't blocking me immediately.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged in a way that I need to go around. But since I'm starting at (0,0), moving left to get the key at (-1,0), then up to (0,2) for the door, then right to (1,4) for the win.

Wait, but after picking up the key at (-1,0), moving right back to (0,0) would be necessary before moving up. Alternatively, maybe I can move up from (-1,0) to (-1,1), but I need to check if there are walls there.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (-4,1), which is far left, so maybe the path from (-1,0) to (0,2) is clear. Let me try that.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left to (-1,0) to pick up the key.
2. Move up twice to (0,2) to open the door.
3. Move right once to (1,2), then up twice more to (1,4) to reach the win.

But I need to make sure that the door is passable after using the key. Also, I should check if there are any other rules that might affect this. For example, if ""door is stop,"" then I can't pass through it. But the active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so unless there's another rule, the door should be passable once opened.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make the door openable. But since I have the key, I can probably open it.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, the key might not automatically open the door unless there's a rule like ""key is open"" or something. Let me check the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you."" There's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right, which is at (1,0). So, if I move the key rule next to the key object, I can create a new rule like ""key is open,"" which would allow me to open the door.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Move left to (-1,0) to pick up the key.
2. Move right to (0,0) to place the key next to the ""rule `key`"" at (1,0). Wait, no, the ""rule `key`"" is at (1,0), so if I move the key to (1,0), I can form ""key is key,"" which doesn't help. Maybe I need to move the ""rule `key`"" to make a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" next to the key to make ""key is something."" For example, moving the ""rule `is`"" at (4,4) down to the key's position.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at (4,4), which is far up. That might not be easy to reach. Alternatively, there's a ""rule `is`"" at (7,3), which is 7 steps left and 3 up. That's also far.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to move towards the key first.

So, first action: move left to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. The ""stop"" rule is positioned 5 steps left and 4 up, which might be a barrier. There's a ""win"" rule 2 steps right and 4 up, so that's probably the target I need to reach.

I also notice a ""key"" object 2 steps right, which might be needed to open a door. The door is 1 step right and 2 up. So maybe I need to get the key first to open the door and reach the win condition.

But wait, the ""baba"" rule is 8 steps left and 2 down, and the ""you"" rule is 6 steps left and 2 down. Since ""baba is you,"" moving Baba will move me. I need to see how I can navigate around the walls.

The walls are placed in a way that might block my path. I see walls at various positions, so I need to find a path that avoids them or uses the rules to change their properties.

I think the key is to collect the key first. To get to the key, I need to move right. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the positions:

- The key is 2 steps right.
- There's a wall 3 steps left and 4 up, but I'm starting from the origin, so moving right might be possible.

Wait, the ""rule `key`"" is 2 steps right, so maybe I can move towards it. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps left and 4 up, but that's above me. The walls at 3 steps left and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, and so on might form a vertical barrier. But if I move right, I might be able to go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can break a rule to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But I need to see if I can rearrange the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 5 steps left and 4 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can make that wall immovable. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would become controllable, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Let me think about the door. The door is 1 step right and 2 up. To open it, I probably need the key. So I need to get the key first.

To get the key, I need to move right. But are there walls blocking that path? The walls are at 3 steps left, which is to my left, so moving right might be clear.

Wait, the key is 2 steps right, so I can move right twice to reach it. But I need to check if there are walls in that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps left and 4 up, but that's above me. The walls at 3 steps left and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, and so on are to my left, so moving right should be clear.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right twice to reach the key.
2. Once I have the key, move up to the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed to the win condition.

But wait, I need to make sure that moving right is possible. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: origin (0,0)
- Key is at (2,0)
- Door is at (1,2)
- Win is at (2,4)

So, moving right twice from (0,0) gets me to (2,0), which is the key. Then, moving up from there to (2,2) would be blocked by the door, but with the key, I can open it and proceed to (2,4) to win.

But I need to check if there are walls blocking the path from (2,0) to (2,2). The walls are at 3 steps left, which is (-3, y), so they shouldn't interfere with my path on the right side.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps left, which is to the left of the origin, so moving right should be clear. Therefore, moving right twice to get the key is feasible.

So, the first step is to move right twice. But since each action is a single step, I need to choose ""right"" as my action to start moving towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right once to get closer, but I need to make sure each step is clear.

Wait, the key is 2 steps right, so I need to move right twice. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I'll choose ""right"" to start moving towards the key.

But let me double-check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps left, which is (-3, y), so moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) and then to (2,0) should be clear.

Yes, so moving right is the way to go.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere in that area. I also notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That might be important because keys often unlock doors.

There's a door 2 steps up, which is probably blocking the path to the win condition. To open the door, I might need the key. So, my plan is to get the key, use it on the door, and then proceed to the win.

First, I need to move towards the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left. But I also see walls around, so I need to make sure I don't hit any. Let me check the walls' positions. There are walls at various positions, but the key is accessible from my current position.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, and I'm currently at the starting point. So, moving left once should get me the key. But I also see a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to move the key rule to change something, but for now, getting the key seems more straightforward.

So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can use it on the door, which is 2 steps up. But before that, I need to make sure the door is in a position I can reach after getting the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key rule to change the key's properties, but that might complicate things. Since the key is already on the map, I can just pick it up and use it.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, sometimes you need to manipulate the rules to change what objects do. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" then I can control the key. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba.

So, moving left to get the key is the first step. Once I have the key, I can move up to the door and use it to open it. Then, I can proceed to the win condition.

But I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be a rule that stops me, so I need to be careful not to trigger it. Maybe I can move the stop rule somewhere else or break it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop,"" that would prevent me from moving, which isn't helpful. So, I need to avoid that.

Another thought: the ""rule `ball`"" is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure. Since I have a key, focusing on that might be better.

So, to summarize, my steps are:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Move up to the win condition.

But wait, in the current setup, the door is 2 steps up, and the key is 1 step to the left. So, after moving left to get the key, I need to move right to get back to the door's position, then up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key rule to change the key's behavior, but that might not be necessary. Let's stick to the straightforward approach.

So, the first action is to move left to get the key. That should be the next step.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere in that area. There's also a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, which might be a barrier I need to open. To open the door, I probably need a key. Checking the objects, there's a ""key"" 1 step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That suggests that the key is nearby and can be moved or used.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which are likely immovable. The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so that's a barrier I can't pass through. The walls are placed in various positions, creating a sort of maze.

To get to the win condition, I need to navigate around the walls. Since the door is in the way, I should first get the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can move right to the door and open it.

But wait, I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to break through walls or something, but since I have a key, maybe I don't need it right now.

Let me plan my steps. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move left to get the key. So, I'll move left once. Then, with the key, I can move right towards the door. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get a better view, but the walls might block me. Let me check the walls. There are walls 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is where the ""rule `stop`"" is. So, moving up from there might not be possible.

I think the best course of action is to move left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can move right to the door and open it, then proceed to the win condition. So, my first move should be to the left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

First, I should note the positions of other objects. There are walls, a door, a key, and some other rules. The walls are at various positions, so I need to avoid them or see if I can move them. The door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and there's a key 1 step to the right. That suggests I might need the key to open the door.

Wait, but the door is at 2 right and 2 up, and the key is 1 right. So maybe I can pick up the key first. But how? The key is an object, so I can move it if it's not a ""STOP"" or similar. The rule for the key is ""rule `key` 3 steps to the right,"" which I think means the key is movable.

So, my plan is to move towards the key. Since I'm Baba, I can move left, right, up, or down. Let me see the path. The key is 1 step to the right. So, I can move right once to get the key. But wait, are there any walls blocking me? Let me check the walls.

The walls are at 2 left and 4 up, 2 left and 3 up, 2 left and 2 up, 2 left and 1 up, 2 left, 2 left and 1 down, and 2 left and 2 down. So, moving right from my starting position (assuming I'm at the origin), I can go right without hitting a wall immediately. So, moving right once should get me to the key.

After picking up the key, I can then move towards the door. The door is 2 right and 2 up, so from the key's position (1 right), I need to move right once more and up twice. But I need to make sure the door isn't blocked. The door's rule is ""rule `door` 2 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" so it's a door object, which I can open with the key.

Once I have the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition. Alternatively, maybe the door is a shortcut or allows me to bypass some walls.

But wait, there's also a ""rule `stop`"" at 4 left and 4 up. I need to make sure I don't move into a stop block, as that would prevent me from moving further. But since I'm moving right, I might not be affected by that.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `ball`"" at 2 up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's a distraction or part of another rule I can manipulate. However, since my immediate goal is to get the key and open the door, I'll focus on that first.

So, the steps I think I should take are:
1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Move through the door towards the win condition.

But wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes you can change the rules by moving text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules, I might be able to create a new rule that helps me win faster or change the win condition.

Looking at the rules, there are multiple ""is"" rules at different positions. Maybe I can move an ""is"" block next to another object to create a new rule. For instance, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could create ""win is something,"" but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would be the win condition, and I could win immediately. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to Baba. However, moving rules requires moving the text blocks, which might be possible if they're not stopped.

But right now, my immediate concern is getting the key and opening the door. So, I'll proceed with moving right to get the key.

Wait, but the key is at 1 step to the right, and the door is at 2 right and 2 up. So, after getting the key, I need to move up twice and right once more. Let me check if there are walls in that path. The walls are at 2 left and various up positions, so moving right and up should be clear.

Another consideration: after opening the door, what's on the other side? It might lead me closer to the win condition or reveal another rule I can use. But without seeing the full map, I have to assume it's a necessary step.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the win condition easier. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then opening the door would win the level. But that requires moving the ""win"" rule next to the door, which might be possible after I get the key.

But for now, I think the most straightforward path is to get the key, open the door, and proceed towards the win condition. So, my first move should be to the right to pick up the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. But there are walls and other rules in the way, so I need to figure out how to get there.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can use the key to open a door or change a rule. There's a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, so perhaps I need to get the key first to open that door.

Let me plan my path. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is where Baba is. I need to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking me. The map shows walls at various positions, but I think moving left from my current spot is possible.

After getting the key, I can move right to the door. Once I open the door, maybe I can proceed towards the win condition. Alternatively, maybe moving the key or other rules around can change the environment to make the path clearer.

I should also consider if there are any other rules I can manipulate. For example, if I can move a ""wall"" rule, I might be able to create a path or remove an obstacle. But I need to be careful not to move any ""stop"" rules, as they might be immovable.

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" I can pick up and move other objects if they're not defined as ""STOP."" So, maybe I can move some walls or rules to create a new path or change the win condition.

Wait, there's a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's a distraction or part of the solution. I'll keep that in mind.

So, to summarize, my steps should be:
1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door to the right.
3. Proceed towards the win condition, possibly manipulating other rules along the way.

I think moving left is the first logical step to get the key, which will likely help me progress towards the win.

My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The ""WIN"" rule is located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems like my target. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the right and a ""rule `key`"" 3 steps to the right. Maybe I can use the key to open a door or change a rule. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Perhaps the door is blocking my path, and I need the key to open it.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the ""WIN"" rule. But I have walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to navigate around them. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls on the left.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I move left too much, I might hit a stop block, which would prevent me from moving further. I should avoid that.

I think the best approach is to move right first to get the key, then use it to open the door. Once the door is open, I can proceed towards the ""WIN"" rule. Let me check the positions again.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to create space. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me try moving right to get the key first.

So, my first move should be to the right to pick up the key. That way, I can use it later to open the door and reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. The ""stop"" rule is positioned 5 steps left and 4 steps up. There's a wall nearby, which might block my movement. The ""is"" rule is 1 step right and 4 steps up, and the ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 steps up. That seems important because if I can reach the ""win"" rule, I might be able to change the win condition or use it to my advantage.

I also notice a ""wall"" rule 7 steps left and 3 steps up, and another ""is"" rule 6 steps left and 3 steps up. There are multiple walls around, which could be blocking my path or the path to the win condition. The ""ball"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps up, and there's a door 1 step right and 2 steps up. Doors usually require keys to open, so I should look for a key.

The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""key"" rule 2 steps to the right. That might mean that the key can be used to open the door, which could lead to the win condition. There's also a ""baba"" rule 8 steps left and 2 steps down, an ""is"" rule 7 steps left and 2 steps down, and a ""you"" rule 6 steps left and 2 steps down. These might be part of a rule chain that I can manipulate.

Walls are scattered around, but I need to see if I can move any of them to create a path. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, which is me. I need to figure out how to get to the win condition or change the rules to make the win condition easier.

Let me visualize the map. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 steps up. That's in the upper right area. The door is 1 step right and 2 steps up, which is closer. The key is 1 step left, so I can pick it up. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps left and various up positions. I need to see if I can move any walls or rules to clear a path. Since I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar, I need to check if any walls are movable.

Looking at the ""wall"" rule, it's 7 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule, I might be able to change what counts as a wall. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to say ""wall is push,"" then walls could be pushed. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I can position it correctly, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the win condition.

Another idea is to manipulate the ""is"" rules. If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then Baba would be the win condition, and I could win by being myself. But I need to see if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. First, I should move towards the key to open the door. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once to pick it up. Then, I can move right to the door and use the key to open it. Once the door is open, I can proceed further up towards the win condition.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at 3 steps left and various up positions. I need to see if I can move any walls or rules to clear the path. If I can't move the walls, I might need to find another way around.

Alternatively, I could try to change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls out of the way. But I need to see if I can move the ""wall"" rule to do that.

Looking at the ""wall"" rule, it's 7 steps left and 3 steps up. I can move it by moving the ""is"" or ""wall"" parts. If I move the ""is"" part, I can change what the wall is. For example, moving the ""is"" rule to ""wall is push"" would make walls pushable.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe it's simpler to just move towards the key and door first. Let me try that.

So, my plan is:
1. Move left once to pick up the key.
2. Move right to the door and use the key to open it.
3. Proceed up towards the win condition.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path after opening the door. If there are, I might need to adjust my plan.

Alternatively, if I can't open the door, I might need to change the rules to make the door passable without a key. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through without needing the key.

But I think the key is the intended way to proceed. So, I'll try moving left to pick up the key first.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once. Then, I can move right to the door, which is 1 step right and 2 steps up. So, after picking up the key, I need to move up twice and right once to reach the door.

But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are at 3 steps left and various up positions, so I need to see if moving up twice and right once would take me through any walls.

If the path is clear, I can proceed. If not, I might need to find another way or change the rules.

Another consideration is the ""ball"" rule, which is 1 step left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure how that affects the game, but maybe it's a distraction or part of a different rule chain.

In any case, my immediate goal is to pick up the key and open the door to reach the win condition. So, I'll start by moving left to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first thought is to identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is three steps to the right and four steps up from my starting position.

Next, I need to figure out how to get there. The path might be blocked by walls, so I should check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up, but I'm more concerned about the path to the right since the win is to the right.

I also notice a ""key"" object one step to the right. That might be useful for opening a door. There's a ""door"" two steps to the right and two steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win.

But wait, I also see a ""rule `stop`"" block. If I can manipulate the rules, maybe I can change what ""stop"" does or remove it to make movement easier. However, I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Move towards the key to pick it up. Since the key is one step to the right, I can move right once to get it.
2. Once I have the key, I can move towards the door, which is two steps to the right and two steps up. But I need to make sure the path is clear.
3. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

But I should also consider if there are any other rules that might affect my movement. For example, if ""wall"" is defined as something that stops me, I need to make sure I can move through walls or avoid them. However, since I'm just starting, I might not have the ability to change rules yet.

Wait, I see a ""rule `wall`"" block. If I can move that, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. But that might be more complicated than necessary. For now, I'll focus on getting the key and opening the door.

So, my immediate action should be to move right to pick up the key. That way, I can progress towards the door and eventually the win.

I think moving right is the best first step. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first thought is to identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is two steps to the right and four steps up from my starting position.

Next, I need to figure out how to get there. The path might be blocked by walls, so I should check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up, but I'm not sure exactly how they block the path yet.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object one step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" two steps to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something, like a door. There's a door one step to the right and two steps up, so perhaps that's the way to go.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can also manipulate the rules by moving the ""rule"" blocks. For example, if I can move the ""WIN"" rule closer or change it, that might help. But right now, the ""WIN"" is two steps to the right and four up, which seems a bit far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the win condition easier.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to make the key behave differently, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. The key is one step to the left, so I can pick it up by moving left. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is one step to the right and two up. That might be the path to the win condition.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move left to pick up the key. So, I'll go left once. Then, I can move right towards the door. But wait, the door is two steps up and one to the right. So after picking up the key, I should move up twice and right once to reach the door. Once through the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

But I should also consider if there are any walls blocking my path. The walls are positioned at various steps, but I'm not sure exactly how they're arranged. Maybe I can move some walls by manipulating the rules. For example, if I can make a wall into a different object, I can move it out of the way.

Another idea is to change the ""WIN"" rule. If I can move the ""WIN"" rule closer, that would make it easier to reach. But I need to see if there are any other rules I can use to do that. For example, if I can make ""WIN"" into something else, or create a new rule that defines a different win condition.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is six steps to the left and four up. Maybe that's an immovable object, so I should avoid it. The ""rule `ball`"" is two steps to the left and two up. I'm not sure what the ball does, but maybe it's a distraction.

I think the most straightforward approach is to pick up the key, open the door, and then proceed to the win condition. So, my first move should be to the left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first thought is to identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is three steps to the right and four steps up from my starting position.

Next, I need to figure out how to get there. The path might be blocked by walls, so I should check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up, but I'm not sure exactly how they're arranged. I might need to move around them or break through them if possible.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object one step to the right. That could be useful if there's a locked door. The door is two steps to the right and two steps up. So, if I pick up the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

Another important rule is ""rule `stop` 4 step to the left and 4 step up."" This probably means that if I move four steps left and four steps up, I'll hit a stop block, which could prevent me from moving further in that direction. I need to be cautious about that.

I also see ""rule `ball` 2 step up."" That might mean there's a ball object two steps up from my position. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be pushed or used to trigger other actions, so that could be useful.

The ""rule `key` 3 steps to the right"" indicates that the key is three steps to the right. Wait, but earlier it says ""key 1 step to the right."" That might be a typo or confusion in the description. I need to clarify that. If the key is one step to the right, I can easily pick it up by moving right once.

Once I have the key, I can approach the door two steps to the right and two steps up. Using the key on the door should open it, allowing me to proceed further towards the win condition.

I also notice several ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" blocks, which might be part of the rule definitions. These could be used to change the rules if needed, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I might not need to alter that unless I encounter a problem.

The walls are positioned in a way that might create a barrier, but I can navigate around them by moving up or down as needed. I should also be aware of the ""rule `stop`"" block to avoid getting stuck.

So, my plan is to first move right to pick up the key. Then, move towards the door, use the key to open it, and proceed towards the win condition. I'll need to navigate around any walls and be cautious of the stop block.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Move towards the door, which is two steps to the right and two steps up.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed towards the win condition, which is three steps to the right and four steps up.

I should also check if there are any other rules or objects that might affect my path. For example, if there's a ""WIN"" rule that's not the usual ""WIN"" object, I might need to adjust my goal accordingly. But based on the current information, I think the key and door are the main obstacles to overcome.

Another consideration is whether moving the key or other rule blocks can change the rules. For instance, if I move the ""WIN"" rule, it might change the win condition. But since I'm just trying to reach the current win condition, I might not need to alter the rules unless I'm blocked.

I should also be cautious of the ""stop"" rule. If I move four steps left and four steps up, I'll hit a stop block, which could prevent me from moving further in that direction. I need to make sure I don't accidentally trigger that while navigating.

In summary, my strategy is to collect the key, open the door, and move towards the win condition while avoiding walls and the stop block. I'll proceed step by step, checking each move to ensure I'm on the right path.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. But there are walls in the way. Let me visualize the map.

There's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is directly above me. Another wall is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up, so that's one step down from the first wall. There's also a wall 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up, and another at 3 steps left and 1 step up. So, there's a vertical line of walls on the left side, blocking my path upwards.

But wait, I also see a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. Maybe I can get the key to unlock a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and maybe reach the win condition.

How do I get the key? The key is 1 step to the right. So, I can move right once to pick it up. But before that, I need to make sure I can move right without any obstacles. Let me check the walls. The wall is 3 steps to the left, so moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the origin) should be clear.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is 1 step right and 2 up. After opening the door, I can proceed further up. But there's a wall 3 steps left and 1 step up, so I need to navigate around that.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. I see several ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `wall`"" blocks. If I can move these, I might change the rules to make walls passable or remove them. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing,"" that could help me move through or remove the walls.

But since I'm just starting, maybe it's simpler to get the key and open the door. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right to get the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Move up through the door.
4. Navigate towards the win condition, avoiding or moving walls if necessary.

Wait, but how do I use the key? In Baba Is You, using the key usually involves moving onto the door while holding the key. So, after picking up the key, I can move onto the door to open it.

Let me check the positions again. The key is 1 step right, the door is 1 right and 2 up. So, after getting the key, I can move up twice to reach the door. Then, moving right again would take me through the door.

Once through the door, I can move further up towards the win condition. There might be more walls, but with the key, maybe I can open more doors or manipulate rules to clear the path.

Alternatively, if I can't get through, I might need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching the Baba's position. But the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I need to change that.

To change the rule, I need to move the ""baba"" and ""you"" blocks. The ""rule `baba`"" is 8 steps left and 2 down, and ""rule `you`"" is 6 left and 2 down. If I can move these closer, I can form a new rule.

But that might be complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with the key and door approach for now.

So, the immediate action is to move right to get the key. That should be the first step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a door 2 steps up, which might be a barrier I need to open. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That probably means the key can be used to open the door.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which are likely immovable. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so that's a block I can't move through. The walls are scattered around, creating a sort of maze.

To get to the win condition, I need to move towards it. But the door is in the way. I should pick up the key first. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left to get it. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is 2 steps up. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

Wait, but how do I move? The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. I need to plan my path. Let me outline the steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Move up through the door.
4. Proceed towards the win condition, which is to the right and up.

But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or stop blocks. Let me visualize the map. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once. Then, the door is 2 steps up from my current position. After opening the door, I can move up into the area beyond the door, which should lead me closer to the win condition.

I should also check if there are any other rules I can manipulate. For example, if I can move ""is"" or ""you"" rules to change properties, but right now, the main goal is to get the key and open the door.

So, the immediate action is to move left to get the key. That's the first step towards solving the puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. But there are walls in the way. Let me map out the positions.

The walls are at various positions, but the key seems to be 1 step to the right, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and reach the win.

But wait, how do I get the key? The key is 1 step to the right, but there's a wall in the way. Let me see the walls: there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, another at 3 steps left and 3 up, and so on. It seems like the path to the key is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move some rules to change the properties of the walls.

I notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" 5 steps left and 4 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make walls immovable, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" I could walk through them, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, another approach: if I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" and ""win."" For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move it closer, I might reach it without dealing with the walls. But how?

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step left and 2 up. Maybe the ball can be used to break walls or something, but I'm not sure how that integrates.

Let me think about the movement. I start at the origin, and I need to move towards the key. The key is 1 step right, but there's a wall there. Maybe I can move the wall rule to make that wall stop being a wall. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the wall becomes immovable, but that doesn't help me pass through. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls, but that might not be necessary if I can find another path.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" and ""win."" If I can make ""key is win,"" then when I pick up the key, it would trigger the win condition. That could be a way to bypass the walls. Let me see how to do that.

The ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and then place ""win"" next to that, I could create ""key is win."" But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the same position as the key. That way, when I pick up the key, it would also be the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""win"" rule.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it, which might trigger the win if ""key is win"" is set. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, let me look at the objects again. The door is 1 step right and 2 up. If I can open the door, I might reach the win. But the door is probably locked, requiring the key. So, I need to get the key first.

But the key is 1 step right, and there's a wall blocking the way. Maybe I can move the wall rule to make that wall stop being a wall. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the wall becomes immovable, but that doesn't help me pass through. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls, but that might not be necessary if I can find another path.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move towards the key and see what happens. If I move right, I hit a wall. So, I need to find a way to remove that wall or make it passable.

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop`"" 5 steps left and 4 up. If I can move that to the wall's position, maybe I can make that wall stop being a wall. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the wall becomes immovable, but that doesn't help me pass through. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls, but that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" and ""win."" If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. Let me try that.

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 1 step right and 4 up, and the ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule down to the same level as the key, I can create ""key is win.""

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule down to the same position as the key, then when I pick up the key, it would also be the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win."" That way, picking up the key would trigger the win.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. I can only move text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, I need to see if the ""is"" rule is movable.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 up. I can move it left or right, up or down, as long as it's not blocked. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the left to combine with the ""key"" rule.

If I move the ""is"" rule left by 1 step, it would be at the same position as the ""key"" rule. Then, the ""key"" rule would become ""key is,"" and if I can add ""win"" to that, it would be ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try moving the ""win"" rule to the same position as the key.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""baba"" rule to make myself into the key. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it, which might trigger the win if ""key is win"" is set.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to combine with the ""key"" rule.

I'll move the ""is"" rule left by 1 step to be next to the ""key"" rule. Now, the ""key"" rule becomes ""key is,"" and if I can add ""win"" to that, it would be ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should instead move the ""win"" rule to the same position as the key.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule to the same position as the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""win"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up to the same position as the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 up, and the ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule up by 2 steps, it would be next to the ""win"" rule, creating ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me try to move the ""key"" rule up by 2 steps.

If I do that, the ""key"" rule would be at 2 steps right and 2 up, which is where the door is. That might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to the same position as the key. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 up. If I move it down by 2 steps, it would be at 2 steps right and 2 up, which is where the door is. That might not help.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for other rules that can help me.

I see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step left and 2 up. Maybe the ball can be used to break walls or something. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so when I hit the ball, it triggers the win. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then when I reach the win condition, I win. But I already have ""baba is you,"" so that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" so when I reach the win, I win. But that's already the case.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position. If I can move it closer, I might reach it without dealing with the walls.

But how? The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move it down, I can reach it sooner.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the same position as the key, so picking up the key would win the level.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule down by 2 steps.

If I do that, the ""win"" rule would be at 2 steps right and 2 up, which is where the door is. That might not help.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the same position as the door. Then, when I open the door, I win.

But I'm not sure. Let me try that.

If I move the ""win"" rule down by 2 steps, it would be at 2 steps right and 2 up, which is the door's position. So, when I open the door, I would also trigger the win.

But I need the key to open the door. So, I still need to get the key first.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls. Let me see how to do that.

The ""wall"" rule is 7 steps left and 3 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and then add ""you"" to make ""wall is you.""

But the ""you"" rule is 6 steps left and 2 down. That's far away. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to combine with the ""wall"" and ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the wall's position and then add ""you"" to make ""wall is you.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule left by 6 steps and up by 1 step to be next to the ""wall"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 up. If I move it left by 6 steps, it would be at 5 steps left and 4 up. Then, I can move it down by 1 step to be at 5 steps left and 3 up, which is next to the ""wall"" rule at 7 steps left and 3 up. Hmm, not exactly next to it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to be next to the ""is"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is 7 steps left and 3 up. If I move it right by 6 steps, it would be at 1 step left and 3 up, which is next to the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 4 up. Not exactly, but close.

This seems too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to block the wall, making it stop being a wall. The ""stop"" rule is 5 steps left and 4 up. If I can move it to the wall's position, maybe the wall becomes stop, making it immovable, but that doesn't help me pass through.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the wall becomes immovable, but that doesn't help me pass through.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move towards the key and see what happens. If I move right, I hit a wall. So, I need to find a way to remove that wall or make it passable.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""wall is key,"" then the wall becomes a key, and I can pick it up. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is wall,"" which would make the key a wall, but that doesn't help me get the key.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule to the same position as the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win."" Then, when I pick up the key, I win.

Let me try that. The ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps, it would be next to the ""win"" rule, creating ""key is win.""

But moving the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps would take it to 2 steps right and 4 up, which is where the ""win"" rule is. So, combining them would make ""key is win.""

That sounds promising. Let me try to move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps.

But how? The ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. I need to move it up by 4 steps. Let me see if that's possible.

If I move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps, it would be at 2 steps right and 4 up, which is where the ""win"" rule is. So, combining them would create ""key is win.""

Yes, that should work. So, when I pick up the key, it would trigger the win condition.

But wait, the ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. To move it up by 4 steps, I need to move it from 2 right to 2 right and 4 up. That would place it next to the ""win"" rule, creating ""key is win.""

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps to combine with the ""win"" rule, making ""key is win.""

2. Then, move towards the key, which is now also the win condition.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I can only move text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, I need to make sure the ""key"" rule is movable.

Assuming it is, I can move it up by 4 steps.

Once that's done, picking up the key would win the level.

So, the first step is to move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps.

But wait, the ""key"" rule is at 2 steps right. To move it up by 4 steps, I need to move it to 2 steps right and 4 up, which is where the ""win"" rule is. So, combining them would create ""key is win.""

Yes, that should work.

So, the action would be to move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps.

But in the game, moving a rule involves moving the text block. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps.

But in the context of the game, how do I represent that? I think I need to move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps, which would be the action ""up"" repeated 4 times, but the user can only choose one action at a time.

Wait, no, the user can choose one action per turn. So, I need to plan the sequence of actions to move the ""key"" rule up by 4 steps.

But in the current state, I'm at the origin, and the ""key"" rule is 2 steps right. So, I need to move right twice to reach the ""key"" rule, then move it up by 4 steps.

But I can't move through walls. The path to the ""key"" rule is blocked by walls.

Wait, the wall is at 3 steps left and 4 up, but I'm at the origin. So, moving right twice would take me to 2 steps right, which is where the ""key"" rule is. But is there a wall blocking me?

Looking back, the walls are at various positions, but the key is at 1 step right. So, moving right once would take me to the key's position, but there's a wall there.

Wait, the key is at 1 step right, and there's a wall at 3 steps left and 4 up. So, moving right once would take me to 1 step right, which is where the key is, but is there a wall blocking me?

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps left and 4 up, 3 steps left and 3 up, etc. So, moving right from the origin, I would go to 1 right, which is where the key is, but is there a wall there?

No, the walls are at 3 steps left, so moving right from the origin, I can reach the key at 1 step right without hitting a wall.

Wait, no, the walls are at 3 steps left, so moving right from the origin, I can reach 1 step right without hitting a wall. So, I can move right once to reach the key.

But the key is at 1 step right, and the ""key"" rule is at 2 steps right. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule up by","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first step is to identify where these rule blocks are located because moving them can change the game's rules.

I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To reach it, I need to figure out a path that allows me to move there without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I also see a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need a key to open a door. There's a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to get the key first to open the door and reach the win condition.

But wait, I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be a rule that stops me or something else. I need to be careful about that.

Let me map out the positions:

- Baba is at the starting point, controlled by me.
- The win rule is 2 steps right and 4 up.
- The key rule is 2 steps right.
- The door is 1 step right and 2 up.
- There are walls in various places, which I can't pass through unless I change the rules.

I think the strategy here is to get the key, use it to open the door, and then reach the win condition. But to do that, I might need to move some rule blocks to change the rules, making the walls passable or modifying the win condition.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""rule `wall`"" 7 steps left and 3 up. If I can move this rule, I might be able to change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" I could push through walls. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is nothing,"" they might disappear.

Another important rule is ""rule `is`"" in multiple places. These are the connectors in the rules. I can rearrange them to form new rules.

I also see ""rule `baba`"" 8 steps left and 2 down, ""rule `is`"" 7 steps left and 2 down, and ""rule `you`"" 6 steps left and 2 down. These might be part of the ""baba is you"" rule, which is already active.

So, my plan is:

1. Move towards the key rule to pick it up.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Adjust the wall rules to make the path clear.
4. Proceed to the win condition.

But first, I need to move towards the key. Since the key is 2 steps to the right, I should move right twice. However, I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps left and 4 up, another 3 left and 3 up, etc. It seems the immediate path to the right is clear, so I can move right.

Wait, the key is 2 steps to the right, but I also see a wall 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. I need to make sure that moving right doesn't lead me into a wall. It seems the path is clear, so I can proceed.

So, my first action should be to move right to reach the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key. I see a ""key"" 1 step to the left, and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the key and use it to open the door.

But wait, there are walls all around. The walls are at various positions, and some rules define them. I need to see if I can move any of these walls or rules to create a path. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might be an immovable object. I should avoid that.

I also notice a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps it can be used somehow. But right now, my main focus is getting the key and opening the door to reach the win.

So, my plan is to move towards the key. Since I'm currently at the starting position, I need to figure out how to get to the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, but that's not directly in my way. The immediate area seems clear.

Wait, I'm at the starting point, and the key is 1 step to the left. So, I can just move left once to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can move up to the door and use the key to open it. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up.

But I should also consider if there are any other rules I can manipulate. For example, if I can change the ""win"" rule or create a new one, that might help. However, right now, the simplest path is to get the key, open the door, and reach the win.

So, the first step is to move left to pick up the key. That should set me on the right path to solving the puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

But wait, there are walls and other rules in the way. Let me map out the positions. The ""rule `win`"" is at (2 right, 4 up). The Baba is at the starting point, which I assume is the origin (0,0). So, to reach the win, I need to move right twice and up four times. But I have to check if there are any obstacles or walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls at different positions. For example, a wall is at 3 steps left and 4 steps up. That might be in the way if I try to go straight up. Also, there are other walls at 3 left and 3 up, 3 left and 2 up, etc. So, the path to the win might be blocked by walls.

I also notice there's a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need a key to open a door. There's a door at 1 step right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to get the key first to unlock the door and proceed further.

Let me think about the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. Are there any other rules that can help me? There's a ""rule `stop`"" which might make an object stop movement, but I'm not sure how that affects me yet.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" at 1 step left and 2 steps up. Maybe that's a ball object that can be used somehow, but I'm not sure. There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 7 steps left and 3 steps up, which might define walls as stoppers.

So, my plan is to first move towards the key. The key is 2 steps to the right. So, I should move right twice. But wait, moving right from the origin would take me to (2,0). Is there a wall there? Let me check. There's a wall at 3 steps left and 4 steps up, but that's not in the way. Wait, no, the walls are at 3 left and various up positions, so moving right from (0,0) to (2,0) should be clear.

Once I get the key, I can then approach the door. The door is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. So, after getting the key, I can move up to reach the door and open it.

But wait, do I need to change any rules? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. Maybe I can rearrange some rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make walls passable or change the win condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me by rearranging the text blocks. But that might be more complicated.

Let me focus on the immediate path. Move right twice to get the key, then move up to the door, use the key to open it, and proceed towards the win.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Let me visualize the map. Starting at (0,0), moving right to (2,0) to get the key. Then, moving up to (2,2) where the door is. Using the key to open the door, then moving further up to reach the win at (2,4).

Wait, but the win is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up, which is (2,4). So, after opening the door, I can move up to (2,4) to win.

But I need to make sure that the path from (2,2) to (2,4) is clear. Are there any walls there? Let me check. There's a wall at 3 left and 4 up, which is (-3,4), so that's not in the way. The walls are mostly on the left side, so the right side might be clearer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls. Let me see. From (0,0), moving up four steps would take me to (0,4), but there's a wall at 3 left and 4 up, which is (-3,4), so that's not blocking me. But I need to get to (2,4), so moving right twice after moving up might be an option.

But I think the key is necessary to open the door, so I should prioritize getting it.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right twice to get the key at (2,0).
2. Move up to (2,2) to reach the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Move up further to (2,4) to reach the win.

But I need to check if moving up from (2,0) to (2,2) is possible. Are there any walls in that path? Let me see. There's a wall at 3 left and 2 up, which is (-3,2), so that's not in the way. The path from (2,0) to (2,2) seems clear.

Wait, but there's a wall at 3 left and 1 up, which is (-3,1), so that's not blocking me either.

So, the plan is feasible. I'll start by moving right twice to get the key.

Wait, there's a ""door"" 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Doors usually require a key to open. So, if I can get the key and then approach the door, I might be able to pass through. But first, I need to get the key.

The key is 1 step to the left. Since I'm Baba, I can move left to pick it up. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Let me check the walls. There are walls at various positions, but I think the path to the key is clear.

Once I have the key, I can move towards the door. After opening the door, I should be able to proceed towards the win condition. But I also need to consider the other rules. For example, there's a ""rule `stop`"" which might prevent me from moving if I'm not careful.

I should also look at the ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break things, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `baba`"" 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe that's a way to change Baba's properties, but since I'm already Baba, I might not need to do that right now.

So, the plan is: move left to get the key, then move right towards the door, use the key to open the door, and then proceed to the win condition. Let me check the exact positions again to make sure I can move without hitting any walls.

I think the path is clear. So, the first step is to move left to pick up the key.

Next, I need to figure out how to get there. The path might be blocked by walls, so I should check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up, but I'm not sure exactly how they're arranged. I might need to move around them or break through them if possible.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object two steps to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door or change a rule. The door is one step to the right and two steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

Another important rule is ""rule `stop` 5 step to the left and 4 step up."" This probably means that if I move five steps left and four steps up, I'll hit a stop block, which might prevent me from moving further in that direction. I should avoid that unless it's necessary.

I also see ""rule `wall` 7 step to the left and 3 step up."" This suggests that moving seven steps left and three steps up will create a wall, which could block my path. I need to be cautious about that.

Looking at the ""baba"" rule, it's eight steps to the left and two steps down. That might be a way to reset or change my position, but I'm not sure yet.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. If I can get the key, it might help me unlock the door and reach the win condition. So, I'll try moving right to get the key. Once I have the key, I can then move towards the door and proceed to the win.

Alternatively, if moving right is blocked by walls, I might need to rearrange some rules. For example, if I can move a ""wall"" rule to create a path, that would help. But since I'm just starting, I'll try the straightforward approach first.

So, I'll start by moving right to get the key. If that's blocked, I'll have to think of another strategy, maybe moving up or down to find a different path.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. The ""stop"" rule is positioned 5 steps left and 4 steps up. There's a wall nearby, which might block my movement. The ""is"" and ""win"" rules are to the right, which could be important for changing the rules.

I notice there's a ""key"" object two steps to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is one step to the right and two steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed further.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are positioned in such a way that they might block my path. I need to see if I can move any of the rule blocks to change the environment. For example, if I can move a ""wall"" rule, I might be able to make a wall passable or create a new path.

I also see a ""ball"" rule one step left and two steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change the rules. The ""baba"" rule is eight steps left and two steps down, which is far from my current position. I might need to move towards that if I need to change my own properties.

The ""you"" rule is six steps left and two steps down. If I can manipulate this, maybe I can change who I am or what I can do. But I'm not sure how that would help right now.

I think the immediate goal is to get the key to open the door. To do that, I need to move right. But I have to check if the path is clear. The walls are at 3 steps left and various up positions, so moving right might be possible if I can navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move some rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or move more freely. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push,"" I could push the walls out of the way.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me see if I can move any rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is one step right and four steps up, which is close to the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" block next to another subject, I can create a new rule.

Wait, the ""key"" is two steps to the right. If I can move towards it, I can pick it up. Let me plan my movement. I need to move right twice to get the key. But are there walls blocking that path? The walls are at 3 steps left, so moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the origin) should be clear.

So, my first action should be to move right to get closer to the key. That way, I can pick it up and then proceed to the door. Once I have the key, I can open the door and potentially reach the win condition.

Alternatively, if the door requires the key to be used, I might need to move towards the door after getting the key. But I need to make sure the path is clear. The door is one step to the right and two steps up, so after getting the key, I can move up to reach it.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get the key. That will give me the tool I need to progress further in the level. Once I have the key, I can focus on opening the door and reaching the win condition.

So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there are several walls and other rules. The walls are placed in various positions, some of which might block my path. I need to see if I can move any rules or objects to change the environment.

There's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can use the key to open a door. The door is 2 steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed further.

But wait, the key is 1 step to the left, and the rule `key` is 1 step to the right. I'm a bit confused about how that works. Maybe I need to move the key rule closer to me so I can pick it up.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the key or the door.

The walls are positioned in a way that might create a barrier. I see a ""rule `wall`"" 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule, I might be able to create a path or remove a wall.

I'm also noticing that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. These could be used to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to another object, I can redefine its properties.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the win condition is to the right and up. There are walls blocking the direct path, so I need to find an alternative route.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" to make the key into something else, like a pushable object. Or perhaps I can make the key into a ""you"" so I can control it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule next to an ""is"" to create a new rule that allows me to push walls or something.

Wait, if I can make the ball into a ""you,"" I could use it to push the key or the door. But I'm not sure how that would work exactly.

Another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to prevent certain objects from moving or blocking my path. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is far from me, so maybe that's not immediately useful.

I think the key is to get the key to open the door. So, I need to figure out how to reach the key. The key is 1 step to the left, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can break the wall by creating a new rule.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the wall, I can redefine it. For example, making the wall into a ""push"" or ""breakable"" object. But I'm not sure how that would work in this context.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" next to the wall and use it to break through. If the ball can push the wall, that would create a path.

Wait, the ball is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move the ball to the position of the key, maybe I can push the key into a useful position.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. Identify the win condition: ""rule `win`"" is 1 step right and 4 up. I need to get there.

2. Obstacles: walls are blocking the direct path. There's a door 2 steps up, which might require a key.

3. Key is 1 step left, but it's behind a wall. The rule `key` is 1 step right. Maybe I can move the key rule to make the key accessible.

4. Ball is 2 left and 2 up. Maybe use the ball to break through walls or push objects.

5. There are multiple ""is"" rules that can be used to create new rules.

Perhaps the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule next to the key to create a new rule, like ""key is push"" or ""key is you."" That way, I can control the key and move it to the door.

Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" next to the key to create a ""ball is key"" rule, which might allow me to use the ball to pick up the key.

Wait, if I can make the ball into a key, then I can use it to open the door. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the position of the ball, then move the key next to it.

Alternatively, I can move the key next to the ball and then use an ""is"" rule to combine them.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to the key first.

Looking at the map, the ""is"" rule is 4 steps up, which is directly above me. If I move up, I can reach it. Then, I can carry it to the key's position.

So, the plan is:

1. Move up to get the ""is"" rule.

2. Carry the ""is"" rule to the key's position (1 step left).

3. Place the ""is"" rule next to the key to create a new rule, like ""key is push"" or ""key is you.""

4. Use the new rule to move the key to the door.

5. Open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" next to the key to create a ""ball is key"" rule, which would allow me to use the ball to pick up the key.

But I'm not sure how that would work in terms of movement.

Another idea: if I can make the wall into a ""stop"" object, it would block movement, but that might not help.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 6 steps left and 4 up. If I can move it to block a path, but that seems far away.

I think the key is to focus on getting the key to open the door. So, I need to find a way to move the key or make it accessible.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the wall to make it breakable. For example, ""wall is break."" Then, I can break through the wall to reach the key.

But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current rules.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" next to the wall to create a ""ball is break"" rule, allowing me to break the wall with the ball.

But again, I'm not sure how that would work.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule next to the key to create a new rule that allows me to control the key or make it movable.

So, I'll try moving up to get the ""is"" rule, then move left to place it next to the key.

Once the ""is"" rule is next to the key, I can create a new rule like ""key is you,"" which would allow me to control the key.

Then, I can move the key to the door to open it.

After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

So, the steps are:

1. Move up to get the ""is"" rule.

2. Move left to place the ""is"" rule next to the key.

3. Create the rule ""key is you.""

4. Move the key to the door.

5. Open the door and move towards the win condition.

I think that's a feasible plan. Now, I'll try to execute it step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The ""WIN"" rule is located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That seems like my target. But before I can get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I notice there are multiple walls and rule blocks. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can change how movement works. Also, there's a ""key"" and a ""door,"" which might be part of a puzzle where I need to unlock something.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and the ""rule key"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move the key to interact with the door. But how does that help me reach the win condition?

I also see a ""ball"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Maybe if I can make the ball do something, like push a wall or change a rule, it could help clear a path.

Let me think about the movement. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since the win is to the right and up, I might need to move in that direction. But there are walls in the way. Are there any rules I can change to make those walls passable?

The ""wall"" rule is 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here, so that might not work.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but that's probably already the case. Maybe I can break the wall rule by moving the ""is"" or ""wall"" parts.

Looking at the ""is"" rules, there are several. If I can move an ""is"" to combine with another word, I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" could change the win condition.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make ""win is you,"" then I would win when I reach that point. But I already am ""you"" because of ""baba is you."" Maybe that's not necessary.

Another idea: the ""key"" is near me. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can unlock the door. The door is 1 step up. If I move up, I might hit the door. But without the key, I can't open it. So I need to get the key first.

The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So I need to move left and down to get it. But is that path clear? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up, but I'm not sure how that affects my path.

Wait, the walls are placed in a way that might block my movement. I need to see if I can move around them or change the rules to make them passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to block myself or others. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Let me try to plan a path. I need to get the key, which is down and left. Then, I can go back up to the door. But I have to make sure I can move through any walls in the way.

If I move left and down, I might encounter walls. If I can't pass through them, I need to find another way. Maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls won't block me. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule either.

Hmm, maybe I can break the wall rule by moving the ""wall"" or ""is"" parts. For example, if I move the ""wall"" part next to something else, the rule might change.

Let me look at the ""wall"" rule again. It's 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""wall"" part to combine with another word, I can redefine walls. For example, moving it next to ""stop"" would make ""wall is stop,"" which might make walls stop movement, but that's probably already the case.

Alternatively, moving it next to ""you"" would make ""wall is you,"" which would mean I can walk through walls. That sounds promising! If I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, and I could walk through them.

So, how can I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule part to be next to ""you."" The ""you"" rule is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So I need to move the ""wall"" part there.

But moving the ""wall"" rule part requires breaking the existing rule. I can move the ""wall"" part by moving the rule block. So I need to move the ""wall"" rule from 8 steps left and 2 up to next to ""you.""

That would involve moving it 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. But that's a lot of steps, and I might get blocked by other walls or rules along the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" part to the ""wall"" rule. The ""you"" rule is 7 left and 3 down. The ""wall"" rule is 8 left and 2 up. So moving ""you"" up 5 steps and right 1 step would place it next to ""wall.""

But again, that's a lot of movement, and I might not have the space to do that without getting stuck.

Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think about the key and door again. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me to the win condition.

The key is 1 left and 1 down. So I can move left and down to pick it up. Then, I can move up to the door and use the key to open it.

But I need to make sure that the path to the key is clear. Let me check the walls around that area. There's a wall 4 left and 3 up, but I'm not sure if that blocks my path.

Wait, the walls are placed at various positions, but I'm not sure how they're arranged. Maybe I can move around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ""ball"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. If I can make the ball do something, like push a wall, it might clear a path.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work. Maybe I can make the ball into a key or something else.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 1 right and 1 down. If I can move the ""key"" part next to ""ball,"" I can make ""key is ball,"" which might allow me to use the ball as a key.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe I can just move the key to the door.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move left and down to pick up the key.
2. Move up to the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed to the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move in those directions without being blocked. Let me check the walls again.

The walls are placed at various positions, but I'm not sure if they block my path to the key. If they do, I might need to change the rules to make them passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls out of the way by changing the rules. For example, making ""wall is push"" would allow me to push them, but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" part. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""push"" would create ""is is push,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" would make ""is is stop,"" which also doesn't help.

Alternatively, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" would make ""is is win,"" which might change the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can reach the key without changing any rules.

I need to move left and down. Let me check if that path is clear. If there are walls in the way, I might need to go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key to a more accessible location. The ""key"" rule is 1 right and 1 down. If I can move that rule part next to the key object, I can make ""key is key,"" which doesn't change anything. Maybe moving it elsewhere could help.

Wait, if I can move the ""key"" rule part next to ""you,"" making ""key is you,"" then I would be the key, which might allow me to open the door without picking up the key.

But I'm not sure if that works. Let me think about it. If ""key is you,"" then when I reach the door, since I am the key, the door would open automatically.

That could be a way to bypass picking up the key. So, how can I move the ""key"" rule part next to ""you""?

The ""key"" rule is 1 right and 1 down. The ""you"" rule is 7 left and 3 down. So I need to move the ""key"" part 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down to be next to ""you.""

That's a lot of movement, and I might get blocked. Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" part to the ""key"" rule.

But moving rule parts is tricky because I can only move them if they're not part of a rule. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can move any object, including rule parts, as long as they're not fixed.

So, I can try to move the ""key"" rule part to be next to ""you."" Let me plan that.

First, I need to move the ""key"" rule part from 1 right and 1 down to 7 left and 3 down, where ""you"" is. That would require moving it 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down.

But I'm not sure if I can do that in one move. Maybe I can move it step by step, but each move would require an action.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule part to the ""key"" rule. That would involve moving ""you"" from 7 left and 3 down to 1 right and 1 down, which is also a lot of steps.

This seems too time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me think about the win condition again. The ""win"" rule is 1 right and 3 up. If I can reach that point, I win. So maybe I can find a path to it without dealing with the door and key.

But there are walls in the way. Let me see if I can move the walls or change the rules to make them passable.

The ""wall"" rule is 8 left and 2 up. If I can move that rule part to redefine walls, I might be able to walk through them.

For example, if I make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, making ""wall is pass"" would allow me to walk through them, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule either.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" part. If I move ""is"" next to ""pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall"" rule by moving the ""wall"" or ""is"" part away. If I move the ""wall"" part away, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, and walls would no longer stop me.

So, if I can move the ""wall"" part from 8 left and 2 up to somewhere else, the rule would be broken, and walls would lose their stopping property.

That sounds promising. So, how can I move the ""wall"" part?

I need to move it to a location where it's not part of a rule. Maybe I can move it next to another word to create a new rule.

For example, moving it next to ""you"" would make ""wall is you,"" which would mean I can walk through walls. That would solve the problem of walls blocking my path.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""wall"" rule part from 8 left and 2 up to next to ""you"" at 7 left and 3 down.

But that's a long distance. Let me see if I can do it step by step.

First, I need to move the ""wall"" part right and down. Each move would require an action. So, moving it right 1 step would bring it to 7 left and 2 up. Then, moving it down 1 step to 7 left and 1 up, and so on, until it reaches 7 left and 3 down, next to ""you.""

But that would take several moves, and I might get stuck if other walls block the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" part to the ""wall"" rule. That would involve moving ""you"" from 7 left and 3 down to 8 left and 2 up, making ""you is wall."" But that would mean I become a wall, which might not help.

Wait, if ""you is wall,"" then I would be a wall, and I couldn't move. That's not good. So, better to make ""wall is you"" so that walls become me and I can walk through them.

So, I need to move the ""wall"" part to be next to ""you."" Let me try to do that.

First, move the ""wall"" part right 1 step to 7 left and 2 up.

Then, move it right again to 6 left and 2 up.

Continue moving it right until it's at 1 right and 2 up.

Then, move it down to 1 right and 3 up, and so on, until it's next to ""you"" at 7 left and 3 down.

Wait, that's not efficient. Maybe I can move it diagonally, but in Baba Is You, you can only move in four directions, one step at a time.

So, each move would be either up, down, left, or right.

This seems too time-consuming, and I might not have the space to move the ""wall"" part without getting blocked.

Maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the key and door again.

If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me to the win condition. So, let's try that.

The key is 1 left and 1 down. So, I need to move left and down to pick it up.

But I need to make sure that path is clear. Let me check the walls around that area.

There's a wall 4 left and 3 up, but I'm not sure if that affects my path to the key. Maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, if I can break the wall rule, I can walk through walls. But that requires moving the ""wall"" part, which is time-consuming.

Maybe I can try to move the key to a more accessible location. The ""key"" rule is 1 right and 1 down. If I can move that rule part next to the key object, I can make ""key is key,"" which doesn't help. Maybe moving it elsewhere could help.

Wait, if I can move the ""key"" rule part next to ""you,"" making ""key is you,"" then I would be the key, and I could open the door without picking up the key.

That could be a way to bypass the key. So, how can I move the ""key"" rule part next to ""you""?

The ""key"" rule is 1 right and 1 down. The ""you"" rule is 7 left and 3 down. So, I need to move the ""key"" part 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down.

That's a lot of movement, but let's try.

First, move the ""key"" part left 1 step to 0 right and 1 down.

Then, left again to 1 left and 1 down.

Continue moving left until it's at 7 left and 1 down.

Then, move it down 2 steps to 7 left and 3 down, next to ""you.""

Now, the rule becomes ""key is you,"" meaning I am the key. So, when I reach the door, it should open automatically.

That seems promising. So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""key"" rule part from 1 right and 1 down to 7 left and 3 down, next to ""you.""

This would make ""key is you,"" so I become the key.

2. Once that's done, I can move to the door, which is 1 step up, and it should open because I am the key.

3. After opening the door, I can proceed to the win condition, which is 1 right and 3 up.

But wait, after moving the ""key"" rule part, I need to make sure that the new rule is active. So, I have to perform the action to move the ""key"" part.

But in the game, moving rule parts requires moving the actual blocks. So, I need to move the ""key"" block to be next to ""you.""

Each move would require an action. So, moving the ""key"" block left 8 steps and down 2 steps would take 10 actions, which is a lot.

But maybe there's a shortcut. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" block to the ""key"" rule. That would involve moving ""you"" from 7 left and 3 down to 1 right and 1 down, making ""you is key.""

But that would mean I am the key, same as before. So, either way, I need to move one of the blocks to create the ""key is you"" rule.

This seems like the most straightforward way to solve the puzzle. So, I'll proceed with moving the ""key"" block to be next to ""you.""

First, I'll move the ""key"" block left 8 steps and down 2 steps. Each move is one action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current state of the level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the properties of other objects. My first thought is to identify where the ""WIN"" rule is because that's what I need to reach or change.

From the observation, the ""rule `win`"" is located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That seems like a good target because if I can reach that position, I might be able to interact with it. But before I move, I should check if there are any obstacles or other rules that could affect my movement.

I notice there are several walls around, especially to the left and up. The walls are placed in such a way that they might block my path. For example, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which is directly in the path if I try to move up. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have a ""STOP"" property. Wait, looking back, I see a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 3 steps up. That means if I move into that area, I might be stopped.

Hmm, maybe I should try to move around the walls. Let me visualize the map. The ""rule `win`"" is 1 step right and 3 steps up. To get there, I might need to move up first, but the walls are in the way. Alternatively, I could try moving right first to avoid the walls.

Wait, there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can pick up the key to unlock something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. My priority is to reach the ""WIN"" rule.

Let me think about the possible movements. If I move up, I might hit a wall. If I move right, I can get closer to the ""WIN"" rule. Let me try moving right first. So, the action would be ""right.""

But before I commit, I should check if moving right is possible without hitting any walls. The walls are mostly to the left, so moving right might be clear. Alternatively, moving up could be blocked, so moving right seems safer.

Another consideration is the ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's not relevant right now. I should focus on reaching the ""WIN"" rule.

So, to summarize, I need to move towards the ""WIN"" rule, which is to the right and up. Since moving right first might be less obstructed, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first thought is to see if I can manipulate these rules to make progress.

I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To reach it, I need to figure out how to get there without being blocked by walls. There are walls around, so I need to see if I can move any rule blocks to change the environment.

I also see a ""rule `key`"" 1 step down. Maybe I can use the key to open a door or change a rule. The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and access the win condition.

But wait, the door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, and the key is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. That seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can move the key closer or change the door's properties.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break walls, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Another important rule is ""rule `stop`"" 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move this rule, I might be able to stop certain objects or change their behavior.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but walls are blocking my path. Maybe if I can make the walls into something else, like ""you"" or ""win,"" I can pass through them.

Looking at the ""rule `wall`"" 9 steps to the left and 2 steps up, if I can change this rule, I might be able to redefine what walls are. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" I could push them aside. Or if I make ""wall is you,"" I could walk through them.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" So I need to check if any of the rule blocks are movable. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are probably essential and might not be movable, but I can try moving the ""rule `stop`"" or ""rule `win`"" if possible.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move it, I might be able to stop certain objects or change their behavior. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing rule blocks. For example, if I can move ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `win`,"" I might create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition something I can interact with.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move the key closer, I can pick it up and use it to open the door.

Wait, the door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can get the key there, I can open the door and reach the win condition. But the key is further down, so I need to figure out a path to get there.

I also notice that there are multiple walls around, which are blocking my path. Maybe I can move some of the rule blocks to change the walls into something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push them aside.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to see if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" block to redefine walls. If I can move it next to another rule, like ""is push,"" I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""rule `wall`"" to change the wall's properties. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being where the win condition is. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""rule `win`"" block.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is 3 steps up. If I can move it next to ""is you,"" I can make ""win is you,"" which would mean wherever I am is the win condition. That could be a way to win without moving much.

But how do I move the ""rule `win`"" block? I need to check if it's movable. Since it's a rule block, it might be possible to move it if it's not defined as ""stop.""

I think the best approach is to try moving the ""rule `win`"" block to redefine the win condition. If I can make ""win is you,"" then I can win by being anywhere, which would solve the puzzle.

So, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" block to a position where it can form a new rule with ""is you."" That would require moving it next to the ""rule `is`"" block that's 1 step to the left and 3 steps up.

But I'm not sure how to move it. Maybe I can push it using other objects or by redefining the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""rule `win`"" to create ""win is you."" That would change the win condition to wherever I am.

I think that's the way to go. So, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""rule `win`"" block. Let me see how to do that.

The ""rule `is`"" block is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. The ""rule `win`"" is 3 steps up. So, if I can move the ""rule `is`"" block to the right by 2 steps, it would be next to the ""rule `win`"" block.

But how do I move the ""rule `is`"" block? I need to check if it's movable. Since it's a rule block, it might be possible to move it if it's not defined as ""stop.""

I think I can try moving it. So, I'll move the ""rule `is`"" block 2 steps to the right, which would place it next to the ""rule `win`"" block. That should create the new rule ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition.

Once that's done, I can win by being anywhere on the map, which should solve the puzzle.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Move the ""rule `is`"" block 2 steps to the right to be next to the ""rule `win`"" block.
2. This creates the new rule ""win is you.""
3. Now, wherever I am on the map, I can win.

But wait, I'm not sure if moving the ""rule `is`"" block is allowed. Maybe it's fixed in place. If that's the case, I need another approach.

Alternatively, I can try moving the ""rule `win`"" block to be next to the ""rule `is`"" block. That would also create ""win is you.""

So, I'll try moving the ""rule `win`"" block 1 step to the left to be next to the ""rule `is`"" block.

If that works, then the new rule is created, and I can win.

I think that's the best course of action. So, I'll move the ""rule `win`"" block 1 step to the left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a door, a key, and the Baba and you rules. The ""win"" rule is located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That seems like my target. But to get there, I might need to move through the map, possibly using keys to open doors or rearranging rules to change the environment.

I notice there's a key 1 step to the left and 1 step down. There's also a door 1 step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open the door. But wait, the door is at 1 step up, and the key is down. So I might need to move down to get the key, then up to open the door.

But before I can do that, I need to make sure I can move freely. Are there any walls blocking my path? The walls are positioned in various places, but I think I can navigate around them. Let me visualize the map:

- The Baba is at the starting point.
- The key is to the left and down.
- The door is up.
- The win condition is to the right and up.

So, the plan is: move left to get the key, then up to the door, use the key to open the door, and then proceed to the win condition.

But wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes you can change the rules by moving text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules, I might be able to change what Baba can do or what the win condition is. However, in this case, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which is straightforward.

I should check if there are any other rules that could help. There's a ""stop"" rule, but I don't see it being used here. The ""wall"" rules define what's a wall, but unless I can change those, they'll block me. The ""ball"" rule is there, but I don't see a ball object, so maybe it's not relevant.

I think the key is the main obstacle here. I need to get it to open the door. So, my first move should be to go left to reach the key. Let me see how many steps I need to move left. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. So, I should move left once and down once to get the key.

Wait, but if I move down, will there be a wall blocking me? Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 1 step down. So, if I'm moving left once and down once, I might hit that wall. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall. Let me see: if I move up, I can go towards the door, but the key is down. Maybe I need to find another way around. Or perhaps I can break the wall by changing the rules, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is defined as 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, I might be able to change what counts as a wall. But that seems like a more advanced strategy, and I'm just starting out.

I think the simplest approach is to try to get the key. So, I'll move left once and down once to reach the key. Let me check if that's possible without hitting a wall. The wall is 4 steps to the left and 1 step down, so if I'm only moving 1 step left and 1 step down, I should be okay.

Once I have the key, I can move up to the door and open it. Then, I can proceed to the win condition, which is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That should be the path.

So, my first action should be to move left to start heading towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere in that area. There's also a door 1 step to the right and 1 step up, which might be a barrier I need to open. The key is 1 step down, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. That probably means the key can be used to open the door.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which are likely immovable. The ""rule `ball`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step up, but I'm not sure how that plays into this level. There are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around, which might be used to create new rules by moving them.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't pass through walls or ""stop"" blocks. The key is nearby, so maybe I should pick it up first. Once I have the key, I can open the door to reach the win condition.

Let me plan my path. I need to move towards the key, which is 1 step down. So, from my current position, I should go down. After picking up the key, I can move right towards the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so I'll need to go up after moving right.

Wait, but the door is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up, and the key is 1 step down. So, I need to go down to get the key, then up to reach the door. That makes sense. Once I have the key, I can interact with the door to open it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first to get closer to the door, but the key is down, so I need to go down first. Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, moving down will take me to the key. Then, moving right and up will take me to the door. After opening the door, I can proceed to the win block.

I should also check if there are any other rules I can manipulate. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to another object, I might create a new rule that helps me. But in this case, the key and door seem straightforward. I don't see an immediate need to change the rules unless I'm blocked by something else.

So, the plan is: move down to get the key, then move right and up to the door, use the key to open it, and then proceed to the win block. Let me start by moving down to pick up the key.

There's also a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key.

- The win rule is up and to the right.
- The door is in the way, requiring a key.
- The key is to the left and down.

So, the path seems clear if I move left, down, pick up the key, then up and right to the door, and then to the win. I should start by moving left to get closer to the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there are several walls and other rules. The walls are placed in various positions, so I need to avoid them or find a way around. There's a door two steps to the right and two steps up, which might be useful if I can unlock it with a key. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I can pick that up first.

Wait, the key is only one step to the right. If I move right once, I can get the key. Then, with the key, I can open the door. Once the door is open, I can move through it towards the win condition.

But I also see a ""rule `stop`"" which is four steps to the left and four steps up. I need to make sure I don't run into that, as it might block my path or stop me from moving. Similarly, there are other rules like ""rule `ball`"" and ""rule `key`"" that might affect how objects behave.

I should also consider if there are any other rules I can manipulate. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules, I might change how Baba behaves. But right now, the main rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can focus on moving Baba towards the win.

So, the plan is: move right to get the key, then use the key to open the door, and proceed towards the win condition. Let me check the positions again to make sure I'm not missing anything.

The key is one step to the right, so moving right once should get it. Then, the door is two steps to the right and two steps up. After getting the key, I can move up twice and right once more to reach the door. Once through the door, I can move up to reach the win.

I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The walls are mostly on the left side, so as long as I move right and up, I should avoid them. Also, the ""rule `stop`"" is far to the left, so it shouldn't interfere if I move right.

Another thing to consider: are there any other objects or rules that could help or hinder me? The ""rule `ball`"" is two steps up, but I'm not sure how that affects things. Maybe it's just a distraction. I'll focus on the key and door for now.

Alright, I think the best first move is to go right to pick up the key. That should set me up to open the door and proceed towards the win.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" which might be an immovable object. I need to avoid that or use it to my advantage. Maybe I can move some text blocks to change the rules.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the key. That's 2 steps to the right. But I have to make sure there are no walls in the way.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is above me. Another wall 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up. So, moving right, I might not hit any walls immediately. Let me try moving right twice to get the key.

After opening the door, the path should be clear to the win condition, which is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, I need to move up four steps and right two steps from my starting point, but I have to go via the key and door.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls. Let me see. If I move up four steps, I might hit the wall at 3 steps left and 4 up. Hmm, maybe I should move right first to get the key, then up.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange some rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule to change what Baba is. But since I'm Baba, I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" I need to see if I can move any rules to create a new path.

But perhaps it's simpler to just move towards the key and door. Let me try moving right twice to get the key. That should allow me to open the door and proceed to the win.

So, my plan is: move right twice to get the key, then up two steps and right one step to open the door, then up two more steps and right one step to reach the win.

Wait, but in the current map, the key is 2 steps to the right. So, moving right twice should get me there. Let me confirm the positions.

Yes, the key is at 2 steps right. So, moving right twice should work. Then, from there, I can move up two steps and right one to the door. Then, up two more steps and right one to the win.

I think that's the path. So, the first step is to move right twice. But since I can only take one action at a time, I'll choose the first move: right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That might mean that the key is defined as something, maybe as a tool to open doors.

I also notice a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That could be an obstacle that stops movement. There are several walls around, which are immovable since they're defined as ""wall."" I need to be careful not to move into them.

The ""rule `ball`"" is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does, but maybe it's part of the puzzle. There's also a ""rule `baba`"" 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down, which might be another instance of Baba or a different rule involving Baba.

I think the key is to get the key first to open the door. So, I should move towards the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I'll move left. Once I have the key, I can move up to the door and open it. After that, I can proceed towards the win condition.

Wait, but I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall or the stop rule. Let me check the positions. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. So, moving left once should be safe. I'll go left to pick up the key.

After getting the key, I can move up to the door. The door is 2 steps up, so I'll move up twice. Once through the door, I can head towards the win condition, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. I'll need to move right once and then up four times, avoiding any walls or stop rules along the way.

I should also be cautious of the ""rule `stop`"" that's 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I end up near that area, I might get stopped, so I need to plan my path carefully to avoid it.

In summary, my plan is:
1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move up to open the door.
3. Move right and up towards the win condition, avoiding walls and stop rules.

I think moving left is the first step to get the key, so I'll choose the left action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there are walls and other rules. The walls are immovable because they have the ""stop"" property. So, I can't move through them. The key is two steps to the right, which might be useful for opening a door. The door is one step to the right and two steps up, so maybe I need the key to open it.

Wait, but the door is in the way of the win condition. So, I need to get the key first. The key is two steps to the right, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the layout:

- The win rule is two steps right and four up.
- The door is one step right and two up.
- The key is two steps right.

So, to get the key, I need to move right twice. But are there any walls blocking that path? Let me check the walls:

- There's a wall three steps left and four up, which is probably on the left side.
- Another wall three steps left and three up, and so on. It seems the walls are on the left, so moving right might be clear.

Wait, but the key is two steps to the right. So, moving right twice should get me to the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which is one step right and two up. Then, I can proceed towards the win condition.

But I also see a ""rule `ball`"" one step left and two up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's not relevant right now. The main focus is getting the key and opening the door.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right twice to pick up the key.
2. Move up two steps to reach the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Move towards the win condition.

But wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes you can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules, I might change the game's mechanics. However, right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can't change that unless I move the ""is"" or ""you"" blocks.

Looking at the rules, there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can rearrange them to create a new rule, like ""key is you"" or something else. But that might complicate things. Since the key is needed to open the door, it's probably better to just get the key first.

So, the immediate action is to move right twice to get the key. Let me check if that's possible without hitting any walls. The walls are on the left, so moving right should be clear.

Therefore, the best course of action is to move right twice to pick up the key.

I notice there are several walls and ""stop"" rules, which likely make those walls immovable. The ""ball"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up, but I'm not sure how that affects things yet.

I think the key is to move towards the win condition. Since the win is up and to the right, I should probably move up first. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The door is 2 steps up, so I might need the key to open it. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should go get that first.

Wait, but if I move left, I might get closer to the key. Let me see: the key is 1 step to the left, so moving left once would get me to the key. Then, I can move up to the door and use the key to open it, allowing me to reach the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the door and win. But without the key, I might be blocked by the door. So, getting the key first seems necessary.

So, my plan is: move left to get the key, then move up to the door, use the key to open the door, and then move up to the win.

But wait, in the current position, moving left would take me to the key. Let me check the exact positions. The key is 1 step to the left, so moving left once would get me there. Then, moving up twice would take me to the door, which I can open with the key. After that, moving up once more would reach the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the door, but without the key, I can't open it. So, getting the key first is better.

So, the first step is to move left to pick up the key. That way, I can proceed to the door and then to the win.

Wait, but in the current observation, the key is 1 step to the left, and the rule `key` is 1 step to the right. So, maybe moving right once would get me to the rule `key`, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. I think the key itself is the important part, so moving left to get the key is the right move.

So, I'll choose to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I notice there are walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and up. There's also a door and a key. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, and the key is 2 steps to the right. So, maybe I need the key to open the door.

But wait, the door is at 1 step right and 2 up, and the key is 2 steps right. So, I might need to move right to get the key, then go back to the door. But I also have to consider the walls. There are walls blocking some paths, so I need to navigate around them.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" which might be a throwable object, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps left and 4 up, which might be an immovable object.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. But right now, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" So, I can't change other rules unless I move the text blocks.

Wait, maybe I can move some rules to change the properties. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Let me plan my path. I need to get to the win condition at 2 right and 4 up. To get there, I might need to go up first, avoiding the walls. Let me see the walls: at 3 left and 4 up, 3 left and 3 up, etc. So, moving up from my starting position, I might hit a wall. Maybe I should move right first to avoid the walls.

If I move right, I can get closer to the key and the door. The key is 2 steps right, so moving right twice would get me to the key. Then, I can pick up the key and go back to the door. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

But wait, do I need to open the door? Or is the door just another obstacle? I'm not sure. Maybe the door is blocking the path to the win condition, so I need to open it with the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can go up first, avoiding the walls, and then move right to reach the win condition. Let me visualize the map. Starting at the origin, moving up 4 steps would take me to the win condition, but there are walls in the way. So, I need to find a path around them.

Perhaps moving right first to get past the walls, then up. Let me try that. Move right once, then up, but I need to check if there are walls blocking that path. The walls are at 3 left and various up positions, so moving right might help me avoid them.

Wait, the walls are at 3 left, so if I move right, I'm moving away from the walls. That could be a good strategy. So, moving right a few times to get past the walls, then moving up to reach the win condition.

But I also have the key and door to consider. The key is 2 steps right, and the door is 1 step right and 2 up. So, if I move right twice, I get the key, then I can go back left once to the door, use the key to open it, and then proceed up.

Alternatively, maybe the door isn't necessary, and I can just go around. But it's safer to assume that the door is a required step to reach the win condition.

So, my plan is: move right twice to get the key, then left once to the door, use the key to open the door, then move up to reach the win condition.

But wait, can I carry the key? Since I'm Baba, I can pick up the key. So, moving right twice to get the key, then left once to the door, then up.

But I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at 3 left and various up positions, so moving right should take me away from them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first, but I might hit a wall. So, moving right first seems better.

Another thought: the ""rule `stop`"" is 5 left and 4 up, which is probably an immovable object. So, I need to avoid that.

In summary, the steps I need to take are:

1. Move right twice to get the key.
2. Move left once to reach the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Move up to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure that each move is possible without hitting walls. Let me check the positions again.

Starting position: let's assume it's at (0,0).

After moving right twice: (2,0). That's where the key is.

Then, moving left once: (1,0). That's where the door is.

Then, moving up: from (1,0) to (1,1), (1,2), etc., up to (1,4) where the win condition is.

But wait, the win condition is at 2 right and 4 up, which would be (2,4). So, after opening the door, I need to move up to (1,4), then right once to (2,4).

Alternatively, maybe the door is at (1,2), so after opening it, I can move up to (1,4), then right to (2,4).

I think that's the path. So, the actions I need to take are:

1. right
2. right
3. left
4. up (to open the door)
5. up
6. up
7. up
8. right

But I need to make sure that each step is possible. Let me check for walls.

At (2,0): key, no wall.

At (1,0): door, no wall.

At (1,1): wall? Let me check the objects. The walls are at 3 left and various up positions, so (1,1) is probably clear.

Wait, the walls are at 3 left, which is (-3, y). So, moving right from (0,0) to (2,0) is clear.

Then, moving left to (1,0), which is the door.

After opening the door, moving up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), then right to (2,4) to win.

So, the actions would be:

right, right, left, up, up, up, up, right.

But I need to output just one action at a time. Since the user is asking for the next action, I should choose the first step, which is moving right.

Wait, but in the previous conversation, the user was moving left, up, etc. Maybe I need to adjust based on the current state.

Alternatively, perhaps the door is blocking the path, and I need to get the key first.

In any case, the first step is to move right to get the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right.

I notice there are several walls and ""stop"" rules, which likely block movement. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so that's a barrier I need to avoid or move past.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe that's part of a mechanism I can use, but I'm not sure yet.

The key is 1 step to the left, and the rule for the key is 1 step to the right. So, if I move the key next to the rule, maybe I can change its property. But since I'm Baba, I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. I need to check if the key is movable.

The door is 2 steps up, so I probably need the key to open it. Once I have the key, I can move towards the door. But first, I need to get the key. It's 1 step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. The win is up and to the right, the key is to the left, and the door is up. So, I need to go left to get the key, then up to the door, and then right towards the win.

But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to navigate around them. Maybe I can move the key to the right to activate its rule, making it a ""key is something"" which might help in opening the door.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key to change its property. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the key, it might become ""key is something,"" which could unlock the door.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe moving Baba there could change the rules, but I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move left to get the key. Then, I can move the key to the right to activate its rule. Once the key is active, I can use it to open the door. After opening the door, I can move towards the win condition.

But I have to be careful with the walls and the ""stop"" rule. I don't want to get stuck or blocked. Let me check the path again. Moving left to get the key, then right to position it, then up to the door, and then right towards the win.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up, so after getting the key, I need to move up to reach it. Once I open the door, I can proceed to the win.

I think the best first move is to go left to pick up the key. That way, I can then use it to open the door and reach the win.

The walls are at 3 steps left and 4 up, 3 left and 3 up, 3 left and 2 up, 3 left and 1 up, 3 left, 3 left and 1 down, and 3 left and 2 down. So, there's a vertical line of walls on the left side, which might block my path if I go that way.

The door is at 1 right and 2 up, which is to the right and up a bit. The key is 2 right, so I need to move right twice to get it. Once I have the key, I can go back to the door and open it, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

But I also see a ""rule `stop`"" at 5 left and 4 up. That might be a rule that stops me, so I need to avoid it or change it. However, since I'm moving right, maybe I don't need to worry about it immediately.

Another thing is the ""rule `ball`"" at 1 left and 2 up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's a distraction or part of another rule I can use.

So, my plan is to move right twice to get the key, then back to the door to open it. After that, I can proceed towards the win condition. Let me check if there are any walls blocking my path when I move right. The walls are mostly on the left, so moving right should be clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules by moving the ""is"" or ""you"" blocks to create new rules, but that might complicate things. For now, I'll stick to the straightforward approach of getting the key and opening the door.

So, the first step is to move right twice. Let me do that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win block is somewhere in that direction. There's also a door 2 steps up, which might be a barrier I need to open. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. That probably means the key can be used to open the door.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which are likely immovable. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so that's a block I can't move through. The walls are scattered around, creating a sort of maze.

To get to the win block, I need to navigate around the walls. The door is in the way, so I need to get the key first. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is 2 steps up.

Wait, but how do I use the key? In Baba Is You, sometimes you need to create a rule that allows you to use items. The ""rule `key`"" is 1 step to the right, so maybe I need to move the key next to it to create a new rule, like ""key is use"" or something similar. That would let me use the key to open the door.

Alternatively, maybe just moving to the key and then to the door is enough. I'm not entirely sure, but I think moving left to get the key is the first step. Once I have the key, I can move up to the door and use it to open it, then proceed to the win block.

So, the plan is: move left to get the key, then up to the door, use the key to open the door, and then move up to the win block. But I need to make sure I can actually move in those directions without hitting any walls or stop blocks.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is where the win block is. So, I need to make sure I can navigate around that. Maybe moving left first to get the key, then up, then right or left as needed to avoid walls.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so moving left once should get me the key. Then, moving up twice should take me to the door. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are at various positions, but I think moving left and then up should be clear.

Once I have the key, I can use it on the door. Then, I can move up to the win block. Alternatively, if the door is blocking the way to the win block, opening it would clear the path.

I think the immediate next step is to move left to pick up the key. That way, I can proceed to open the door and reach the win block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out the path and any obstacles.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to pick up the key first to unlock the door and reach the win condition.

But wait, there are walls and other rules on the map. The walls are in various positions, so I need to navigate around them. The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might be an immovable object. I should avoid that.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet. Maybe it's a distraction or part of another rule I can manipulate.

Since I'm currently at the starting position, I need to move towards the key. The key is 2 steps to the right, so I should move right twice. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The walls are at 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so moving right shouldn't be blocked by them.

After picking up the key, I can then move towards the door, which is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Once I open the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" rules to change the game's behavior. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location, I might change what counts as winning. But that might complicate things, and I'm not sure if it's necessary right now.

I think the straightforward approach is to move right to get the key, then use it to open the door and reach the win condition. So, my next move should be to move right to start collecting the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a door 2 steps up, which might be a barrier I need to open. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can use the key to open the door.

I also notice several walls and ""stop"" rules, which probably block movement. The walls are positioned in a way that might restrict my path, so I need to find a way around them or change the rules to make them passable.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something like that, I might be able to move the walls.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps left and 4 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change what stops me. But I'm not sure yet.

I think the key is to get the key first. It's 1 step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is 2 steps up. But wait, the door is at 2 steps up, and the key is 1 step left. So, I need to move left to get the key, then up to the door.

But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions. There are walls at 4 steps left and 4 up, 4 left and 3 up, etc. So, moving left might be blocked by walls. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" that would help. But I need to see if there's an ""is"" block I can move near a ""wall"" block.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up, another at 7 steps left and 3 up, and others. Maybe I can move one of these ""is"" blocks next to a ""wall"" block to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up is just ""is"" without a subject. If I move a ""wall"" block next to it, I can create ""wall is something."" But I need to see what's available.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make the key do something else, but I'm not sure.

Let me try to plan my moves. First, I need to get the key. It's 1 step to the left, but there's a wall there. So, I can't move left directly. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up, and the key is 1 step left. If I move up twice, I can reach the door, but it's locked. So, I need the key first.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. Let me look for a ""wall"" rule that I can modify. There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 8 steps left and 3 up. If I can move an ""is"" block next to it, I can change the wall's properties.

For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to move it next to the ""wall"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is wall"" to turn myself into a wall, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""stop is you,"" then the stop blocks won't stop me. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Let me try to move the ""is"" block at 4 steps up next to the ""stop"" rule. If I can create ""stop is you,"" then the stop blocks won't affect me, allowing me to move through them.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to move it next to the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps left and 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up. So, I need to move left 2 steps to get the ""is"" block next to the ""stop"" block.

Wait, but moving left might be blocked by walls. Let me check the walls' positions again. There's a wall at 4 steps left and 4 up, which is directly in my path if I move left. So, I can't move left unless I change the rules.

This is a bit tricky. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me see if there's another way to get the key without moving left.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make the key do something else, like ""key is win,"" so that picking up the key wins the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""rule `key`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move it next to the key object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to move it next to the key object. The key is 1 step to the left, so if I can move the ""key"" rule to the left, I can create ""key is win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 up. If I can move it next to the key, I can create ""key is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule might be difficult because it's far up. Let me think.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But I'm not sure if that works.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would be me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is pass,"" then I can walk through the key, but I need to pick it up.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block at 4 steps up next to the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is you,"" which would allow me to move through stop blocks.

But to do that, I need to move left 2 steps from the ""is"" block at 4 up to reach the ""stop"" block at 6 left and 4 up. But there's a wall in the way. So, I can't move left unless I change the rules.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall. Let me see: if I move up, I can go to 4 up, where the ""is"" block is. Then, from there, I can move left to reach the ""stop"" block.

But moving up from my current position (which I think is the origin) would take me to 4 up. Then, moving left 2 steps would take me to 6 left and 4 up, where the ""stop"" block is. But there's a wall at 4 left and 4 up, so moving left from 4 up would hit the wall.

So, I can't move left because of the wall. Maybe I need to change the wall's properties first.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to a ""wall"" block.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 8 left and 3 up. If I can move an ""is"" block next to it, I can create ""wall is pass.""

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to move it from 4 up to 8 left and 3 up. That's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" block next to an ""is"" block. The ""wall"" block is at 8 left and 3 up, and there's an ""is"" block at 7 left and 3 up. So, if I can move the ""wall"" block next to the ""is"" block, I can create ""wall is something.""

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 7 left and 3 up, and the ""wall"" block is at 8 left and 3 up. So, they are adjacent. That means the rule is ""wall is [something],"" but what's the something? It must be the next block. Let me check.

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 7 left and 3 up, and the ""wall"" block is at 8 left and 3 up. So, the rule is ""wall is [next block]."" But what's the next block? It would be whatever is to the right of the ""is"" block. Wait, no, the rule is formed by [subject] IS [property], so it's ""wall is [property]."" The property is whatever is next to the ""is"" block on the right.

Wait, no, the rule is formed by the subject, then ""is,"" then the property. So, if ""wall"" is at 8 left and 3 up, and ""is"" is at 7 left and 3 up, then the rule is ""wall is [something]."" The something would be whatever is to the right of the ""is"" block. But in this case, the ""is"" block is at 7 left and 3 up, and the ""wall"" block is at 8 left and 3 up. So, the rule is ""wall is [nothing],"" because there's nothing to the right of the ""is"" block.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" block to create a proper rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block at 4 up next to the ""wall"" block at 4 left and 4 up. So, if I can move the ""is"" block at 4 up to 4 left and 4 up, then the rule would be ""wall is [something].""

But moving the ""is"" block left would require moving through walls, which I can't do unless I change the rules.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can reach the key without moving left.

The key is 1 step to the left, but there's a wall there. So, I can't move left. Maybe I can move up first, then left.

Wait, if I move up 4 steps, I can reach the ""is"" block at 4 up. Then, from there, I can move left to reach the ""stop"" block. But moving left from 4 up would hit the wall at 4 left and 4 up.

So, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to change the wall's properties first.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to create a rule where ""wall is pass."" So, I need to move an ""is"" block next to a ""wall"" block and have ""pass"" as the property.

But I don't see a ""pass"" block on the map. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is pass,"" so I can pass through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" block either.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""key"" to open the door, but I can't reach the key because of the wall. So, I need to find a way to get around the wall.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win the level without moving. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to myself, I can create ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, so that the door becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the door.

But I'm not sure how to do that.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to try moving the ""is"" block at 4 up next to the ""stop"" block to make ""stop is you,"" which would allow me to move through stop blocks. But I can't move left because of the wall.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to 4 up, then move left to reach the ""stop"" block. But the wall is in the way. So, I need to change the wall's properties first.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different strategy. Let me try to move the ""key"" rule next to the key to make ""key is win."" Then, picking up the key would win the level.

The ""key"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. The key is 1 step to the left. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule to the left, I can create ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to move it next to the key. So, I need to move left to reach the key, but I can't because of the wall.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall. If I move up 4 steps, I can reach the ""is"" block at 4 up. Then, from there, I can move left to reach the ""stop"" block. But again, the wall is in the way.

I'm going in circles here. Maybe I need to accept that I can't move left and try to find another way to win.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up. If I can reach the door, maybe it's the win condition. But it's locked, and I need the key. So, I need the key to open the door.

But I can't get the key because of the wall. So, I need to find a way to get around the wall.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is door,"" then I can turn into the door and win. But I don't see a ""door"" rule that I can modify.

Wait, there's a ""rule `door`"" at 1 step to the right and 2 up. If I can move an ""is"" block next to it, I can create a new rule. For example, ""door is win"" would make the door the win condition.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""is"" block there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 up. If I can move it down to 2 up, next to the door, I can create ""door is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule would require moving it down, which might be possible if I can change the rules.

This is really tricky. I think I need to try moving the ""is"" block at 4 up next to the ""stop"" block to make ""stop is you,"" allowing me to move through stop blocks. Then, I can move left to get the key.

So, my plan is:

1. Move up 4 steps to reach the ""is"" block at 4 up.
2. Move left 2 steps to reach the ""stop"" block at 6 left and 4 up, creating the rule ""stop is you.""
3. Now, I can move through stop blocks.
4. Move left 1 step to get the key.
5. Move up to the door and use the key to open it, which should win the level.

But wait, moving left from 4 up is blocked by a wall at 4 left and 4 up. So, I can't move left unless I change the wall's properties.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the wall's properties first. Let me try to create ""wall is pass.""

To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to a ""wall"" block and have ""pass"" as the property. But I don't see a ""pass"" block. Maybe I can use another rule.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push the walls aside. But I don't see a ""push"" block either.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is wall,"" which would let me become a wall, but that doesn't help.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""key"" rule next to the key to make ""key is win.""

So, I need to move the ""key"" rule from 1 right and 1 down to the key's position at 1 left. That would require moving left 2 steps and up 2 steps, but I can't move left because of the wall.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to 4 up, then move left to reach the ""stop"" block, then move down to get the key. But I can't move left because of the wall.

I think I need to accept that I can't move left and try to find another way to win. Maybe the win condition is reachable without the key.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 up. If I can reach that, I can win. So, maybe I can move right and up to reach it.

But moving right from my current position would take me to 1 right, 4 up, which is the ""win"" rule. So, if I can move right and up, I can reach the win condition.

Wait, but I'm at the origin. If I move right, I can go to 1 right, then up 4 steps to reach the ""win"" rule. But is that possible?

Let me check the walls. There's a wall at 4 left and 4 up, but moving right wouldn't hit that wall. So, maybe I can move right and up to reach the ""win"" rule.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right 1 step.
2. Move up 4 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.
3. This should make me win the level.

But wait, the ""win"" rule is ""win is [","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a door, a key, and the Baba. The key is one step to the left, and there's a rule ""key"" one step to the right. The door is two steps up. There's also a ""ball"" rule two steps to the left and two steps up. 

Hmm, I think I need to get the key to open the door. But how? The key is to the left, but I'm not sure if I can move there because of the walls. Let me visualize the map. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but maybe I can move around them.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is one step to the right. If I can move the key or the rule, maybe I can change the rules to make the key accessible. Or perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. 

I also notice the ""stop"" rule is six steps to the left and four steps up. Maybe that's preventing me from moving in certain directions. If I can break that rule or move it somewhere else, I might have more freedom.

Another thought: the ""ball"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps up. If I can make Baba into a ball, maybe I can roll through the walls or something. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get to the key. The key is one step to the left, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the wall or change the rules so that walls don't block me. Alternatively, I can try to move around the walls.

Wait, the door is two steps up. If I can get to the door, maybe it leads somewhere else, but I need the key to open it. So the key is essential. 

I think the best approach is to try to move towards the key. Let me see the possible moves. From my current position, I can move left, right, up, or down. Moving left might take me towards the key, but there's a wall. Maybe I can move up first to get around the wall.

Alternatively, I can try to manipulate the rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule or the ""wall"" rules, I might be able to create a path. For example, if I can make the walls stop being walls, I can pass through them.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is eight steps to the left and three steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what a wall is. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another idea: the ""is"" rule is four steps up. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can define a new property.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try moving towards the key and see if I can find a way around the walls. Let me try moving left first. If that's blocked, I'll try moving up or down.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the wall. How? If I can make the wall into something else, like a pushable block, I can move it aside. But I don't see a rule that allows me to do that yet.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push them. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I can make Baba into a ball, I can roll through the walls. But I need to figure out how to do that. I think I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to Baba and the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is ball.""

But how do I move the ""ball"" rule? It's two steps to the left and two steps up. I need to get there, but the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move up first to get around.

Wait, the door is two steps up. If I move up, I might reach the door, but I need the key. So I'm stuck again.

I think I need to focus on getting the key first. Let me try moving left. If that's blocked, I'll try moving up or down to find another path.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I might be able to move more freely. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

This is tricky. I think I'll try moving left towards the key and see what happens. If it's blocked, I'll adjust my strategy.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of rules and walls. There's a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That must be the win condition. So, I need to get Baba to that position.

But wait, there are walls in the way. Walls are usually immovable, but maybe I can change that by manipulating the rules. Let me see if there's a way to make walls passable or turn them into something else.

I notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" which is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what ""stop"" does. Also, there's a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right, which might be useful for opening a door. There's a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, so maybe I need the key to get through.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is 1 step to the left. So, if I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door. But wait, do I need to change any rules to make the key work? The ""rule `key`"" is 2 steps to the right, so maybe I can move that rule to make the key do something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a key by rearranging the rules. If I can create a rule like ""baba is key,"" then Baba would become a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the separate key object.

Let me think about how to do that. I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""key"" rule next to Baba. The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, and the ""rule `key`"" is 2 steps to the right. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to Baba and the ""key"" rule next to that, I can form ""baba is key.""

But moving rules requires that they are not stopped by walls or other immovable objects. I need to check if the path is clear. The walls are at various positions, but maybe I can move around them.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule to make ""stop"" do something else, like become passable, that might help. For example, if I can make ""stop is pass,"" then walls with ""stop"" would become passable.

But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving it away, so that walls are no longer stopped.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""stop"" to make ""stop is something else,"" but I'm not sure.

Let me try to plan step by step:

1. Move left to pick up the key. That would be the ""left"" action.

2. Once I have the key, I can move towards the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, so I need to navigate there.

3. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule and ""key"" rule to create ""baba is key,"" which would allow me to open the door without needing the separate key.

4. Alternatively, if I can't do that, I might need to find another way to bypass the walls, perhaps by changing the rules to make walls passable.

Wait, another idea: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I might not need to go all the way to the original win condition. But the ""win"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is the same as the win object, so that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new win condition by rearranging rules. For example, making ""door is win"" would mean that the door becomes the win condition, so I just need to reach the door.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, so I need to see if I can move the rules there.

This seems complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to pick up the key and then use it to open the door, then proceed to the win condition.

So, first, I'll move left to get the key. That's the ""left"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

First, I should note the positions of other objects. There are walls, a door, a key, and some other rules. The door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and the key is 1 step to the right. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to reach the win condition.

But wait, the door is two steps up and two steps to the right. The key is just one step to the right. So, I might need to move right to get the key, then use it to open the door. But I also need to consider the walls and other rules.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `stop`"" which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. I don't know what that does yet, but maybe it's an obstacle. There's also a ""rule `wall`"" which is 6 steps to the left and 3 steps up. That might mean that walls are stoppable or something.

I see a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps up. Not sure how that affects things. There's also a ""rule `key`"" 3 steps to the right. So, maybe the key has some special property.

I think the key is important because it's near the door. If I can get the key, I can open the door. So, my plan is to move right to get the key, then use it to go through the door to reach the win condition.

But wait, the key is 1 step to the right, and the door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, I need to move right once to get the key, then maybe up twice to reach the door. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking my path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls to the left and some in the middle. I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall. The walls are mostly on the left side, so moving right might be clear.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" which are positioned to the left and down. Maybe those can be used to change the rules, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I might not need to change that right now.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get the key. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door and proceed towards the win condition. So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The ""WIN"" rule is located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems like my target. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various points, so I need to navigate around them. The ""stop"" rule is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might indicate a barrier or an immovable object. I should avoid moving into that area.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet, but maybe it can be used to change the rules or create a path. The ""key"" rule is 2 steps to the right, so I should move towards that first.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move right twice to get the key. Once I have the key, I can move up to reach the door. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition, which is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up.

I should also be cautious of any other rules that might affect my movement. For example, if there's a ""wall"" rule nearby, it could block my path. I need to make sure I don't step into any areas that are defined as walls or stop points.

So, my first move should be to the right to pick up the key. That way, I can open the door and continue towards the win condition without being blocked.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""stop,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""ball,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" and ""baba"" rules. I also notice a key and a door, which might be part of the puzzle.

First, I need to figure out where everything is located. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps left and 4 up. There's a wall at 4 left and 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up, which is a bit confusing because it's just a position without a specific direction. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 4 up. So, the win condition is somewhere to the right and up.

There are multiple ""wall"" rules, which probably define the walls in the level. The ""ball"" rule is 2 steps left and 2 up, and the ""door"" is 2 steps up. The key is 1 step left, and the ""key"" rule is 1 step right. There's also a ""baba"" rule 9 steps left and 2 down, which might be another Baba or a rule that can be manipulated.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the properties of objects. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects or rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine it with other rules to create new properties.

Looking at the door and key, I might need to get the key to open the door. The key is 1 step left, so I can move left to pick it up. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking my path. The walls are at various positions, so I have to navigate around them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 6 left and 4 up. If I can move that, maybe I can stop something or create a new rule. Also, the ""win"" rule is 1 right and 4 up, so if I can reach that, I might win. But I need to see if there's a path.

I'm a bit confused about the ""is"" rule at 4 up. Maybe it's part of another rule that I can form. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another word, I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" could change the win condition.

Let me plan my steps. I need to move towards the key first. Since the key is 1 step left, I'll move left. But I have to check if there's a wall in the way. The walls are at 4 left and 4 up, so moving left from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point) might be possible.

After picking up the key, I can go to the door, which is 2 steps up. But I need to make sure the door isn't blocked. If the door is a wall, maybe I can change its property using a rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the door openable without the key. For example, if I can make the door ""is open"" or something like that.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 2 left and 2 up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something. But I'm not sure how yet.

I think the best first step is to move left to get the key. That way, I can open the door if needed. So, I'll choose the ""left"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is probably that object. I need to get Baba to that position.

But wait, there are walls and other rules in the way. Let me map out the positions. The Baba is at the origin, I think. The win rule is at (2,4). To get there, I might need to move right twice and up four times, but I have to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls at different positions. For example, a wall is at (3,4), which is one step to the right of the win rule. So, if I move right twice, I'd be at (2,4), which is the win rule. But wait, is there a wall blocking me? Let me see: the wall is at (3,4), so that's to the right of the win rule. So, moving right twice from (0,0) would take me to (2,0), but I need to go up as well.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinates. Let me clarify: each ""step"" is a unit in a direction. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate. So, starting at (0,0), moving right twice would take me to (2,0), and moving up four times would take me to (0,4). But I need to combine these movements.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to avoid walls. Let me see the walls' positions. There's a wall at (3,4), which is the same y-level as the win rule. So, if I move up to y=4, I can then move right to x=2. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path.

Wait, there's a wall at (3,4), but I'm moving to (2,4), so that should be okay. Let me plan the path: move up four times to (0,4), then right twice to (2,4). But I need to check if there are any walls in between. Are there walls at (0,4)? No, the walls are at (3,4), (3,3), etc. So, moving up to (0,4) is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first. Let's see: moving right once to (1,0), then up four times to (1,4). But is there a wall at (1,4)? No, the walls are at (3,4), so that's fine. Then, from (1,4), move right once to (2,4) to reach the win rule.

Wait, but the win rule is at (2,4), so that's correct. So, the path would be: right, right, up, up, up, up. Or up first, then right. Either way, I need to get to (2,4).

But wait, are there any other rules or objects that might affect this? Let me check the other rules. There's a ""rule `stop`"" at (5,4), which is far to the right. There's a ""rule `is`"" at (1,4), which is part of the win rule. So, moving to (2,4) should trigger the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules to change the win condition. But since the win rule is already present, perhaps I just need to reach it.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and the win rule is at (2,4). So, moving there should win the level. Let me try that.

So, the plan is: move right twice and up four times, or up four times and then right twice. Let me choose to move up first to avoid any potential walls on the right path.

So, the actions would be: up, up, up, up, right, right. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I'll start with moving up.

Wait, but the user is asking for a single action. So, I should choose the first step, which is up.

But wait, maybe I should move right first to get closer to the win rule. Let me think again.

If I move right first, I go to (1,0). Then, moving up four times would take me to (1,4), and then right to (2,4). That might be a better path because moving up from (1,0) to (1,4) might be clearer.

Alternatively, moving up first to (0,4), then right twice. Both paths seem possible. I'll choose to move right first.

So, the first action is right.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key. I see a ""key"" 1 step to the left, and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the key and use it to open the door.

But wait, I also notice a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be an obstacle. I need to make sure I don't get stopped by it. There are several walls around, so I have to navigate carefully.

I think the first step is to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left. But I need to check if there are any walls or other objects blocking my path. From the map, it seems like moving left is possible without immediate obstructions.

After picking up the key, I can then move up towards the door. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the path easier, but since I'm just starting, moving towards the key seems like the most straightforward approach.

So, the immediate action should be to move left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is probably that object. I need to get Baba to that position.

But wait, there are walls and other rules in the way. Let me map out the positions. The ""rule `win`"" is at (2 right, 4 up). The Baba is at the starting point, which I assume is (0,0). To get to (2 right, 4 up), I need to move right twice and up four times. But I have to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls at different positions. For example, a wall is at (3 left, 4 up), which is to the left of the win object. Another wall is at (3 left, 3 up), and so on. It seems like the walls are arranged in a way that might block my path, but I need to see if there's a clear path or if I can manipulate the rules to move through them.

I also notice there are other rules like ""rule `stop`"" and ""rule `wall`."" The ""rule `stop`"" is at (5 left, 4 up), which might be a rule that stops movement if I step on it. The ""rule `wall`"" is at (7 left, 3 up), which could define what a wall is. Maybe if I move these rules, I can change the properties of objects.

There's also a ""rule `key`"" at (2 right) and a ""key"" object at (1 left). Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock a door. The door is at (1 right, 2 up). So, perhaps I need to go through the door to reach the win condition.

Let me plan the steps. First, I need to move right to get the key. From my starting position, moving right once would take me to (1 right, 0). But I need to check if there's a wall there. The walls are at (3 left, 4 up), etc., so maybe the path to the key is clear.

Once I have the key, I can approach the door. The door is at (1 right, 2 up). So, I need to move up twice and right once. But again, I need to ensure there are no walls blocking that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" to redefine what a wall is, I might be able to walk through them. But that seems a bit complex for now.

Another thought: the ""rule `ball`"" is at (1 left, 2 up). Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure how that would help here.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is at (5 left, 4 up). If I can move that rule, maybe I can stop myself from moving into a wall or something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me focus on getting the key first. I need to move right twice to reach the key at (2 right). But looking at the walls, there's a wall at (3 left, 4 up), which is far to the left, so maybe the path to the key is clear. So, I'll move right twice to get the key.

After picking up the key, I can then approach the door. The door is at (1 right, 2 up). So, from my current position at (2 right), I need to move up twice and left once to reach the door. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at (3 left, 2 up), which is to the left of the door. So, if I move left from (2 right) to (1 right), that's clear. Then moving up twice should take me to the door at (1 right, 2 up). Once I have the key, I can open the door.

After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition at (2 right, 4 up). I need to move up two more steps from the door's position. Let me check if there are any walls in that path. The walls are at (3 left, 4 up), which is to the left, so the path to the win should be clear.

So, the plan is: move right twice to get the key, then move left once and up twice to open the door, and then up two more times to reach the win condition.

But wait, I need to make sure that moving the key and door doesn't require any rule changes. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move normally unless there are other rules affecting me.

I think this plan should work. Let me try moving right twice to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key. I see a ""key"" 1 step to the left, and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the key and use it to open the door.

But wait, I also notice a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be an obstacle. I need to make sure I don't get stopped by it. There are several walls around, so I have to navigate carefully.

I think the first step is to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left. But I need to check if there are any walls or other objects blocking my path. From the map, it seems like moving left is possible without immediate obstructions.

After picking up the key, I can then move up towards the door. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the path easier, but since I'm just starting, moving towards the key seems like the most straightforward approach.

So, the immediate action should be to move left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. So, I need to get Baba to that position.

But wait, there are walls and other rules in the way. Let me map out the positions. The ""rule `win`"" is at (2 right, 4 up). The Baba is at the starting point, which I assume is (0,0). To get to (2 right, 4 up), I need to move right twice and up four times. But I have to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls at different positions. For example, there's a wall at (3 left, 4 up), which is to the left of the win rule. Another wall is at (3 left, 3 up), and so on. It seems like the walls are arranged in a way that might block my path, but I need to see if there's a clear path or if I can manipulate the rules to move through them.

I also notice there are other rules like ""rule `stop`"" and ""rule `key`."" The ""rule `stop`"" is at (5 left, 4 up), which might be an obstacle if it's blocking movement. The ""rule `key`"" is at (2 right), which could be useful if I need to unlock something.

Wait, there's a door at (1 right, 2 up). Doors usually require a key to open. So, maybe I need to get the key first. The key is at (2 right), so I can move right twice to get it. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed further.

But how do I get the key? It's at (2 right), so I just need to move right twice. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right twice to get the key.
2. Use the key to open the door at (1 right, 2 up).
3. Proceed up to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving right twice doesn't take me into any walls. Let me check the walls again. The walls are mostly on the left side, so moving right might be clear. However, there's a wall at (3 left, 4 up), which is to the left of the win rule, so it shouldn't block my path to the right.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `stop`"" at (5 left, 4 up). If I'm moving right, I won't encounter this rule. But if I need to move left later, it might stop me. For now, I don't think it's an issue.

So, the plan is:

- Move right twice to get the key.
- Then, move up to reach the door.
- Open the door with the key.
- Continue moving up to the win condition.

But wait, the door is at (1 right, 2 up). So after getting the key at (2 right), I need to move left once to get to the door. Then, up twice to reach the door's position. Once the door is open, I can move up further to the win rule.

Let me outline the steps more clearly:

1. Move right twice: right, right. Now at (2 right, 0).
2. Move up twice: up, up. Now at (2 right, 2 up).
3. Move left once: left. Now at (1 right, 2 up), which is the door.
4. Since I have the key, the door opens, and I can move up.
5. Move up twice more: up, up. Now at (1 right, 4 up).
6. Move right once to reach the win condition at (2 right, 4 up).

Wait, but the win rule is at (2 right, 4 up). So after step 5, I'm at (1 right, 4 up). Then, moving right once would take me to (2 right, 4 up), which is the win condition.

But I need to make sure that each move is possible without hitting walls. Let me check each position:

- After moving right twice: (2 right, 0). Is there a wall here? Looking at the objects, I don't see a wall at (2 right, 0), so it's clear.
- Moving up twice: (2 right, 2 up). Is there a wall here? No, so it's clear.
- Moving left once: (1 right, 2 up). That's the door. With the key, I can pass.
- Moving up twice: (1 right, 4 up). Is there a wall here? No, so it's clear.
- Moving right once: (2 right, 4 up). That's the win condition.

So, the path seems clear. I just need to execute these moves in order.

Alternatively, maybe there's a faster way. Let me see if I can move up first and then right, but the walls might block that path. It's safer to go right first, get the key, and then proceed.

Another consideration: Are there any other rules that might affect my movement? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move normally. There's a ""rule `stop`"" but it's not in my path, so I shouldn't be stopped.

I think the plan is solid. Let's proceed with moving right twice to get the key, then up to the door, open it, and reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is somewhere up and to the right. There's also a ""door"" 2 steps up, which might be blocking the way. To open the door, I probably need a key. I see a ""key"" 1 step to the left, and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the key and use it to open the door.

But wait, there are walls all around. The walls are at various positions, some to the left and up, which might be blocking my path. I need to figure out how to move around them. Also, there's a ""rule `stop`"" which might be making some objects immovable. I should check if I can move the ""stop"" rule to change that.

I also notice a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure yet. The ""rule `baba`"" is 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down, which is far away, so probably not relevant right now.

To get to the win condition, I need to move up and to the right. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move some walls or the ""stop"" rule to create a path. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to get the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once. Then, I can move up to reach the door. But the door is 2 steps up, so I need to make sure there's a clear path. There are walls at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps up, which might block me. Maybe I can move those walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps up, so if I move left 4 times and up 2 times, I can reach them. But I'm not sure if I can move walls. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba, but walls might be immovable unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls movable. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can make the walls stop being stoppers.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should first try to get the key and see if I can open the door without moving the walls. Let me try moving left once to get the key.

After getting the key, I can move up towards the door. But the door is 2 steps up, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I can use the key to open the door, but I need to be adjacent to the door. The door is 2 steps up, so I need to move up twice. But the walls are blocking me. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""rule `win`"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule down, the win condition might be closer. But I'm not sure how to move rules yet.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by pushing them. So, if I can get next to the ""win"" rule, I can push it to a new location. But I need to be able to move there without being blocked by walls.

Let me try to move up as much as possible. I'm currently at the starting position. Moving up 4 steps would take me to the top, but there are walls there. Maybe I can move left or right to find a path.

Looking at the map, the walls are at 4 steps to the left and various up positions. So, moving left 4 times would take me to the wall. Maybe I can move left 3 times and up to avoid the walls.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps up, which is directly above me. Maybe I can move up to that position and see if I can manipulate the rules there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls out of the way.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me try to move up to the ""is"" rule and see if I can combine it with another rule.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps up, so I can move up 4 times to reach it. Once there, maybe I can push it to combine with another rule, like ""wall is push.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe I need to move the ""wall"" rule and the ""is"" rule together to create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being stoppers. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule to a different location, perhaps the walls will no longer stop me.

But I'm not sure how to move rules yet. Maybe I need to push them with Baba.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks by moving into them. So, if I can get next to the ""stop"" rule, I can push it to a new location.

But the ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is far away. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first and opening the door.

Let me try moving left once to get the key. Then, I can move up towards the door. But the door is 2 steps up, and there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can use the key to open the door once I'm adjacent to it.

Wait, the door is 2 steps up, so I need to move up twice. But the walls are at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps up, which might block my path. Maybe I can move around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls. If I can make the walls movable, I can push them out of the way. But I need to change the rules to do that.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for any other rules that can help me. There's a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can get the ball, maybe I can use it to push the walls. But I need to reach the ball first.

To get the ball, I need to move left 2 times and up 2 times. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the walls first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make the ball do something else. But I'm not sure.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location, I can reach it without dealing with the walls.

The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move it down, maybe I can reach it more easily. But I need to be able to push it, which requires being adjacent to it.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. If I move right once and up 4 times, I can reach the ""win"" rule. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can find a path around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls to create a path. But I need to change the rules to make the walls movable.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls movable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls.

But how do I do that? I need to combine the ""wall"" rule with the ""is"" rule and the ""push"" rule. Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that to combine with the ""wall"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""is"" rule's position to create a new rule.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move up as much as possible to see if I can find a way around the walls.

I move up 4 times, but I hit a wall. Maybe I can move left or right to find a gap. The walls are at 4 steps to the left and various up positions, so moving left 4 times would take me to the wall. Maybe I can move left 3 times and up to find a path.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps up, so moving up 4 times would take me there. Maybe I can use that rule to change something.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make something else. For example, if I can make ""baba is push,"" then I can push walls.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down, which is far away. Maybe that's not helpful right now.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being stoppers. The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule to a different location, perhaps the walls will no longer block me.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I need to push it with Baba.

Wait, I can move left 6 times and up 4 times to reach the ""stop"" rule. But that's a long way, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule by pushing it from a distance. But I don't think that's possible.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find another way to reach the win condition without dealing with the walls. Is there another path?

Looking at the map, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move right once and up 4 times, but the walls are blocking the way. Alternatively, maybe I can move up first and then right.

Wait, if I move up 4 times, I reach the ""is"" rule. Then, moving right once would take me to the ""win"" rule. But I'm not sure if that's possible because of the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location. If I can push it down, I can reach it more easily.

But I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule to push it. That requires moving right once and up 4 times, which is blocked by walls.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps I can use the key to open the door, which is 2 steps up. If I can get to the door, I can open it and reach the win condition.

The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once to get it. Then, I need to move up to reach the door. But the door is 2 steps up, and there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the walls to create a path.

Wait, if I can make the walls movable, I can push them out of the way. To do that, I need to change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""wall is push.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""is"" rule's position to create a new rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being stoppers. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, the walls might become movable.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to push it with Baba.

Wait, I can move left 6 times and up 4 times to reach the ""stop"" rule. But that's a long way, and I might get blocked by walls along the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule by pushing it from a distance, but I don't think that's possible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can push it down, I can reach it more easily.

But I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule to push it, which requires moving right once and up 4 times, which is blocked by walls.

This is really challenging. I think I need to find a way to make the walls movable so I can push them out of the way. Maybe I can use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls pushable.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is push.""

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps up, and the ""rule `wall`"" is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's location, I can create ""wall is push.""

But that requires moving the ""is"" rule 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which is a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""is"" rule's position. The ""wall"" rule is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up, so moving it to 4 steps up would require moving it up 1 step. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there are several walls and other rule blocks. The walls are immovable because they have the ""wall"" property, so I can't move through them. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a door 2 steps up. Maybe I need the key to open the door, but I'm not sure yet.

The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet. There's also a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up, but I don't see a ball object, so maybe that's not relevant right now.

I think the main challenge is to get to the win block. Since the win block is to the right and up, I need to move in that direction. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change my properties.

Wait, I see a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. The key is 1 step to the left, so I need to move left to pick it up. But moving left might take me away from the win block. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block closer to me by rearranging the rules. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me think about the possible actions.

I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Since the win block is up and to the right, moving up or right seems logical. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move around them.

Looking at the walls, they are placed at various positions. The closest wall is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That's directly above me, so I can't move up because of the wall. Maybe I can move right first to get around.

If I move right, I might get closer to the win block. Let me try moving right. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The wall is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so moving right might not be blocked immediately.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick up the key, which might help me open the door. The door is 2 steps up, so after getting the key, I can move up to open it.

But I'm not sure if the door is blocking the path to the win block. Let me visualize the map. The win block is 1 step right and 4 up. The door is 2 up. So maybe the door is on the path to the win block.

So the plan is: move left to get the key, then move up to open the door, and then proceed to the win block. But I need to make sure I can move in those directions without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to see if I can go around the walls. But the wall is directly above me, so moving up is blocked. So moving right first might be better.

Wait, if I move right, I can get closer to the win block. Let me try moving right. But I need to check if there are any walls to the right. The wall is 4 steps left and 4 up, so moving right might not be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first, but the wall is blocking that. So perhaps moving right is the way to go.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up, which might be necessary to open the door. So maybe I should prioritize getting the key first.

So, I think the best course of action is to move left to pick up the key, then use it to open the door, and then proceed to the win block. But I need to make sure I can move in those directions without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first, but the wall is blocking that. So moving left to get the key seems necessary.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so moving left once should get me the key. Then, I can move up to open the door. Let me try that.

So, the first action should be to move left to pick up the key. That way, I can proceed to open the door and reach the win block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. There's a door 2 steps up, which might require the key to open.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I see several walls around, so I need to navigate around them. The ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might be an obstacle I need to avoid or manipulate.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet, but maybe it can be used to change the rules somehow.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make walls passable or something. Alternatively, I can try to move the key to the door to unlock it.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to get the key. It's 1 step to the left, so I can move left. Then, I can move towards the door, which is 2 steps up. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

But wait, I also see that the ""rule `key`"" is 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move that rule to change what the key does. If I can make the key into something else, like a passable object, it might help me get through walls.

Alternatively, I could try to break the walls by changing their rules. If I can make walls into something else, like ""stop"" or ""you,"" that might allow me to pass through them.

I think the best approach is to first move towards the key. So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can see if I can use it to open the door or manipulate the rules further.

So, my first action should be to move left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there are walls and other rules. The walls are immovable because they have the ""wall"" property. There are also other rules like ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" and ""door."" The ""key"" and ""door"" might be part of a puzzle where I need to unlock something.

Wait, there's a ""rule `key`"" 3 steps to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open the door. The door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to move right to get the key, then use it to open the door to reach the win condition.

But first, I need to see if I can move towards the key. Let me check the path. From Baba's position, moving right would take me towards the key. Are there any walls blocking me? The walls are mostly to the left and down, so maybe the path to the right is clear.

I should also consider the ""stop"" rule. If I move into a ""stop"" rule, I might get stuck. The ""stop"" rule is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which is not directly in my path if I'm moving right. So, I think it's safe to move right.

So, my plan is to move right to pick up the key, then use it to open the door, and finally move up to reach the win condition. But first, I need to get to the key. Let me try moving right once to start.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is probably that object. I need to figure out how to get Baba to that position.

There are several walls and other rules scattered around. I notice there's a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right, and a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I can use the key to open a door? There's a ""door"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and reach the win object.

But wait, I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be an obstacle. I need to make sure I don't get stopped by that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else or break it.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure what that does, but maybe it's a distraction or part of the solution. I should keep it in mind.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to get the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left. But I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is where Baba is. So, moving left once should get me the key.

After getting the key, I can move right to get to the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, so I need to navigate there. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win object.

But I also need to be careful about the walls. There are walls in various positions, so I don't want to get stuck. I should check if moving in certain directions is blocked by walls.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I move left 5 times and up 4 times, I might hit that stop rule, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that or find a way to move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location so it doesn't block my path. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. But I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Since the rule is ""stop,"" maybe I can't move it directly. Hmm, that complicates things.

Maybe I can create a new rule by moving other text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules, I might be able to redefine what Baba is or change the win condition.

Looking at the other rules, there's a ""rule `baba`"" 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down, and a ""rule `you`"" 6 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move these, I might be able to change the active rules.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. Let me focus on getting the key first. Once I have the key, I can proceed to the door and then to the win object.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left to get the key.
2. Move right to the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed towards the win object, avoiding walls and the stop rule.

I need to make sure each move is valid and doesn't lead me into a wall or the stop rule. Let me try moving left first.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to figure out how to move Baba towards it.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door. The door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to pick up the key first to unlock the door and reach the win condition.

But wait, there are walls in the way. Walls are usually immovable, but maybe I can change the rules. I see several ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `wall`"" blocks. If I can move these, I might be able to change what counts as a wall or make them passable.

For example, if I can move a ""rule `is`"" block next to a ""rule `stop`"" block, I could create a new rule like ""stop is wall,"" making stop blocks act as walls. Or maybe I can rearrange other rules to make walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into something else. If I can create a rule like ""baba is key,"" then Baba would become a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the separate key object.

Let me think about the positions. The key is 1 step to the right, and the door is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, if I can move right once to get the key, then I can go up twice and right once more to reach the door. But are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls, there are several walls to the left and up. The walls are at various positions, but I need to see if the path to the key and door is clear. If the walls are in the way, I might need to break or move them, but since walls are usually immovable, I might need to change the rules to make them passable.

Another idea: if I can make the walls into something else, like ""wall is nothing,"" then they would disappear, clearing the path. To do that, I need to move a ""rule `is`"" block next to a ""rule `wall`"" block and a ""rule `nothing`"" block, but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving existing blocks. For example, if I can move the ""rule `key`"" block next to the ""rule `is`"" block, I could create ""key is you,"" making the key controllable. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I can make the door into something else, like ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Let me try to plan step by step. First, I need to get to the key. To do that, I need to move right once. But are there any walls blocking that path? The walls are at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up, so maybe the immediate right is clear. Let me try moving right to pick up the key.

After getting the key, I can then approach the door. The door is 2 steps up and 2 steps to the right. So from my current position, I would need to move up twice and right twice. But I need to check if the path is clear. If there are walls in the way, I might need to change the rules to move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a passable object. If I can create a rule like ""door is nothing,"" then the door would disappear, allowing me to pass through. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""rule `door`"" block and a ""rule `nothing`"" block, but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create it by rearranging other rules.

Wait, I see a ""rule `ball`"" block. Maybe I can use that. If I can make ""ball is nothing,"" then the ball would disappear, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, I can make ""door is ball,"" but I'm not sure.

Another approach: since I have the key, maybe I can use it to open the door without changing any rules. But in Baba Is You, usually, you need to have the key to open the door, so maybe just moving onto the door with the key would work.

So, the plan is: move right to get the key, then move up twice and right twice to reach the door. Then, with the key, the door should open, allowing me to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at various positions, but the key is 1 step to the right, so I can move there. Then, moving up and right should be possible if there are no walls blocking that path.

Alternatively, if the path is blocked, I might need to change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, making ""wall is nothing"" would remove the walls, but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create it by rearranging other rules.

Wait, I see a ""rule `stop`"" block. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop blocks would disappear. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is wall,"" then I can walk through walls, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, making ""wall is pass"" could work, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try moving right to get the key first. If that's blocked, then I'll think about changing the rules.

So, the first action should be to move right to pick up the key.

Then, there's a ""rule `is`"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, and the ""win"" rule 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, the path to the win might be blocked by walls or other rules.

I also notice a ""rule `key`"" 2 steps to the right. Maybe I need a key to open a door? There's a door 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps I need to get the key first to unlock the door and reach the win.

But how do I get the key? The key is 1 step to the right. So, if I move right once, I can pick up the key. But wait, is there a wall blocking me? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, but that's above me. The walls closer to me are at 3 steps to the left and 3, 2, 1 steps up, and at the same level. So, maybe I can move right without being blocked.

Once I have the key, I can open the door. The door is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So, after getting the key, I can move up twice and right once to open the door. Then, I can proceed towards the win.

But wait, there are other rules on the map. For example, ""rule `ball`"" is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. I'm not sure if that affects me. Also, there's a ""rule `stop`"" 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which might be a rule that stops movement if I step on it, but I'm not near it right now.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first thought is to identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is one step to the right and four steps up from my current position.

Next, I need to figure out how to get there. The path might be blocked by walls, so I should check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up, but I'm not sure exactly how they're arranged. I might need to move around them or break through them if possible.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object one step to the left and a ""rule `key`"" one step to the right. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something, like a door. The door is two steps up, so if I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and reach the win condition.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `stop`"" which is six steps to the left and four steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet, but it might be an obstacle or something I can manipulate.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up objects. I should try to move towards the key first. If I can get the key, I can then go to the door and open it. Once the door is open, I can proceed towards the win condition.

Let me plan my steps. I need to move left to reach the key. From my current position, moving left once should get me to the key. Then, I can move up towards the door. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. If there are walls, I might need to break them by manipulating the rules, but that could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls. I should check the positions of the walls relative to my path. The walls are at various steps to the left and up, but without a visual, it's a bit tricky. I'll assume that moving left towards the key is the right approach.

So, my first action should be to move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door, which is two steps up. After opening the door, I can move towards the win condition, which is one step to the right and four steps up.

I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or get stuck. If I encounter a wall, I might need to find a way around it or change the rules to make the wall passable. But for now, I'll proceed with moving left to get the key.

Let me confirm the positions again. The key is one step to the left, and the rule for the key is one step to the right. That might mean that the key is positioned such that I can pick it up by moving left. Once I have the key, I can interact with the door.

In summary, my plan is:
1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Move up through the door.
4. Proceed towards the win condition.

I think moving left is the first step. Let's try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rules and walls. The key objects are the ""rule"" blocks, which define the game's rules. My first thought is to identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is two steps to the right and four steps up from my current position.

Next, I need to figure out how to get there. The path might be blocked by walls, so I should check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up, but I'm not sure exactly how they're arranged. I might need to move around them or break through them if possible.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object two steps to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door or change a rule. The door is one step to the right and two steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

Another important rule is ""rule `stop` 5 step to the left and 4 step up."" This probably means that if I move in a certain way, I'll be stopped, so I need to avoid triggering that rule unless it's part of the solution.

I should also consider the other rules like ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `is`"" because they define how walls and other objects behave. If I can manipulate these rules, I might be able to change the environment to make the path clearer.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I move a ""stop"" rule block, I might be able to prevent myself from being stopped in a critical area. Alternatively, moving a ""wall"" rule could make walls passable or vice versa.

Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and the win is two steps to the right and four up. The key is two steps to the right, which is in the direction of the win. The door is one step to the right and two up, so it's on the path towards the win. If the door is locked, I'll need the key to open it.

I think the strategy should be to move towards the key first, then use it to open the door, and proceed to the win. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. If there are walls, I might need to break them by changing the rules.

Wait, the walls are positioned at various steps to the left and up. Since I'm moving to the right, maybe the walls aren't directly in my path. But I should check if moving right is possible without hitting any walls.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" and a ""rule `key`."" Maybe manipulating these can help. If I can make the ball do something, like push a wall, that could clear the path. Alternatively, changing the key's rule might make it easier to obtain.

Another consideration is the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" blocks. These define what Baba is. If I move these, I might change my own properties, which could be useful or dangerous.

I think the immediate next step is to move towards the key. So, I'll try moving right twice to reach the key. If that's blocked by a wall, I'll need to find a way around or change the rules to make the wall passable.

Alternatively, if moving right is blocked, I might need to move up first to bypass the walls. But without seeing the exact layout, it's a bit tricky. I'll proceed with moving right towards the key and see if that works.

If I can't reach the key directly, I might need to adjust the rules. For example, moving a ""stop"" rule away from my path or making a wall passable by changing its rule.

In summary, my plan is to move towards the key, then use it to open the door, and proceed to the win condition. I'll start by moving right to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is probably that object. I need to get Baba to that position.

Now, I need to figure out how to move Baba there. The map has several walls and other rules. Let me see the layout:

- There's a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps left and 4 up. That might be a wall or an obstacle.
- Walls are placed at various positions, some near the top and others lower down.
- There's a ""rule `wall`"" 8 steps left and 3 up, which probably defines walls as stoppers.
- There's a ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps left and 2 up, but I'm not sure how that affects things.
- A door is 2 steps up, which might require a key to open.
- There's a key 1 step left and a ""rule `key`"" 1 step right, which might mean the key can be used to open the door.

Wait, if there's a door, I might need to get the key to open it. The key is 1 step left, and the rule for the key is 1 step right. Maybe I can move the key's rule to make it a passable object or something else.

But first, I need to see if I can move Baba towards the win condition. Let me check the path. From Baba's starting position, moving right and up might be blocked by walls. The walls are at 4 steps left and various up positions, so they might form a barrier.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange some of these to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I could move the walls.

But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can only move Baba. I need to see if there's a way to get around the walls. Maybe the door can be opened with the key, allowing me to bypass the walls.

So, the plan is:

1. Move towards the key. The key is 1 step left, so I need to move left once.
2. Once I have the key, I can approach the door, which is 2 steps up.
3. Open the door to access the area beyond the walls.
4. Then, move towards the win condition, which is 1 step right and 4 steps up.

But wait, I need to make sure that moving left is possible. Are there any walls blocking that path? The walls are at 4 steps left and various up positions, so if I'm starting near the center, moving left once should be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls. Let me visualize the map:

- The win condition is 1 right and 4 up, so it's in the upper right.
- The key is 1 left, so it's to the left of Baba.
- The door is 2 up, so it's above Baba.

If I move up twice, I can reach the door. But is the door blocked by walls? The walls are at 4 left and various up positions, so maybe the path up is clear.

Wait, the walls are at 4 left and 4 up, which is the same as the stop rule. So, the upper left area is blocked, but the center might be clear.

I think the best approach is to move up to reach the door, then use the key to open it, and proceed to the win condition.

But I need to get the key first. So, I should move left once to get the key, then up to the door.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving towards the walls. Let me check the walls' positions again. The walls are at 4 left and 4 up, 4 left and 3 up, etc. So, moving left once from the starting position might not hit a wall immediately.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me try moving up once.

After moving up, I can check if the path is clear. If it is, I can continue moving up to reach the door. Once at the door, I can use the key to open it, which would require having the key.

But to get the key, I need to move left. So, perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move left once to get the key.
2. Move up twice to reach the door.
3. Open the door.
4. Move right and up to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving left once doesn't lead to a wall. Let me see: the walls are at 4 left and various up positions, so if I'm starting near the center, moving left once should be okay.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid any potential walls on the left path.

Wait, the key is 1 step left, so moving left once should get me to the key. Then, from there, I can move up to the door.

So, the first move should be left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. So, I need to get Baba to that position.

But wait, there are walls and other rules in the way. Let me map out the positions. The ""rule `win`"" is at (2 right, 4 up). The Baba is at the starting point, which I assume is (0,0). To get to (2 right, 4 up), I need to move right twice and up four times. But I have to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls at different positions. For example, a wall is at 3 steps left and 4 steps up. That's to the left of the win condition, so maybe not directly in my way. Another wall is at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, which is also to the left. So, perhaps the path to the right is clear.

But I also see a ""rule `stop`"" at 5 steps left and 4 steps up. That might be a rule that stops movement, but since I'm moving right, maybe it's not affecting me. I need to be careful about any rules that could prevent me from moving towards the win.

There's a ""rule `key`"" at 2 steps right, which might be useful if there's a locked door. I see a ""door"" at 1 step right and 2 steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door. But since the door is at (1 right, 2 up), and the key is at (2 right), I might need to move right first to get the key, then go back to the door.

Wait, but the key is at 2 steps right, and the door is at 1 step right and 2 up. So, if I move right twice to get the key, then I can go up to the door. But I need to make sure that the door is blocking my path to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the door passable without the key. For example, if I can change the rule so that the door isn't a stop, then I can pass through it without needing the key.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `wall`"" at 7 steps left and 3 up, and ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I can move these rules to create a new rule that changes the door's properties.

But since I'm Baba, I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, I need to see if I can move the ""rule `is`"" or ""rule `wall`"" to create a new rule like ""door IS NOT STOP"" or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `key`"" to combine it with the door. If I can make ""key IS door,"" then perhaps the key can open the door.

But I'm not sure. Let me think step by step.

1. My goal is to reach the ""WIN"" rule at (2 right, 4 up).
2. The path to the right seems clear, but there's a door at (1 right, 2 up).
3. To open the door, I might need the key at (2 right).
4. So, I need to get the key first, then go back to the door.

But moving right twice to get the key, then back left once to the door, then up twice to the win. That seems possible, but I need to check if the door is a stop.

If the door is a stop, I can't pass without the key. So, I need to get the key first.

So, the plan is:

- Move right twice to get the key.
- Then move left once to get back to the door.
- Then move up twice to reach the win.

But wait, after getting the key, do I need to do anything else? Or does having the key automatically allow me to pass the door?

In Baba Is You, usually, you need to have the key to pass the door. So, once I have the key, I can pass through the door.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right to (1 right, 0 up) - first step right.
2. Move right again to (2 right, 0 up) - get the key.
3. Move left to (1 right, 0 up) - back to the position before the door.
4. Move up to (1 right, 1 up).
5. Move up again to (1 right, 2 up) - now at the door.
6. Since I have the key, I can pass through the door.
7. Then, move up twice more to reach (1 right, 4 up), but the win is at (2 right, 4 up). So, I need to move right once more after passing the door.

Wait, that might not be the most efficient. Maybe after getting the key, I can move up to the door, pass through, then move right to the win.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move up first to avoid the door, but I don't think that's possible because the door is in the way.

Another thought: Maybe I can change the rules to make the door passable without the key. For example, if I can make ""door IS NOT STOP,"" then I can walk through it without needing the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `not`"" or something, but I don't see a ""not"" rule here. Alternatively, I can break the existing rule that makes the door a stop.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `stop`"" at 5 left and 4 up. If I can move that rule to make it ""door IS stop,"" but that would make the door stop me, which is the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""door IS YOU,"" then I can pass through it. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current rules.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""door IS YOU,"" then the door would become me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door IS NOT STOP,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. Maybe I can break the existing ""stop"" rule.

If I move the ""rule `stop`"" to combine it with something else, maybe I can change it. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""is"" and ""door,"" I can create ""door IS stop,"" but that would make the door stop me, which is bad.

Alternatively, if I can move ""is"" and ""stop"" to create a new rule that negates the stop, but I'm not sure how.

Maybe it's easier to just get the key and open the door. So, let's proceed with that plan.

So, the first step is to move right to get closer to the key.

But wait, the key is at 2 steps right, so I need to move right twice. Let me check if there are any walls in the way.

Looking at the walls, I see a wall at 3 steps left and 4 steps up, which is to the left, so not in my path. Another wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, also to the left. So, moving right should be clear.

So, I'll start by moving right.

I notice there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right, and a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I can use the key to open a door? There's a ""door"" 2 steps up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed towards the win.

But wait, the key is 1 step to the left, and the rule `key` is 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move the key closer or rearrange the rules to make the key accessible. Alternatively, perhaps I can change the rules to make the key into something else or make the door passable without a key.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be an obstacle, but since I'm Baba, I can move around it if needed. There are several walls, but I can move through them if I change the rules, perhaps by making them into something else.

Another thing I notice is the ""rule `ball`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to bounce or something, but I'm not sure how that would help right now.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I need to get to the win condition, I should probably move towards it. The win is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, moving right once and up four times would get me there, but I need to check if the path is clear.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might block my path if I go straight up. Maybe I can go around it. Alternatively, I can try to move the wall by rearranging the rules, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, if I move right once, I can get closer to the win. Let me try that. So, the action would be ""right."" That should move me one step to the right, bringing me closer to the win condition. Then, I can proceed up four steps if possible.

Alternatively, if moving right is blocked, I might need to adjust my path. But for now, moving right seems like a good first step to get closer to the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, the win condition is probably that object. I need to figure out how to get Baba to that position.

First, I should note the positions of all the relevant objects. The ""rule `stop`"" is 6 steps left and 4 up, which might be a barrier. The walls are scattered around, but I need to see if they block my path. The ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps up, which is probably part of another rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is 8 left and 3 up, which might define walls as something.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" 2 left and 2 up, a ""door"" 2 up, a ""key"" 1 left, and a ""rule `key`"" 1 right. There's also a ""rule `baba`"" 9 left and 2 down, ""rule `is`"" 8 left and 2 down, and ""rule `you`"" 7 left and 2 down. These might be parts of other rules that I can manipulate.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't pass through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the properties of walls or other objects.

Looking at the win condition, it's 1 right and 4 up. So, I need to move right once and up four times from my current position. But I need to check if there are any walls or other obstacles in that path.

The walls are at 4 left and 4 up, 4 left and 3 up, 4 left and 2 up, 4 left and 1 up, 4 left, 4 left and 1 down, and 4 left and 2 down. So, moving right from my current position, I might hit a wall at 4 left and 4 up. Wait, no, because I'm moving right, so maybe the walls are to the left, and I'm starting somewhere else.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the coordinate system. Let me try to visualize the map. If I'm at the origin (0,0), then moving left decreases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate. So, the ""rule `win`"" is at (1,4). The walls are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), and (4,-2). So, moving right from (0,0) to (1,4) would require moving right once and up four times, but I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Wait, no, because the walls are at x=4, which is far to the right. So, moving right once would take me to (1,0), and then up four times to (1,4). That seems possible unless there are walls in between. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at x=4, so they are four steps to the right, which is beyond my target position. So, the path to (1,4) should be clear.

But wait, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at (6 left, 4 up), which is (-6,4). That's far to the left, so it shouldn't interfere with my path to (1,4). The ""rule `wall`"" is at (8 left, 3 up), which is (-8,3). Also far away.

So, maybe I can just move right once and then up four times to reach the win condition. But I need to make sure that I can move that way without any obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules to change the win condition or make walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I could move through walls. But I don't see a ""rule `push`"" here, so that might not be possible.

Wait, I see a ""rule `key`"" at 1 step to the right. So, if I can pick up the key, maybe I can open a door. The door is at 2 up, which is (0,2). So, if I move up two steps, I can open the door with the key. But I'm not sure if that's necessary for reaching the win condition.

Let me think again. My goal is to reach the ""win"" object at (1,4). If I can move right once and up four times, that should do it. But I need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the walls are at x=4, which is beyond my target, I should be able to move freely.

So, the plan is: move right once to (1,0), then up four times to (1,4). That should trigger the win condition.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move as normal. Let me check if there are any other rules that might affect my movement. The ""rule `stop`"" is far away, so it shouldn't affect me. The ""rule `wall`"" is also far away, so walls shouldn't block me unless I'm near them.

Therefore, the best course of action is to move right once and then up four times. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I should start by moving right to get closer to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer. Let me see: moving up four times from (0,0) would take me to (0,4), and then right once to (1,4). That might be another way.

But I think moving right first is better because it gets me closer to the win object. So, I'll choose to move right.

But wait, I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. That might be an obstacle. I need to make sure I don't get stopped by that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else or break it.

Let me think about the movement. I'm currently at the starting position, and I need to move towards the win. The win is 1 step right and 4 up, so I need to move right once and up four times. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions.

There's a wall 4 steps left and 4 up, which is directly above the win. So, if I move right once, I'll be next to the wall. I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the wall or change its property.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to block the wall or something. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Wait, there's a ""rule `key`"" 1 step to the right. If I move right once, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open the door, which is 2 steps up. That might be the path to the win.

So, the plan is: move right to get the key, then move up to the door, use the key to open it, and then proceed to the win.

But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't get me stuck. Let me visualize the map. Starting position is where Baba is. Moving right once would take me to the key. Then, moving up twice would take me to the door. Using the key on the door would open it, allowing me to move up further to the win.

I think that's the way to go. So, the first step is to move right to get the key.
