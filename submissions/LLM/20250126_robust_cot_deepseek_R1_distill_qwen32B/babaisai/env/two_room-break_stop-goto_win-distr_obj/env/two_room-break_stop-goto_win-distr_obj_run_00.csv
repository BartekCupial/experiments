Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. But wait, there are walls in the way. Let me visualize the map. There are walls at various positions, including 2 steps right and 3 up, which might block my path. Also, there are several rule blocks scattered around, which I can potentially move to change the rules.

My goal is to get the key, which is the win condition. But the walls are in the way. Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable or turn them into something else.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" near each other. If I can move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall is stop"", I can break that rule. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is you"" or ""wall is push"" to make them movable.

Wait, but I can only move objects that aren't defined as stop. So, I need to see if I can move the rule blocks. The rule blocks are text, so they can be moved unless they're part of a rule that makes them stop. Currently, ""wall is stop"" applies to walls, not the rule blocks themselves. So I can move the rule blocks.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key, but walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Another idea: if I can make the walls into something else, like ""win"" or ""you"", that might help. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""baba is push"" to push the walls, but I don't know if that's possible.

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, I can move Baba, but walls are stop. So, I can't go through walls. The key is at 6 right, 1 up. Let me see the path. From my starting position, I need to go right 6 and up 1. But there are walls at 2 right, 3 up, which might block that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can go around. Let me check the other walls. There are walls at 2 right, 2 up; 2 right, 1 up; 2 right; 2 right, 1 down; 2 right, 2 down; and 3 right, 2 down. So, the area to the right is mostly blocked by walls except maybe below.

Wait, the ball is at 3 right, 2 down. Maybe that's a clue. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Let me think about the rule blocks. There's a ""baba"" rule block at 3 left, 3 down; ""is"" at 2 left, 3 down; and ""you"" at 1 left, 3 down. If I can move these, I can change the ""baba is you"" rule. But I don't know if that's necessary.

Alternatively, the ""key"" rule block is at 5 right, 3 up, along with ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. If I can move the ""key"" block to change the win condition, but I think the key is already the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" by moving the ""push"" block, but I don't see a ""push"" block. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is you"" so that I can move through them, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. Let me see where the ""stop"" block is. It's at 1 left, 2 up. So, if I can move that, I can change the rule.

So, my plan is: move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to get to the ""stop"" block. Let me see how to get there.

From my starting position, I can move left 1 and up 2 to reach the ""stop"" block. But are there walls in the way? Let me check. The walls are mostly to the right, so moving left might be possible.

Wait, the starting position is where Baba is. Let me assume I'm at (0,0). The walls are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), and (3,-2). So, moving left from (0,0) to (-1,2) where the ""stop"" block is, I need to go left 1 and up 2. But are there any walls blocking that path? It seems not, as the walls are to the right.

So, I can move left, up, up to reach the ""stop"" block. Once there, I can move it somewhere else, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, walls won't stop me anymore, and I can move through them.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by placing ""stop"" elsewhere. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to another subject, like ""key"", making ""key is stop"", but that might not help.

Wait, but if I break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls become passable. So, I can move through them. That would allow me to reach the key.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block: left, up, up.
2. Move the ""stop"" block away, breaking the rule.
3. Then, move through the walls to reach the key.

But wait, I can only move one block at a time. So, I need to plan each move carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to change the rule. But I think moving ""stop"" is the key.

So, first, I need to move left to get to the ""stop"" block. Let me see the exact path.

From (0,0), moving left once gets me to (-1,0). Then, up twice gets me to (-1,2), where the ""stop"" block is. So, the actions would be left, up, up.

But wait, the initial position might not be (0,0). Let me check the objects again. The key is at 6 right, 1 up, so I'm probably starting somewhere else. But regardless, the relative positions are what matter.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block. If I can move the ""wall"" block next to ""is"" and ""push"", making ""wall is push"", but I don't see a ""push"" block.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""you"", making ""wall is you"", which would allow me to move through walls as if they were me.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, making ""baba is push"" would allow me to push walls, but I don't see a ""push"" block.

Hmm, maybe the simplest way is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. So, I need to get to the ""stop"" block.

So, the first step is to move left once, then up twice. But I need to output just one action. So, the first action would be left.

Wait, but the user is asking for the best course of action, then choose one action. So, perhaps the first step is to move left to start getting to the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the key, but the walls are in the way. So, it's better to break the wall rule first.

So, the first action is left.
</think>

To start breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, I'll move left to reach the ""stop"" block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I control the Baba character.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. To reach it, I need to figure out the path. But there are walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various points, especially around the key, so I might need to move some text blocks to change the rules or create a path.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""key"" rule 6 steps right and 3 up, an ""is"" rule next to it, and a ""win"" rule further right. Similarly, on the left, there are ""wall,"" ""is,"" and ""stop"" rules. Also, there are ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" rules near the bottom.

Since the key is the win condition, maybe I can change that. If I can move the ""key"" rule away or replace it, perhaps I can make something else the win condition. Alternatively, I could make the walls passable by changing their property.

Wait, the walls are defined as ""stop,"" which means they can't be moved through. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make walls passable. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, or replace it with something else, the walls might no longer block me.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see a ""stop"" rule 2 steps up. If I can move that, perhaps I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something else.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" Since the rule blocks are text, they might be movable. So, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to somewhere else, which would break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule by rearranging the text blocks. For example, if I move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I could form ""key is win,"" but that's already the active rule. Maybe I can create a different rule, like ""baba is win,"" so that when I reach the key, I win, but if I change myself to be the win condition, maybe I can win without the key.

Wait, the current win condition is the key. So if I can make myself the win condition, then just being in a certain place would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible here.

Another approach: the ball is at 4 steps right and 2 down. Maybe the ball can be used somehow, but I'm not sure how. Maybe if I can make the ball the win condition, but that might not help.

Let me think about the path. The key is 7 right and 1 up. To get there, I need to go right 7 steps, but there are walls in the way. If I can make the walls passable, I can go through them. So, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

To do that, I can move the ""stop"" rule block. It's currently 2 steps up. If I move it away, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, and walls would no longer stop me. So, I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location, perhaps next to another word to form a new rule.

But how do I move it? I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. Since it's a text block, I can move it by moving into it. So, I need to get to where the ""stop"" rule is, which is 2 steps up. From my current position, I need to move up twice to reach it.

Wait, but I'm at the starting position. Let me check the objects again. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up. So, if I move up twice, I can reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like to the right or left, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule block. The ""wall"" rule is 2 steps left and 2 up. If I move that, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken as well.

But moving the ""stop"" rule might be easier. So, my plan is:

1. Move up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule block.
2. Move it to a new location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Then, I can move through the walls to reach the key.

But wait, I can only move one step at a time. So, I need to choose the action that gets me closer to the ""stop"" rule.

Looking at the current position, I need to move up twice. So, the first step is to move up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first to get around, but there are walls blocking the way. So, moving up to change the rule seems necessary.

So, the first action should be ""up"" to start moving towards the ""stop"" rule.
</think>

To start moving towards the ""stop"" rule block, which is two steps up, the first action is to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I control the Baba character.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 7 steps to the right. My goal is to get to the key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without being blocked by walls.

First, I'll note the positions of the walls. There are walls at various points, especially around the key. I see walls 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, and so on. It seems like the key is surrounded by walls, making it hard to reach directly.

I also notice there are rule blocks scattered around. These can be moved to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule block, I might be able to change what counts as the win condition or alter the properties of the key.

Wait, the key is 7 steps to the right. That's quite far. I need to see if there's a path. Let me visualize the map. Starting from my position, I can move right, but there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move up or down to find a path.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""rule `key`"" at 6 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that, perhaps I can create a new rule. Maybe I can make ""key is something else"" or change the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. If I can make walls not stop me, I could walk through them. But how? The current rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can change that, maybe by moving the ""stop"" rule block elsewhere, I can make walls passable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. If I can move that, perhaps I can attach it to something else. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to another object, walls might no longer stop me.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I could win by just being where I am. But that might not be possible because the key is the current win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the win condition. The ball is at 4 steps right and 3 down. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I just need to reach the ball instead of the key. But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Wait, the ball is at 4 right and 3 down. That might be a shorter path. But I need to see if I can get there without being blocked.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. For example, if I can make ""key is something else,"" maybe I can redefine what wins.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the movement. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to plan a path.

Starting from my position, I can move right, but there's a wall 3 right and 2 up. So maybe I can go up first. Let me try moving up. If I move up, I can check if there's a path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. If I move up, I might be able to interact with that rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to change the wall's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make walls not stop me.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is active. If I can change that, maybe by moving the ""stop"" rule to another object, walls would no longer stop me.

So, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule block to another object, like the ball. Then, walls wouldn't stop me, and the ball would stop me instead. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different position, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is stop,"" which would make the ball an obstacle, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the key. Then, the key would be stop, making it immovable, but that might not help me win.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the key's position again. It's 7 steps to the right. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a way to move the key closer.

Wait, the key is an object, so maybe I can move it. But the key is defined as ""key is win,"" so it's a win condition. I can't move it unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move the key. For example, if I can make ""key is push,"" then I could push it towards me.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule block. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" and ""push"" blocks, but I don't see a ""push"" block in the objects.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 4 right and 3 down. If I can make the ball the win condition, then I just need to reach the ball instead of the key.

To do that, I need to change the win condition. The current win condition is the key. So I need to make ""ball is win."" How can I do that?

I can move the ""win"" rule block. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 2 up. If I can move that to the ball's position, I can create a new rule ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule block would require me to get there, which is 8 steps right and 2 up. That's a long path, and I might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. The ""key"" rule is at 6 right and 2 up. If I can move that to the ball, I can make ""ball is key,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can make ""key is you."" Then, the key would become me, and I could win by being where the key is. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so I become the key and win. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key, and thus win. But how?

I need to move the ""key"" rule block to where Baba is. But the ""key"" rule block is at 6 right and 2 up. I need to get there.

But the path is blocked by walls. Let me see if I can move up first. If I move up, I can check if there's a way to get to the ""key"" rule block.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make walls passable. Let me try moving up.

If I move up, I can interact with the ""stop"" rule block. Maybe I can move it to another position. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule block to the ball, then walls wouldn't stop me, and the ball would stop me instead.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different object, maybe I can make walls passable.

Wait, if I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them. So, if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move through walls.

How can I do that? I need to move the ""stop"" rule block away from the wall. The ""wall"" rule block is at 2 left and 1 up. The ""stop"" rule block is at 1 step up.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule block to another object, like the ball, then the wall would no longer be stop. So, I can walk through walls.

So, the plan is: move up to get to the ""stop"" rule block, then move it to the ball's position, making ""ball is stop."" Then, walls won't stop me, and I can walk through them to reach the key.

But wait, the ball is at 4 right and 3 down. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a closer object.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the ""key"" rule block, making ""key is stop."" But that would make the key immovable, which might not help.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to move the ""stop"" rule block to the ball, so walls are no longer stop. Then, I can walk through walls to reach the key.

So, first, I need to move up to get to the ""stop"" rule block. Let me try moving up.

After moving up, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule block. Then, I need to move it to the ball's position. But the ball is 4 right and 3 down from my starting position. That's a long way, and I might be blocked by walls.

Wait, if I can move through walls after changing the rule, maybe I can get there. But I need to change the rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a different rule block, like the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks, to create a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule block to the ""is"" rule block, I can create ""is is stop,"" which might not make sense. Or if I move it to the ""win"" rule block, making ""win is stop,"" which would make the win condition stop me, which might not help.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the key's position again. It's 7 steps to the right. If I can find a way to move right without being blocked, I can reach it.

Looking at the walls, there are walls at 3 right and 2 up, 3 right and 1 up, 3 right, 3 right and 1 down, 3 right and 2 down, 3 right and 3 down, and 3 right and 4 down. So, the key is at 7 right, which is beyond these walls. Maybe there's a path around.

Wait, if I move down, maybe I can go around the walls. Let me check. The ball is at 4 right and 3 down. If I can get there, maybe I can use it somehow.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to make the key win somewhere else.

Wait, the ""key"" rule block is at 6 right and 2 up. If I can move that to the ball's position, I can make ""ball is key,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" so I become the key and win. But I need to move the ""key"" rule block to where I am.

But that's 6 right and 2 up, which is blocked by walls. So, I can't get there directly.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to change the rules. The ""is"" rule blocks are at various positions. If I can move one to create a new rule, that might help.

For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being where I am. But I need to move the ""win"" rule block to where Baba is.

The ""win"" rule block is at 8 right and 2 up. That's too far. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule block to the ball's position, making ""ball is win.""

But again, that's a long path. Maybe I can find a way to move the rule blocks without going through walls.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule block first. If I can make walls passable, I can move through them to reach the rule blocks.

So, the plan is:

1. Move up to get to the ""stop"" rule block.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule block to another object, like the ball, making ""ball is stop.""
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.
4. Then, I can move right to reach the key.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule block doesn't block my path. Let me try moving up first.

After moving up, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule block. Then, I need to move it to the ball's position. But the ball is 4 right and 3 down. That's a bit far, but if I can move through walls now, maybe I can get there.

Wait, no, because I haven't changed the rule yet. I need to move the ""stop"" rule block first to make walls passable.

So, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the ball, then walls become passable, and I can move through them to reach the key.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can try moving up and then right to see if I can get to the ""key"" rule block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block. The ""wall"" rule block is at 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is active. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block to another object, like the ball, then the ball would be stop, and walls would no longer be stop.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left twice and up once to get to the ""wall"" rule block.
2. Move the ""wall"" rule block to the ball's position, making ""ball is wall.""
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.
4. Then, I can move right to reach the key.

But moving left twice and up once might be blocked by walls. Let me check the map again.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule block is at 2 left and 1 up. So, from my starting position, I can move left twice and up once to reach it. But are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the objects, there are walls at 3 right and various up and down positions, but moving left, I might not encounter walls. Let me try moving left twice and up once.

After moving left twice and up once, I can pick up the ""wall"" rule block. Then, I need to move it to the ball's position, which is 4 right and 3 down from my starting position.

But moving right from the ""wall"" rule block's position (2 left and 1 up) would require moving right 6 steps to reach 4 right. That's a long way, and I might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block to a closer object, like the ""is"" rule block at 1 left and 1 up. Then, the rule would be ""is is wall,"" which might not help.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the key again. It's 7 steps to the right. If I can find a way to move right without being blocked, I can reach it.

Wait, the key is at 7 right. Let me count the steps. From my starting position, moving right 7 times would get me there. But there are walls at 3 right and various up and down positions. So, I need to find a path that goes around the walls.

Maybe I can move up first to go over the walls. Let me try moving up. If I move up, I can check if there's a path.

After moving up, I can see if I can move right further. But the ""stop"" rule block is at 1 step up, so I can interact with it.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule block, I can change the wall's properties. Let me try moving up to get to the ""stop"" rule block.

After moving up, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule block. Then, I need to move it to another object to change the rule.

If I move the ""stop"" rule block to the ball, making ""ball is stop,"" then walls would no longer stop me. So, I can walk through walls.

Then, I can move right through the walls to reach the key.

So, the steps are:

1. Move up to get to the ""stop"" rule block.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule block to the ball's position, making ""ball is stop.""
3. Now, walls are passable.
4. Move right 7 steps to reach the key and win.

But I need to make sure I can reach the ball's position to move the ""stop"" rule block there. Let me see.

The ball is at 4 right and 3 down. From the ""stop"" rule block's position (1 up), I need to move down 4 steps and right 3 steps. But with walls in the way, it's tricky.

Wait, if I can move through walls after changing the rule, maybe I can get there. But I need to change the rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a closer object, like the ""is"" rule block at 1 left and 1 up. Then, the rule would be ""is is stop,"" which might not help.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try moving up to get to the ""stop"" rule block and then move it to the ball.

So, first, I move up. Then, I pick up the ""stop"" rule block. Then, I move down 4 steps and right 3 steps to the ball's position. But I'm not sure if I can do that without being blocked.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 7 steps to the right. There are also several walls and rule blocks. The rule blocks are spread out, and I need to figure out how to move them to change the rules.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but walls are stopping me. The key is pretty far to the right, so I need to get past the walls. Maybe I can rearrange the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""key is you"", then the key would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I could win by being myself, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is the win condition, so I need to get the key. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the walls. If I can make ""wall is not stop"", then walls wouldn't stop me anymore. But how?

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step up, an ""is"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step up, and a ""stop"" rule 1 step up. If I can move these to form a new rule like ""wall is not stop"", that would allow me to pass through walls.

So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule to the left, the ""is"" rule to the left, and the ""stop"" rule down. But I'm not sure how to do that step by step. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule first to create space.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can bring it down, maybe I can form a new rule that helps me get the key.

Wait, the key is 7 steps to the right. I'm at the starting position, so I need to move right multiple times. But the walls are blocking me. So, changing the wall rules seems necessary.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the left. If I move left once, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, maybe I can move it down to form a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down to change the wall's property. If I can make ""wall is not stop"", that would help.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule to the left, then move the ""stop"" rule down to create ""wall is not stop"". That way, walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the key.

So, first, I need to move left to get to the ""is"" rule. Then, move it down. After that, move the ""stop"" rule down to form the new rule.

But I'm not sure if I can do that in one move. Maybe I need to plan each step carefully.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I move left once, I can reach it. Then, moving it down would place it below, which might help in forming the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the left to create space. But I'm not sure.

I think the key is to change the wall's property so I can pass through. So, moving the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule to form ""wall is not stop"" is the way to go.

So, my first move should be to move left to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 8 steps to the right. There are also several walls and rule blocks. The rule blocks are spread out, and I need to figure out how to move them to change the rules.

My goal is to get the key, which is the win condition. But the key is pretty far to the right, and there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or change what counts as a wall.

I notice that there are rule blocks for ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". If I can move these, I might be able to create a new rule that changes the properties of walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then walls won't block me anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into something else, like a ball, which might have different properties. There's a ball object on the map, so perhaps if I can change the rule to ""baba is ball"", I can move through walls or something.

Wait, but the ball is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's a bit far. Maybe I should focus on the walls first. If I can make walls not stop me, I can move through them to reach the key.

So, how do I move the rule blocks? I need to move the ""wall"" rule block and the ""stop"" rule block next to each other with an ""is"" block in between. That would create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" or ""wall is not stop"".

Looking at the positions, the ""wall"" rule block is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. The ""is"" rule block is 1 step up, and the ""stop"" rule block is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So they're all in the upper part of the map.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule block to the right, I can place it next to the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks. But I'm currently at the starting position, which is where Baba is. I need to move right to get closer to the rule blocks.

Wait, but the walls are blocking my path. There are walls 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and others in similar positions. Maybe I can move up first to get around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block somewhere else so that walls no longer stop me. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then walls won't have that property anymore.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop"". Since the rule blocks are just text, I can move them as long as they're not part of a rule that makes them stop.

Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop"", so walls are stop, but the rule blocks themselves aren't walls, so I can move them. So I can move the ""wall"" rule block, the ""is"" rule block, and the ""stop"" rule block.

Let me plan this out. I need to create a new rule that changes the properties of walls. Maybe ""wall is not stop"". To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule block, an ""is"" block, and a ""not stop"" block into a line.

But I don't have a ""not"" rule block. Hmm. Maybe I can break the existing rule. If I move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the rule would be broken, and walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

So, the current rule is ""wall is stop"". If I move the ""stop"" block away, the rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be stop. That would allow me to move through walls.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is you"", which would make walls moveable, but that might not be necessary.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. That would break the rule, making walls passable.

Looking at the positions, the ""stop"" rule block is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. The ""wall"" rule block is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. The ""is"" block is 1 step up.

If I move the ""stop"" block down, away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" blocks, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" block. But how? I can move it by moving into it. Since I'm Baba, and the rule blocks are just text, I can move them.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move towards the rule blocks. Let me see: the rule blocks are 1 step up, so I can move up to reach them.

So, first, I'll move up to get to the ""is"" block. Then, I can move right to get to the ""stop"" block and move it down.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" block to the right, so that it's next to the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks, but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to move the ""stop"" block down, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. That way, walls become passable.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" block.
2. Move right to reach the ""stop"" block.
3. Move the ""stop"" block down, breaking the rule.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" block doesn't create a new rule that's problematic.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" block to the right, so that it's next to the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks, but that might not change anything.

Wait, perhaps I should try moving the ""stop"" block down first. Let me try that.

So, I'll move up to the ""is"" block, then right to the ""stop"" block, and then move it down. That should break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.

Once walls are passable, I can move through them to reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key"", which would make me the key, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, the key is 8 steps to the right. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path once walls are passable.

So, the main goal is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block away. That should allow me to move through walls and reach the key.

So, the first action I need to take is to move up to start moving towards the rule blocks.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. My goal is to get to that key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

First, I should check the walls. There are walls at various positions, including 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, 4 steps right, 4 right and 1 down, and so on. These walls are probably blocking my path. Since ""wall is stop,"" I can't move through them.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a rule ""is"" 1 step up, which might be part of another rule if I can move it. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps right and 1 up, ""win"" is 9 right and 1 up, and ""wall"" is 1 left. There's also a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right. 

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange these rules to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it might make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" then I could become the key and win immediately, but I don't see that option right now.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba. So I need to move right to reach the key. Let me count the steps. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. I'm currently at the starting position, so moving right 8 times and then down once should get me there. But are there walls in the way?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up, which is above me, so that shouldn't block my path to the right. The wall at 4 right is directly in front of me, so I can't go past that unless I can move it. But walls are ""stop,"" so I can't move through them. 

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to another position, the wall might no longer stop me. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's 1 step to the right. So if I move it somewhere else, maybe the wall at 4 right won't be a stop anymore.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule, I might create a new rule like ""key is something,"" but I'm not sure what that would do.

Wait, the ""key is win"" rule is already active, so maybe I don't need to change that. I just need to get to the key. Let me try moving right as much as possible. I can move right 4 steps, but then there's a wall. Maybe I can go around it by moving down first. 

If I move down once, I can then move right past the wall. Let me check the positions. Moving down once would take me to 4 right and 1 down, which is a wall. Oh, that's a wall too. So I can't move down there. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move up first. If I move up, I can go around the wall. Let me see. Moving up once would take me to 4 right and 1 up, which is a wall. That's also blocked. 

This is tricky. Maybe I need to break the wall by changing its rule. If I can move the ""wall"" rule somewhere else, the wall might disappear or become passable. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left. If I move it to another position, maybe the wall at 4 right won't be a wall anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different object, making that object stop instead of the wall. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to the ball, then the ball would stop me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ball is at 5 right and 4 down. That's far away. Maybe I can ignore it for now. 

Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. It's 1 step to the right. If I move it left, it would be next to the ""wall"" rule, which is already 1 left. Maybe that would create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. 

Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" rule up or down, maybe I can make another object stop. But I'm not sure. 

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule, I might create a new rule like ""key is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would change the key's properties.

Wait, the key is already ""win,"" so maybe I don't need to change that. I just need to reach it. 

Let me try to move right as much as possible. I can move right 4 steps, but then I hit a wall. Maybe I can move up or down to go around. 

If I move up once, I'm at 4 right and 1 up, which is a wall. Can't go there. If I move down once, I'm at 4 right and 1 down, which is also a wall. So I'm stuck.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the wall's rule. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to another position, the wall at 4 right might no longer be a wall. Let me try that. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left. If I move it to the right, maybe the wall at 4 right won't be a wall anymore.

So, I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right. Let's see, moving it right once would take it to the same position as the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 right. That might create a new rule like ""stop is wall,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, moving the ""wall"" rule up or down might make it apply to a different object. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move it to the right, it would be next to the ""key"" rule at 7 right and 1 up. That would create ""key is something,"" but I'm not sure what.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule down might help. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. If I can move it to another position, the wall might no longer stop me. 

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule up. It's currently 1 step to the right. If I move it up, it would be at 1 right and 1 up, which is a wall. That might make the wall stop me, but I'm already blocked by it.

Alternatively, moving the ""stop"" rule down. It would be at 1 right and 1 down. That's an empty space, so maybe the wall at 4 right won't be a stop anymore.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule down, the wall at 4 right might no longer be a stop, allowing me to pass through. Let me try that.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule down. To do that, I can move down once from its current position. That would take it to 1 right and 1 down. 

After moving the ""stop"" rule down, the wall at 4 right might no longer be a stop, so I can move through it. Then I can proceed to the key.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule down, then move right past the wall to reach the key.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it by moving myself next to it and then moving in the direction I want it to go. 

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. So I can move right once to be next to it, then move down to push it down.

Let me try that. 

First, move right to be next to the ""stop"" rule. Then, move down to push it down. 

After that, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. Now, the wall at 4 right might not be a stop anymore, so I can move through it.

Then, I can move right past the wall at 4 right and continue to the key at 8 right and 1 down.

So, the actions would be: right, down, then right multiple times and down once.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule down actually changes the wall's properties. 

Alternatively, maybe moving the ""stop"" rule away from the wall doesn't affect it because the wall's rule is already set. I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is 7 right and 1 up. If I can move it down, it would be closer to me.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""key"" rule. I need to be next to it and then move in the direction I want it to go. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. That might make the key something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is already ""win,"" so maybe I don't need to change that. I just need to reach it.

Let me try moving right as much as possible. I can move right 4 steps, but then I hit a wall. Maybe I can move up or down to go around.

If I move up once, I'm at 4 right and 1 up, which is a wall. Can't go there. If I move down once, I'm at 4 right and 1 down, which is also a wall. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, moving the ""wall"" rule up or down might make it apply to a different object.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move it to the right, it would be next to the ""key"" rule at 7 right and 1 up. That would create ""key is something,"" but I'm not sure what.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule down might help.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. If I can move it to another position, the wall might no longer be a stop, allowing me to pass through.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. There are also walls and some rule blocks. The rule blocks are important because I can move them to create new rules or change existing ones.

I need to get to the key to win. But the key is pretty far to the right. Let me see if there's a way to move the rule blocks to make this easier. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or something.

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" There's also a ""wall is stop"" rule, which means walls block movement. I can't move through walls. So, I need to find a way to either remove the walls or change the rules so that walls don't stop me.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""rule `is` 1 step up,"" ""rule `key` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" and so on. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to combine it with another word to create a new rule. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I might be able to make ""win is something else.""

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is key"" so that I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me think about the positions. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is the origin (0,0). So, to get to the key, I need to move right 8 times and down once. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions.

There's a wall 4 steps right and 1 up, another at 4 right, and others down. So, moving straight right might be blocked by walls. Maybe I can go around them by moving down first, but that might not help because the walls extend down as well.

Wait, there's a ball 5 steps right and 4 down. Maybe the ball can be used somehow, but I'm not sure how. Balls in Baba Is You usually push things, but I don't see an immediate use here.

Another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule block, maybe I can make walls not stop me. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" that would allow me to move through walls. But how can I do that?

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right."" If I can move the ""stop"" block next to ""wall,"" I might be able to create ""wall is stop"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe I need to negate it somehow.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""not"" or another word, but I don't see a ""not"" block here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can break the existing rules. If I move the ""is"" block away from ""key"" and ""win,"" maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition or my properties.

Let me try to plan my movements. I need to get to the key, but walls are in the way. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me see: moving up one step would take me to (0,1). Then, I can move right, but there's a wall at (4,1). So, I can go up to (0,2), but I don't see any walls there. Wait, the walls are at (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), etc. So, moving up might give me a clearer path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first. Let's see: moving down to (0,-1), but there's a wall at (4,-1). So, that might not help.

Wait, the key is at (8,-1). So, if I can get past the walls at (4,0) and beyond, I can reach it. But how?

Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass"" or something, but I don't see a ""pass"" block. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop.""

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall."" Let me see where the ""stop"" block is. It's 1 step to the right. So, if I can move it somewhere else, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? I can only move blocks that are not defined as ""stop."" Wait, the ""stop"" block is part of the rule ""wall is stop,"" so it's immovable unless I change that rule.

This seems a bit circular. Maybe I need a different approach.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, and I can win by being on the key. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so that when I step on the key, I win. But again, I'm not sure how to rearrange the blocks for that.

Wait, let's look at the rule blocks again. There's a ""rule `is` 1 step up,"" which is at (0,1). If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""key,"" I can create ""key is something."" But I need to move it, and I can only move it if it's not stopped by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block. The ""key"" rule block is at (7,1). If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is key,"" but that's already the case.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to move towards the key step by step, even if it means moving through walls, but I can't because walls are stop.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" block. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop.""

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall."" But the ""stop"" block is at (1,0). If I can move it somewhere else, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? It's part of the rule ""wall is stop,"" so it's immovable unless I change that rule. So, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at (0,1). If I can move it next to ""stop,"" I can create ""stop is something,"" which might change the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" block. The ""wall"" rule block is at (-1,1). If I can move it next to ""not,"" but there's no ""not"" block.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving in a different direction. Let me see: if I move up, I can avoid some walls, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is at (8,-1). If I can move right 8 steps and down 1, but walls are in the way. Maybe I can go around the walls by moving up first, then right, then down.

Let me try that. Move up to (0,1), then right to (4,1), but there's a wall there. So, I can't go further right. Hmm.

Alternatively, move up to (0,2), then right. But I don't see any walls at (4,2), so maybe I can go all the way right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), but the key is at (8,-1). That's too far down.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move down through walls. If I can make ""down is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is down,"" but that doesn't make sense.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. But I can't move it because it's part of that rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block. If I can move the ""is"" block at (0,1) next to ""stop"" at (1,0), I can create ""stop is something,"" which might change the rule.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I can move it if it's not stopped. Since it's a rule block, maybe I can move it by being Baba.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move the ""is"" block if it's not stopped. Let me try to move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (4,1). No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block down to (0,0), then right. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the left. Let me try moving left from (0,1) to (-1,1), but there's a wall at (-1,1). So, I can't.

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let me look at the ball. The ball is at (5,-4). Maybe I can use it to push something, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key or something. But I don't see a way to do that.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so that stepping on the ball wins the level. But the key is the current win condition.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key step by step, even if it means moving through walls, but I can't because walls are stop.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" block. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop.""

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block away from ""wall."" But the ""stop"" block is at (1,0). If I can move it somewhere else, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? It's part of the rule ""wall is stop,"" so it's immovable unless I change that rule.

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to move the ""key"" block. The ""key"" rule block is at (7,1). If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is key,"" but that's already the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block next to ""you,"" making ""you is key,"" so that I become the key and win. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can step on the key and win. But how do I rearrange the blocks for that?

The ""baba"" rule block is at (-1,4). If I can move it next to ""is,"" then next to ""key,"" I can create ""baba is key."" But moving it requires moving through walls, which I can't do.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another way. Let me see: the key is at (8,-1). If I can move down first, then right, but walls are in the way.

Wait, maybe I can move down to (0,-1), but there's a wall at (4,-1). So, I can't go further right.

Alternatively, move down to (0,-2), but I don't see any walls there. Wait, the walls are at (4,-1), (4,-2), etc. So, moving down to (0,-2), then right to (4,-2), but there's a wall there.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to give up and just move towards the key as much as possible.

Wait, let me try to move right as much as I can. From (0,0), I can move right to (4,0), but there's a wall there. So, I can't go further.

Alternatively, move up to (0,1), then right to (4,1), but there's a wall there too.

Wait, maybe I can move up to (0,2), then right to (4,2), but I don't see any walls there. So, I can go all the way right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), but the key is at (8,-1). That's too far down.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move down through walls. If I can make ""down is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" block.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me think about the rule blocks again. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something else."" But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""win"" rule block is at (9,1). If I can move it next to ""key,"" I can make ""key is win,"" which is already the case. So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" block next to ""you,"" making ""you is win,"" so that I win when I step on myself. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so that I win when I step on Baba. But I'm already Baba, so that might not help.

This is really frustrating. I think I need to try moving towards the key step by step, even if it means moving through walls, but I can't because walls are stop.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" block. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. There are also walls and some rule blocks. The walls are stopping me from moving through them, so I need to figure out how to get around them or change the rules to make them passable.

I notice that there are rule blocks scattered around. Maybe I can move some of them to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, they might no longer block me. Alternatively, I could try to make the walls into something else, like ""win"" or ""you,"" but that might not be necessary.

Wait, the key is the win condition, so if I can reach the key, I win. But the walls are in the way. Let me see the layout. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. To get there, I might need to move around the walls. Are there any gaps or possible paths?

Looking at the walls, they're placed at 4 steps right and various steps up and down. There's a wall at 4 right, 1 up, and another at 4 right, 1 down. So maybe I can go around them by moving up or down more.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove the stop property, then I can walk through them. But how?

I see there's a ""stop"" rule block at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. But to move it, I need to be adjacent to it. Let me check where I am. Since I'm Baba, I'm probably at the starting position, which is where the ""baba is you"" rule is.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So I'm somewhere near there. Maybe I can move towards the ""stop"" rule block. Let me plan the steps.

First, I need to get to the ""stop"" rule block. It's 1 step right and 1 step up from my current position. So I can move right once and up once. But are there walls blocking that path? Let me check.

There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So if I'm moving right once, I'm at 1 right, which is clear. Then up once would take me to 1 right and 1 up, which is where the ""stop"" rule is. So I can move there.

Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. But wait, can I do that? In Baba Is You, you can only move rule blocks if they're not part of a rule. Since ""stop"" is part of ""wall is stop,"" moving it might break that rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by placing the ""stop"" block elsewhere. For example, if I place it next to another subject, like ""key,"" making ""key is stop,"" which would prevent the key from being the win condition. But that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" block to make a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls aside. But I don't see a ""push"" rule block here. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can become a wall and walk through other walls, but that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself, but that's already the case since ""key is win.""

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the key's position again. It's 8 steps right and 1 step down. To get there, I need to move right 8 times and down once. But there are walls in the way. Let me see if there's a path around them.

Looking at the walls, they're at 4 right and various steps up and down. So maybe I can go up higher or lower to bypass them. For example, if I move up more, I might find a path. Let me check the objects again.

There's a ball at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. Maybe that's a distraction. The key is at 8 right, 1 down. So perhaps I can move right as much as possible, then down once. But the walls are blocking the way at 4 right. So I need to find a way to get past 4 right.

Wait, maybe I can move the wall at 4 right, 1 up. If I can make that wall passable, I can go through. But how? If I can change the rule so that walls are not stop, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall"" rule.

So, the ""wall is stop"" rule is active. If I can move the ""stop"" block to another location, the rule will be broken, and walls will no longer stop me. Let me try that.

I need to get to the ""stop"" rule block, which is 1 step right and 1 step up. So I'll move right once and up once. Then, I can pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, like next to the ""key"" block, making ""key is stop,"" which would prevent the key from being the win condition. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can move it to a place where it doesn't form a rule, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" block away, the ""wall is stop"" rule will be broken, and walls will no longer stop me. So I can walk through them. That would allow me to reach the key.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right once to reach the position next to the ""stop"" rule block.
2. Move up once to be adjacent to the ""stop"" block.
3. Pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But wait, in the game, you can only move one block at a time, and you can't hold onto blocks; you can only push or pull them. So I need to be next to the ""stop"" block and then move in the direction away from it to push it.

So, after moving right once and up once, I'm next to the ""stop"" block. Then, I can move left or down to push it. Let's say I move left, pushing the ""stop"" block to the left. Now, the ""stop"" block is no longer part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, so walls are no longer stop.

Now, I can move through the walls. So I can proceed right past the walls at 4 right and continue towards the key.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right once.
2. Move up once.
3. Move left once, pushing the ""stop"" block to the left.
4. Now, walls are passable. Move right again to 4 right, then continue right to 8 right.
5. Move down once to reach the key.

Wait, but after pushing the ""stop"" block, I need to make sure that the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. So, the ""stop"" block is now somewhere else, not connected to ""wall."" So walls are no longer stop.

So, I can now move through the walls. Let me confirm the path:

- Starting position: let's say I'm at (0,0).
- Move right to (1,0).
- Move up to (1,1), which is where the ""stop"" block is.
- Move left to (0,1), pushing the ""stop"" block to (0,1).
- Now, the ""stop"" block is at (0,1), so the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken.
- Now, I can move right to (1,1), then right to (2,1), and so on, passing through the walls at (4,1) because they're no longer stop.

Wait, but the walls are at 4 right and various steps up and down. So, after breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can walk through them. So, I can proceed right to 8 right, then down once to reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move right and down without worrying about the walls now.

So, the actions would be:

1. right
2. up
3. left (to push the ""stop"" block)
4. right (to get back to the path)
5. right (to move past the walls)
6. right (continuing right)
7. right (to 4 right)
8. right (to 5 right)
9. right (to 6 right)
10. right (to 7 right)
11. right (to 8 right)
12. down (to reach the key)

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, after pushing the ""stop"" block, I can move right and down directly to the key.

Wait, the key is at 8 right, 1 down. So, after breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move right 8 times and down once, passing through any walls in the way.

So, the main action is to move right once, up once, left once to push the ""stop"" block, then proceed right and down to the key.

But in the game, each move is a single step, so I need to output each action one by one. However, the user is asking for a single action each time. So, in this case, the first action would be to move right to get closer to the ""stop"" block.

Wait, but in the previous observations, the user was trying to move left and up but didn't get a valid action. So, perhaps the first step is to move right to reach the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get to the ""stop"" block more directly.

Wait, the ""stop"" block is 1 step right and 1 step up from my current position. So, moving right then up would get me there. Alternatively, moving up then right.

But in the game, movement is grid-based, so the order might not matter as long as I reach the adjacent position.

So, perhaps the first action is to move right to get closer to the ""stop"" block.

But let me double-check the positions. The ""stop"" block is at 1 right, 1 up. So, from my current position, I need to move right once and up once to be next to it.

So, the first action would be to move right.

Wait, but in the previous observation, the user tried moving left and up but didn't get a valid action. So, maybe the correct first step is to move right.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so moving right then up would get me there.

But I'm not sure if the user's previous attempts were correct. So, perhaps the best first action is to move right to start moving towards the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first would be better, but I think moving right is the first step.

Wait, but in the current observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So, from my current position, I need to move right once and up once to reach it.

So, the first action is to move right.

But in the previous attempt, the user tried moving left and up, which might not have been correct. So, perhaps the correct first action is to move right.

Alternatively, maybe the user is at a different position, and moving left is correct. But based on the current observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 right, 1 up, so moving right is the first step.

Wait, but in the current observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So, from my current position, I need to move right once and up once to reach it.

So, the first action is to move right.

But in the previous attempt, the user tried moving left and up, which might not have been correct. So, perhaps the correct first action is to move right.

Alternatively, maybe the user is at a different position, and moving left is correct. But based on the current observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 right, 1 up, so moving right is the first step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. There are also several walls and rule blocks. The walls are stopping me from moving through them, so I need to figure out how to get around them or change the rules to make them passable.

I notice that there are rule blocks scattered around. Maybe I can move some of them to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, they might no longer block me. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba able to pass through walls by changing the rules.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is active, which means walls block movement. If I can break that rule, walls won't stop me anymore. To do that, I need to move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" part of the rule. Let me see where those rule blocks are. There's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step up, and a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, making walls passable.

But how do I get to those rule blocks? They're surrounded by walls. Maybe I can move some other rule blocks first to create a path. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba able to jump or something, but I don't see any rule blocks that would allow that.

Another idea: if I can make the key into something else, like a passable object, I might be able to reach it. But the key is already the win condition, so maybe I just need to get to it.

Let me plan my movements. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move right to get closer to the key. But there are walls in the way. If I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can walk through them. So, I need to move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" rule block.

Looking at the rule blocks, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that, the walls won't stop me. But to get to the ""stop"" rule, I need to move right and up. Let me try moving right first.

I'll start by moving right. Each step right brings me closer to the rule blocks. Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, I can walk through the walls to reach the key.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So, I need to plan each move carefully. Let me outline the steps:

1. Move right to get closer to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Once adjacent, move up to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move it to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Now, walls are passable, so I can move through them to reach the key.

But I have to make sure I don't get stuck. Let me visualize the map. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. There are walls in the way, but if I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can go straight to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make something else the win condition, but that might complicate things. It's probably better to focus on making the walls passable.

So, my first move should be to the right to start approaching the rule blocks. That way, I can eventually break the wall rule and reach the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. My goal is to get to the key to win. But there are walls in the way, so I need to figure out how to move around them or change the rules to make it easier.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules that help me. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me anymore. But how do I do that?

I see a ""wall"" rule block 2 steps to the left and another ""stop"" rule block 1 step to the right. If I can move the ""stop"" block next to the ""wall"" block, I can form ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Wait, maybe I can break that rule by moving one of them away. If I move the ""stop"" block somewhere else, then ""wall is stop"" would no longer be active, making walls passable.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, but I'm not sure if that helps. Or maybe ""key is you,"" which would let me win by being the key, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Let me think about the positions. The key is 7 right, 1 down. I'm starting at the origin, I think. So to get to the key, I need to move right 7 times and down once. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions.

There are walls at 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; 3 right, 2 down; 3 right, 3 down; 3 right, 4 down; and 3 right, 5 down. So there's a vertical line of walls at 3 right, from 1 up to 5 down. That's a big barrier.

But I can move around them if I can go above or below. Let me see if there's a path. If I go up first, maybe I can bypass the walls. But I need to check if there are walls above. The rule blocks are at various positions, but I don't see walls above the initial position except for 3 right, 1 up. So maybe I can go up, move right, and then down.

Wait, but the walls are at 3 right, so if I go up, move right past 3, then down, I might be able to get around. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall"" block, then walls won't stop me. Let me see where the ""stop"" block is. It's 1 step to the right. So if I move it somewhere else, like down or left, then ""wall is stop"" would no longer be active.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects. So maybe I can move right to where the ""stop"" block is and push it down or left.

Wait, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the right. So if I move right once, I can push it. Let me plan that. Move right, then push it down. That would make the ""stop"" block move down, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls wouldn't block me anymore, and I could walk through them.

But I need to make sure that after moving the ""stop"" block, I can still reach the key. Let me visualize the map. If I move right to the ""stop"" block, push it down, then I can go around the walls. But I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to another word. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might let me win. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key, and since ""key is win,"" that would mean I am win. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Let me think about the positions of the rule blocks. The ""is"" block is at 1 step left and 1 step up. The ""key"" block is at 6 right, 1 up. The ""win"" block is at 8 right, 1 up. The ""wall"" block is at 2 left. The ""stop"" block is at 1 right.

If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I can create new rules. But I'm not sure how to do that without getting stuck.

Maybe the best approach is to move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall"" block to make walls passable. Let me try that. I'll move right to the ""stop"" block, then push it down. That should break the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing me to walk through walls.

Once the walls are passable, I can move right past them to reach the key. So my plan is: move right to the ""stop"" block, push it down, then move right through the walls to get to the key.

But I need to make sure I can push the ""stop"" block. Since I'm Baba, I can push it if I'm adjacent. So I'll move right once to be next to it, then push it down. That should work.

After pushing it down, I can move right past the walls. Let me count the steps. From the starting position, move right once to be next to ""stop,"" push it down, then move right again past the walls. Then move down once to reach the key.

Wait, the key is at 7 right, 1 down. So after moving right past the walls, I need to move down once. Let me make sure I can do that without hitting any walls.

I think this plan should work. So the actions I need to take are: right, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, down.

Wait, but I need to push the ""stop"" block first. So the sequence would be: right (to reach ""stop""), down (to push it down), then right multiple times to get past the walls, then down to the key.

But I'm not sure if I can push the ""stop"" block down without any issues. Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" block to the left instead of down. That might also break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let me see.

If I move left from the starting position, I can reach the ""wall"" rule block at 2 left. But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's better to move the ""stop"" block down.

I think the best course of action is to move right to the ""stop"" block, push it down, then move right past the walls and down to the key.

So the actions would be: right, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, down.

But I need to make sure I can do this without getting stuck. Let me visualize each step.

1. Start at position (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0), next to ""stop"" at (1,0).
3. Push ""stop"" down to (1,-1).
4. Now, ""wall is stop"" is broken, so walls are passable.
5. Move right to (2,0), then right to (3,0), which is a wall, but now passable.
6. Continue moving right past the walls to (7,0).
7. Move down to (7,-1) to reach the key.

Yes, that should work. So the actions are: right, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, down.

But I need to output just one action at a time. So the first action is ""right.""

So, the first move should be to the right to start moving towards the ""stop"" rule. That way, I can begin the process of changing the rules to make the walls passable.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. My goal is to get to the key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

First, I should check where the walls are. There's a wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up, another 1 step to the right and 1 step down, and more walls extending down from there. So, moving directly right might be blocked. 

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""rule `is`"" 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, and another ""rule `is`"" 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move these to create new rules or change existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I might be able to change the win condition or make the key do something else.

But wait, the key is already the win condition. Maybe I need to make myself (Baba) able to move through walls or something. The current rules don't have anything about Baba being able to move through walls. So perhaps I can create a new rule like ""baba is pass"" or something similar if there's a ""pass"" rule block available. 

Looking again, I don't see a ""pass"" rule block mentioned. Hmm. Maybe I can break apart the existing rules. If I move the ""key"" rule block away from ""win,"" that might change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. There's a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the right. If I can move that, perhaps I can make walls not stop me. For example, if I create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" that would allow me to move through walls. 

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block next to ""wall"" and ""is."" But the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right, and the ""wall"" rule is 4 steps to the left. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to connect them.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I move that closer to the ""stop"" and ""wall"" rules, I might be able to form a new rule. But moving rule blocks requires me to be adjacent to them, right? So I need to get Baba next to the ""is"" rule block.

Baba is currently where? The active rules say ""baba is you,"" so I'm at the starting position. I need to move right to get closer to the key. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move up or down to find a path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up, and another 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So moving straight right is blocked. Maybe I can move up first, then right, then down. Let me see:

- Move up: Is there space? The wall is 1 step up and right, so if I move up, I might be able to go around. Wait, no, because the wall is directly up and right. Maybe I can move left first, but that would take me away from the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first. The wall is 1 step down and right, so moving down might allow me to go around. Let me try:

1. Move down: That would take me to the position below Baba. Is there a wall there? The wall is 1 step to the right and 1 step down, so moving down would take me to the same level as the wall. Maybe I can move right from there.

2. After moving down, I can try moving right. But the wall is blocking that path. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to get to the ""is"" rule block. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. So moving left three times and up once would get me there. But that seems like a long way, and I'm not sure if it's necessary.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule block next to ""key"" and ""win."" If I can form ""key is win,"" that's already the active rule. Maybe I can make ""key is you"" to make the key controllable, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might allow me to interact with the win condition differently. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key and see if there's a way to bypass the walls. Let me try moving right as much as possible.

Wait, the key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. So if I can move right 5 times and down once, I can reach it. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can find a path that goes around the walls.

Looking at the walls, they are placed in a vertical line from 1 step right and 1 step up down to 1 step right and 5 steps down. So the rightmost column is blocked. Maybe I can move up or down to find a gap.

Wait, the ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe the ball can help, but I'm not sure how. Balls in Baba Is You usually follow physics, but without gravity rules, they might not move.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I can make the walls not stop me, I can walk through them. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""wall is not stop."" 

To create that rule, I need to have the ""wall"" rule block, the ""is"" rule block, and the ""not stop"" rule block adjacent in the correct order. But I don't see a ""not"" rule block mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving one of the blocks. If I move the ""stop"" rule block away from ""wall"" and ""is,"" the rule would be broken, and walls would no longer stop me. 

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I can move it somewhere else, like down or up, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. Let me try that.

To move the ""stop"" rule block, I need to be adjacent to it. It's 1 step to the right, so I can move right once to reach it. But moving right is blocked by a wall. So I can't get to it directly.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another way. Perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule block to connect ""wall"" and ""stop"" in a different way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. If I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the key is already the win condition. If I can reach it, I win. So maybe I just need to find a way to get past the walls.

Let me try moving up first. If I move up, I can avoid the wall that's blocking the right path. Then, I can move right and down to reach the key.

So, step by step:

1. Move up: From my current position, moving up would take me to a position where there's a wall 1 step up and right. Wait, no, the wall is 1 step right and 1 step up, so moving up would take me to the same level as the wall. Maybe I can move up and then right.

2. Move up: Now I'm at (0,1). The wall is at (1,1), so I can't move right from here. Maybe I can move left first, but that's away from the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first. Let's try:

1. Move down: Now I'm at (0,-1). The wall is at (1,-1), so I can't move right from here either.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to create a new rule to make the walls passable. Let me think about how to do that.

I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I can move either the ""wall,"" ""is,"" or ""stop"" rule block so that they're no longer adjacent in the correct order.

The ""wall"" rule is 4 steps to the left. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. So they're not all adjacent. Wait, maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the ""wall"" rule block, ""is"" rule block, and ""stop"" rule block being in a line. If I can move one of them, the rule would break.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule block away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" rule blocks, the ""wall is stop"" rule would no longer be active. Then, walls wouldn't stop me, and I could walk through them.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule block? It's 1 step to the right, which is blocked by a wall. I can't reach it directly. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to connect to ""stop"" and ""wall"" in a different way.

Wait, the ""is"" rule block is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move it to be next to ""stop"" and ""wall,"" I might be able to form a new rule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. If I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the key is already the win condition. If I can reach it, I win. So maybe I just need to find a way to get past the walls.

Let me try moving right as much as possible, even if it's blocked. Maybe I can find a way around.

Wait, the walls are in a vertical line from (1,1) down to (1,5). So the rightmost column is blocked. Maybe I can move up or down to find a gap.

Looking at the map, the ball is at (2,4). Maybe I can use the ball to break a wall or something, but I don't see a rule that allows that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule block to change my properties. The ""baba"" rule is 4 steps to the left and 5 steps down. If I can move it to connect with ""is"" and something else, I might be able to change what Baba is.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, the key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move down first, then right, maybe I can bypass the walls. Let me try:

1. Move down: Now I'm at (0,-1). The wall is at (1,-1), so I can't move right from here.

Hmm, same problem. Maybe I need to move left first to get around.

Wait, moving left would take me away from the key. That's not helpful.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to create a new rule to make the walls passable. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule block.

But I can't reach it because it's blocked by a wall. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to connect ""wall"" and ""stop"" in a different way.

Wait, the ""is"" rule block is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move it to be next to ""stop"" and ""wall,"" I might be able to form a new rule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. If I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to connect ""key"" and ""win"" in a different way. If I can make ""key is win"" into something else, maybe I can change the win condition to something easier to reach.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm overcomplicating things. Maybe I just need to find a way to get past the walls.

Let me try moving up first, then right, then down. Let's see:

1. Move up: Now I'm at (0,1). The wall is at (1,1), so I can't move right from here.

Hmm, same problem. Maybe I can move up again to get higher and then move right.

2. Move up again: Now I'm at (0,2). The wall is still at (1,1), so moving right from here would take me to (1,2), which is not blocked. Wait, is (1,2) blocked? Let me check the objects.

Looking back, the walls are at (1,1), (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3), (1,-4), (1,-5). So (1,2) is not blocked. So from (0,2), I can move right to (1,2), then down to (1,1), but that's blocked. Wait, no, (1,1) is blocked, but (1,2) is not.

Wait, maybe I can move right to (1,2), then down to (1,1), but (1,1) is a wall. So I can't go there. Hmm.

Alternatively, from (1,2), I can move right again to (2,2), but I don't see any walls there. Let me check the objects again.

The key is at (5,-1). So from (2,2), I can move right three more times to reach (5,2), then down to (5,-1). But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Looking at the walls, they are all along the x=1 line. So from x=2 onwards, there are no walls. So that path is clear.

So the plan is:

1. Move up twice to (0,2).
2. Move right to (1,2).
3. Move right to (2,2).
4. Move right to (3,2).
5. Move right to (4,2).
6. Move right to (5,2).
7. Move down to (5,1).
8. Move down to (5,0).
9. Move down to (5,-1) to reach the key.

Wait, but moving from (5,2) down to (5,1), (5,0), and (5,-1) should be possible since there are no walls in the x=5 column. So this seems like a viable path.

But wait, the ball is at (2,4). Does that affect anything? I don't think so, since there's no rule involving the ball.

So, to execute this plan, I need to move up twice, then right five times, then down three times. But the initial move up is blocked by the wall at (1,1). Wait, no, when I'm at (0,1), moving right would take me to (1,1), which is blocked. So I can't move right from (0,1).

Ah, right. So I need to find another way. Maybe I can move up, then right, then up again to bypass the wall.

Wait, let me try:

1. Move up to (0,1). Can't move right because of the wall.
2. Move up again to (0,2). Now, from (0,2), I can move right to (1,2), which is not blocked.

Yes, that works. So the steps are:

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Move up again to (0,2).
3. Move right to (1,2).
4. Move right to (2,2).
5. Move right to (3,2).
6. Move right to (4,2).
7. Move right to (5,2).
8. Move down to (5,1).
9. Move down to (5,0).
10. Move down to (5,-1) to reach the key.

This should work because the walls are only along x=1, and from x=2 onwards, there are no walls blocking the way. So I can safely move right and then down to reach the key.

So the first move is to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. My goal is to get to the key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

First, I should check where the walls are. There's a wall 1 step to the right, another 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, and more walls further down. So, moving directly right might be blocked. 

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""rule `is`"" 3 steps to the left, which might be useful if I can move it. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to change how the game works. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could become the key and win that way. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me try to move right first. If I go right once, I'll be at the position of the wall. Oh, but walls are stop, so I can't move into them. That means I can't go right from my starting position because there's a wall blocking me.

Hmm, maybe I should move down first. If I go down, I can avoid the wall to the right. Let me see: moving down once would take me to a position where I can then move right. But I need to check if that path is clear. 

Wait, there's a wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So if I move down twice, I'll hit that wall. Maybe I should move down once, then right, and then up or down again. Let me visualize this.

Starting position: let's say I'm at (0,0). The wall is at (1,0). So moving right is blocked. If I move down to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1), but there's a wall at (1,-2). So moving down once, then right, then down again would hit the wall. That's not good.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left. There's a ""rule `is`"" 3 steps to the left. If I move left three times, I can pick up that rule block. But I'm not sure if that helps me immediately. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule somewhere else to create a new rule.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I could create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, thus winning the game. That sounds promising.

So, how do I get to the ""is"" rule? It's 3 steps to the left. I can move left three times to reach it. Once I'm there, I can pick it up and move it next to ""baba"" and ""key."" But I need to make sure I can move without being blocked.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move left three times to get to the ""is"" rule block.
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move right to position it between ""baba"" and ""key.""
4. Now, the rule ""baba is key"" is active, making me the key, which is the win condition.

But wait, can I move the ""is"" block while holding it? I think in Baba Is You, you can carry rule blocks and place them to create new rules. So yes, this should work.

So, the first step is to move left three times. Let me check if that's possible. There are no walls blocking me to the left, so moving left three times should be straightforward.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move right towards the ""baba"" and ""key"" blocks. Placing the ""is"" between them would create the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block to where I am, but that might be more complicated. Moving the ""is"" seems simpler.

Another thought: if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, and I can win by being the key. But the current rule is ""key is win,"" so maybe making ""baba is key"" is better.

I think the best approach is to move left to get the ""is"" rule, then position it to create ""baba is key."" That should let me win by being the key.

So, the first action is to move left three times. But since the assistant can only choose one action at a time, I'll start with moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. My goal is to get to the key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

First, I should check where the walls are. There are walls at various positions: 2 steps to the right, 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down, 3 steps down, 4 steps down, 5 steps down, and 6 steps down. So, the path to the key might be blocked by walls. 

I also notice there are some rule blocks scattered around. Maybe I can move them to change the rules and make the walls passable or remove them. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me anymore. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block next to ""wall"" and ""is.""

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block (which is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down) next to ""stop,"" I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. But since ""key is win"" is already active, I might not need to do that. 

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me see the path to the key. The key is 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So, I need to move right 6 times and down 2 times. But are there walls in the way? 

At 2 steps to the right, there's a wall. So, moving right from my starting position, I'll hit a wall immediately. That's a problem. I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. 

So, I need to change the rule so that walls are not stop. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block next to ""wall"" and ""is."" The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to be next to ""stop,"" I can create ""wall is stop"" or change it. Wait, but ""wall is stop"" is already active. Maybe I need to break that rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""not,"" I can make ""wall is not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" rule block here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block away from the wall. If I move ""stop"" somewhere else, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, and walls wouldn't block me anymore. 

So, how can I move the ""stop"" rule block? It's 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. I need to move it somewhere else. Maybe I can move it next to another rule block to create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule block to change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. I need to get to the key, which is 6 right and 2 down. But the first wall is at 2 right. So, I need to either move the wall or change the rule.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule block, I can make walls passable. Let's try that. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 1 down. If I move it to another location, say, next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is stop,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, moving it next to ""key"" could change the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to the left, so it's not associated with ""wall."" That way, ""wall is stop"" would no longer be active, and I can walk through walls.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block from 2 right, 1 down to somewhere else. Let's say I move it to the left. But how? I need to move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move ""wall"" away from ""is"" and ""stop,"" the rule would be broken.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left, 6 down, among others. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule next to a different ""is"" to create a new rule.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule block first. Let's see, if I move ""stop"" to the left, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

So, I need to move ""stop"" from 2 right, 1 down to, say, 1 right, 1 down. That would require moving it left once. But can I do that? I'm Baba, so I can move around, but I can only move rule blocks that are not ""stop."" Wait, no, I can move any rule blocks unless they're defined as stop. Since ""stop"" is a rule, I can move it.

Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as stop. So, if ""wall is stop,"" then walls can't be moved. But rule blocks like ""stop"" can be moved because they're not walls. So, I can move the ""stop"" rule block.

So, I'll move the ""stop"" rule block from 2 right, 1 down to 1 right, 1 down. That would break the ""wall is stop"" rule because ""stop"" is no longer next to ""wall."" Now, walls won't block me anymore.

Once I've done that, I can move right past the walls to reach the key. So, my plan is:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule block left once to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Move right past the walls to reach the key.

But wait, how do I move the ""stop"" rule block? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. So, I need to move Baba to the position next to ""stop,"" which is at 2 right, 1 down. 

So, first, I need to move down once to get to 0 right, 1 down. Then, move right twice to get to 2 right, 1 down, which is where ""stop"" is. Then, I can move ""stop"" left to 1 right, 1 down.

After that, the walls are no longer stop, so I can move right past them. Then, I can move right 6 times and down 2 times to reach the key.

Wait, but moving ""stop"" might take a few steps. Let me outline the exact moves:

1. Move down once to 0 right, 1 down.
2. Move right twice to 2 right, 1 down (where ""stop"" is).
3. Move ""stop"" left to 1 right, 1 down.
4. Now, walls are passable. Move right past the wall at 2 right.
5. Continue moving right to 6 right and down to 2 down to reach the key.

But I need to make sure that after moving ""stop,"" the walls are indeed passable. Let me double-check. If ""wall is stop"" is broken, then walls are just normal objects and can be walked through.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the key steps are moving the ""stop"" rule block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then moving to the key.

I think that's the solution. So, the first action I need to take is moving down to get to the position where I can move the ""stop"" rule block.

I see a ""wall"" rule block 3 steps to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can combine it with another rule. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule block 2 steps to the right. If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""stop,"" I could create ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Hmm, maybe I need to break that rule instead.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall,"" maybe I can make ""wall is not stop."" But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would let me become the key, but that might not help directly.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would become me, but I'm not sure if that's useful. Or maybe ""key is win"" is already set, so I just need to reach it.

Looking at the ball, it's 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure how. 

I think the best approach is to try to move towards the key. Since the key is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down, I need to navigate around the walls. Let me check the path: starting from my position, moving right 6 steps and down 1 step. Are there walls blocking that path?

From the map, there are walls at 2 steps right and 1 step up, 2 steps right, 2 steps right and 1 down, etc. So moving right might be blocked. Maybe I can go up first to avoid the walls. 

If I move up, I can see a ""rule `is`"" block 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. If I move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I could change the rule. For example, moving ""wall"" next to ""stop"" could make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Maybe I need to break that rule by moving one of them.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule block closer. The ""key"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that next to ""win,"" I could create ""key is win,"" which is already active. Maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key."" If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""key,"" that might let me become the key, but I'm not sure how that helps me win.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key step by step, seeing if I can find a path. Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I might hit a wall. So maybe I should move up first to go around.

Let me try moving up. That would take me to where the ""rule `is`"" block is. If I can move that block, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" could change the rule to ""wall is not stop,"" which would make walls passable.

So, my plan is: move up to get to the ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to create ""wall is not stop."" Once walls are passable, I can move right towards the key.

But wait, how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. So first, I need to get next to it. Let me see: the ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. So from my current position, I need to move left twice and up once to reach it.

Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can move it to a new position. Maybe I can move it next to the ""wall"" rule, which is 3 steps to the left. So after moving the ""is"" rule, I can create ""wall is not stop.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right. If I move it somewhere else, the wall might no longer be stop.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe creating ""wall is not stop"" is better because it changes the rule globally.

So, to summarize, I need to:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is not stop.""
3. Once walls are passable, move right towards the key.

Let me try that. First, I'll move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

But to move it, I need to be able to reach it. Right now, it's 2 steps to the right and 1 step down from my position. Are there any walls blocking me from getting there?

Looking at the walls, there's one 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, another 2 steps to the right, and others below. So the path to the ""stop"" rule might be blocked. Maybe I can move around the walls or find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule block. There are multiple ""is"" blocks, so perhaps I can rearrange them to form a new rule. For example, moving an ""is"" next to ""win"" could change the win condition.

Wait, the key is already the win condition, so maybe I don't need to change that. Let me focus on making walls passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule.

So, I need to get to the ""stop"" rule block. It's 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Let me plan my path. I'm currently at the starting position, which I'll consider as (0,0). The ""stop"" rule is at (2, -1). Are there any walls in the way?

Looking at the walls, there's one at (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3), (2,-4), (2,-5), and (2,-6). So the path to (2,-1) is blocked by a wall at (2,0) and (2,-1). Hmm, that's a problem. I can't move through walls unless I change the rules, which I can't do yet because I can't reach the rule blocks.

Maybe I need to find another approach. Let me look for other rule blocks I can access. There's a ""key"" rule at (5,1), ""is"" at (6,1), ""win"" at (7,1), and ""wall"" at (-3,1). If I can move the ""wall"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at (-3,1). If I can move it next to ""stop,"" which is at (2,-1), I could create ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Maybe I need to break that rule by moving ""stop"" away.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another idea: if I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball can move and maybe reach the key. But I don't see a ""ball"" rule block nearby.

Wait, the ball is at (3,-4). Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is you."" But I can't reach the ""is"" rule because it's blocked by walls.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""wall is not stop."" But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule.

Let me try to plan my movements. I need to get to the ""stop"" rule at (2,-1). But the path is blocked. Maybe I can go around. Let me see the layout:

- Starting position: (0,0)
- Walls: (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3), (2,-4), (2,-5), (2,-6)
- ""stop"" rule: (2,-1)
- ""wall"" rule: (-3,1)
- ""key"" rule: (5,1)
- ""is"" rules: (6,1), (7,1), etc.

Hmm, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. If I go up, I can reach (0,1). From there, I can move right to (1,1), (2,1) is a wall, so I can't go further right. Maybe I can move left instead.

Wait, moving left from (0,0) would take me to (-1,0), but I don't see any walls there. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule `is`"" at (-2,1), ""rule `wall`"" at (-3,1), and others. So moving left might help me reach the ""wall"" rule.

If I move left twice, I'll be at (-2,0). From there, I can move up to (-2,1) where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can only move one step at a time. Let me plan step by step:

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. Move left again to (-2,0).
3. Move up to (-2,1) where the ""is"" rule is.
4. Now, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it somewhere else.

But I'm not sure if I can carry rule blocks. In Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks by moving into them, which allows you to carry them. So, after moving to (-2,1), I can move the ""is"" rule by moving in a direction, which would carry it.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the right. So from (-2,1), moving right would take the ""is"" rule to (-1,1). Now, the rule is ""is"" at (-1,1). 

Next, I can move the ""is"" rule further right to (0,1). Now, ""is"" is at (0,1). 

Then, I can move the ""is"" rule to (1,1). Now, ""is"" is at (1,1). 

From there, I can move the ""is"" rule to (2,1), but that's a wall. So I can't do that. Alternatively, I can move it down to (1,0). 

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by placing ""is"" next to another rule. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""wall,"" I can make ""wall is something.""

But the ""wall"" rule is at (-3,1). So I need to move the ""is"" rule there. Let me try:

From (1,1), move left to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), then left to (-2,1), and then left to (-3,1). Now, the ""is"" rule is at (-3,1), next to the ""wall"" rule. So the rule becomes ""wall is [something]."" But what's next to it? If I move the ""is"" rule to (-3,1), and there's nothing else, maybe I can create ""wall is stop"" again, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. But the ""stop"" rule is at (2,-1), which is blocked by walls. I can't reach it yet.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""key."" The ""key"" rule is at (5,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can make ""key is something.""

But moving the ""is"" rule from (-3,1) to (5,1) would require moving right multiple times, but I can't pass through walls. So that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the ball. The ball is at (3,-4). If I can make the ball into something useful, like ""ball is you,"" then the ball can move and maybe reach the key.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball."" The ""ball"" is at (3,-4), so I need to get the ""is"" rule there. But again, the path is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, thus winning the level. But how?

The ""key"" rule is at (5,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and then next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is key."" But I'm not sure how to do that without moving through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba."" The ""key"" rule is at (5,1), and ""baba"" is at (0,0). To move the ""key"" rule, I need to reach it, but it's blocked by walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a way to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule, then walls won't stop me anymore.

But the ""stop"" rule is at (2,-1), which is blocked by walls. I can't reach it unless I can move through walls, which I can't do yet.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, ""wall is not stop."" To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule.

But again, I can't reach the ""stop"" rule because it's blocked. Maybe I need to find another way to break the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""baba is not you,"" but that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball can move and maybe reach the key. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball.""

The ""ball"" is at (3,-4). So I need to get the ""is"" rule there. Let me see if I can move the ""is"" rule down.

From (-3,1), I can move down to (-3,0), then to (-3,-1), etc., but I don't see any walls blocking that path. So maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to (-3,-4), next to the ""ball.""

Wait, the ""ball"" is at (3,-4), so I need to move the ""is"" rule to (3,-4). But that's a long way. Let me plan:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from (-3,1) down to (-3,0), (-3,-1), (-3,-2), (-3,-3), (-3,-4).
2. Then, move right to (-2,-4), (-1,-4), (0,-4), (1,-4), (2,-4), (3,-4).

Now, the ""is"" rule is at (3,-4), next to the ""ball."" So the rule becomes ""ball is [something]."" But I need to have another rule block next to it to complete the rule. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule there.

The ""you"" rule is at (1,-6). So I need to move the ""you"" rule up to (3,-4). But that's a long path, and I'm not sure if it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create ""ball is you"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and then moving the ""you"" rule next to it. But this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""ball,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that helps.

The ""win"" rule is at (7,1). So I need to move it down to (7,-4), next to the ""ball."" But that's a long way, and I can't pass through walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me think about the initial setup again.

The key is at (6,-2). I need to get there. The path is blocked by walls at (2,0), (2,-1), etc. Maybe I can move the walls somehow. But walls are ""stop,"" so I can't move them unless I change the rule.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can move through them. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at (-3,1), and the ""stop"" rule is at (2,-1). If I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, like next to another rule, then ""wall is stop"" would be broken.

But I can't reach the ""stop"" rule because it's blocked by walls. So I'm stuck.

Maybe I need to find another way to win. The key is the win condition, but maybe I can make something else the win condition. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I win by being myself.

But how? The ""win"" rule is at (7,1). I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win."" But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because it's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""ball,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. But again, I can't reach the ""win"" rule.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for a different rule combination. Let me see the available rule blocks:

- ""is"" at (-2,1), (6,1), (7,1), etc.
- ""key"" at (5,1)
- ""win"" at (7,1)
- ""wall"" at (-3,1)
- ""stop"" at (2,-1)
- ""baba"" at (0,0)
- ""you"" at (1,-6)

I think the best approach is to try to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" rule away. But since I can't reach it, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is not stop,"" then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to ""baba."" But ""baba"" is at (0,0), and ""stop"" is at (2,-1). I can't reach ""stop"" to move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""not stop."" But I don't have a ""not"" rule block.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without reaching the key. For example, making ""baba is win"" would let me win immediately.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win."" But ""win"" is at (7,1), which is blocked. So I can't do that.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" If I can move the ""win"" rule to (0,0), then ""baba is win"" would be active. But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because it's blocked.

This is really frustrating. I'm stuck because I can't reach the necessary rule blocks to change the rules. Maybe I need to find a different way to move the rule blocks.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. If I can make the ball move, it might help. The ball is at (3,-4). If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and maybe reach the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and then next to ""you."" But ""you"" is at (1,-6), which is far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""ball."" But again, the path is blocked.

I'm stuck. I think the only way to proceed is to try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to break through the walls. Maybe ""wall is not stop.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule. Since I can't reach the ""stop"" rule, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule away from the ""stop"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at (-3,1), and the ""stop"" rule is at (2,-1). If I can move the ""wall"" rule somewhere else, then ""wall is stop"" would be broken.

But I can't reach the ""wall"" rule because it's at (-3,1), which is blocked by walls on the right. Wait, no, the walls are on the right side, so maybe I can move left to reach it.

Let me try:

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. Move left again to (-2,0).
3. Move up to (-2,1) where the ""is"" rule is.
4. Now, I can move the ""is"" rule to (-3,1) where the ""wall"" rule is","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. There are also walls and some rule blocks. The walls are stopping me from moving through them, so I need to figure out how to get around them or change the rules to make them passable.

I notice that there are rule blocks scattered around. Maybe I can move some of them to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, they might no longer block me. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba able to pass through walls by changing the rules.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is active, which means walls block movement. If I can break that rule, walls won't stop me anymore. To do that, I need to move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" part of the rule. Let me see where those rule blocks are. There's a ""wall"" rule 3 steps to the left and 1 step down, and a ""stop"" rule 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, making walls passable.

But how do I get to those rule blocks? I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. I need to move towards the rule blocks. Let me plan my path. I can move right a few steps to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Once I'm next to it, I can move it somewhere else, like up or down, to break the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass"" or something like that, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition. But the current win condition is ""key is win,"" so I need the key to win. Maybe I can make the ball the win condition instead, but that might complicate things.

Let me focus on the walls. If I can make walls not stop me, I can move through them to reach the key. So, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" part of the rule. Let's say I move the ""stop"" rule. I can move it to a different location, which would break the rule, making walls passable.

So, my plan is to move towards the ""stop"" rule, pick it up, and move it somewhere else. Let me see the exact position. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, from my current position, I need to move right twice and down once to reach it.

Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule, I can move it, say, up or down, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. After that, walls won't block me anymore, and I can move through them to reach the key.

But wait, I also need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't create any unintended consequences. For example, if I move it next to another rule, it might create a new rule that's not helpful. So, I should move it to a place where it doesn't form a new rule.

Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" part of the rule. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I move that, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken as well.

Either way, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule seems like the key to solving this puzzle. Once walls are passable, I can navigate to the key and win the level.

So, to summarize, I need to move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" rule to break the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing me to pass through walls and reach the key. Let's choose to move the ""stop"" rule since it's closer. I'll move right twice and down once to get to it, then move it somewhere safe.

Now, let me execute this step by step. First, move right to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Then, move down to reach it. Once there, I'll move it up or down to break the rule. After that, I can move through the walls to reach the key and win the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. My goal is to get to the key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I see walls at various positions, especially to the right and down. I also notice there are some rule blocks like ""is,"" ""key,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to change the rules, which might help me reach the key.

Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. I need to check if there's a clear path to the key. Let me visualize the map. The key is at (5, -2) relative to my starting position. There are walls at (1, -2), (1, -3), (1, -4), (1, -5), and (1, -6). So, moving directly right might be blocked by walls.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, meaning walls block movement. So I can't just walk through them. I need to find a way around or change the rules to make walls passable.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""rule `stop`"" at (1, -1). If I can move that, maybe I can change what stops movement. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me anymore. But how do I do that?

I need to move the ""stop"" rule block next to a wall or another subject. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's at (1, -1). If I can move it to be next to ""wall,"" I can create a new rule like ""wall is not stop."" But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" that would change the rule. But I need to plan the steps carefully.

Let me think about the sequence. I need to move the ""stop"" rule block to a position where it can form a new rule with ""wall."" Maybe I can move it down to where the walls are. But I have to make sure I can reach it.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. The ""stop"" rule is at (1, -1). If I move right once, I can reach it. But is that possible? Let me check the walls. There's a wall at (1, 0), so moving right from my position (0,0) to (1,0) is blocked. Hmm, that's a problem.

Maybe I can move up or down first to get around. If I move up, there's a wall at (0,1), so that's blocked. Moving down, I can go to (0,-1), which is clear. From there, I can move right to (1,-1) where the ""stop"" rule is. That seems possible.

So the plan is: move down to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1) to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to a position where it can form a new rule with ""wall."" For example, moving it to (1,-2) where there's a wall. That would create ""wall is stop"" again, which doesn't help. Maybe I need to move it further.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to the left of ""wall."" The ""wall"" rule is at (4,0). If I move ""stop"" to (3,0), then ""wall is stop"" would still be the rule. That doesn't help. Maybe I need to create a new rule like ""wall is not stop.""

To do that, I need to have ""wall"" followed by ""is"" and ""not stop."" So I need to move the ""is"" rule and ""not stop"" into position. But I don't see a ""not"" block, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving one of the components.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule away from ""wall,"" the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, and ""wall"" would no longer be stop. That might be a way to make walls passable.

So, moving the ""stop"" rule block away from ""wall"" would change the active rules. Let me try that. I'll move down to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it further down to (1,-2), which is a wall. But that would place ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" recreating the same rule. Not helpful.

Maybe I should move it to the left. From (1,-1), moving left to (0,-1) would place ""stop"" next to nothing, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. That could work. Let me try that.

So, the steps would be: down to (0,-1), right to (1,-1) to pick up ""stop,"" then left to (0,-1) to place it there. Now, the ""stop"" rule is no longer next to ""wall,"" so ""wall is stop"" is no longer active. That means walls are no longer stop blocks, and I can walk through them.

Once walls are passable, I can move right through them to reach the key. So, after making walls passable, I can move right, up or down as needed to get to the key at (5,-2).

Wait, but I need to make sure that after moving ""stop,"" the rule ""wall is stop"" is indeed removed. Let me confirm. If ""stop"" is moved away, then the rule is broken, and walls are no longer stop. That should allow me to move through walls.

So, the plan is:

1. Move down to (0,-1).
2. Move right to (1,-1) to pick up ""stop.""
3. Move left to (0,-1) to place ""stop"" there, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Now, walls are passable. Move right through the walls to reach the key.

Let me check if there are any other obstacles. The key is at (5,-2). After making walls passable, I can move right past the walls at (1,0), (1,-1), etc., and proceed to the key.

I think this should work. So, the first step is to move down.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. There are also walls and some rule blocks. The walls are stopping me from moving through them, so I need to figure out how to get to the key.

I notice that the key is to the right and a bit down. There are walls blocking the way, but maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make the walls passable. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is currently at 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. But how? I need to get close enough to move the rule blocks. 

Let me plan my movements. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move right to get closer to the key. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move up or down to find a path. 

Looking at the map, there's a ball 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down. I'm not sure if that's relevant, but maybe it can be used somehow. 

I think the key is to manipulate the rules so that I can move through the walls. If I can make the walls not stop me, I can reach the key. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. 

To do that, I need to get next to it. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. So, I should move right once. But wait, there's a wall in the way. Hmm, maybe I can move up or down to bypass the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is 4 steps to the left. If I can move that, perhaps I can redefine what a wall is. But I'm not sure how that would help immediately. 

Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I might hit a wall. But if I can move up or down, maybe I can find a way around. 

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to change the win condition, but I'm not sure. 

I think the best approach is to move right to get closer to the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there. So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. There are also several walls and text blocks. The walls are at various positions, some up and down, which might block my path. The ball is at 1 step right and 4 steps down, which might be a distraction or part of the solution.

I need to get to the key to win. But how? Let me check the text blocks. There's a rule ""wall is stop,"" which means walls can't be moved through. So I need to find a path around or through them.

The key is at (4 right, 1 down). Let me visualize the map. Starting from my position, which I assume is where Baba is. The walls are at 1 step up, 1 step down, 2 steps down, 3 steps down, 4 steps down, and 5 steps down. That seems like a vertical line of walls on the right side. 

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, so I can't move through walls. I need to find a way to move the walls or change the rules to make them passable. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls passable. How can I do that? I can move the ""stop"" text block to a different location, which would change the rule for walls.

Alternatively, I could try to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""is"" or ""stop"" blocks. For example, if I move the ""is"" block away from ""wall,"" the rule would be broken, and walls wouldn't stop me anymore.

Let me see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one 4 steps to the left and 5 steps down, and another 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I can move one of these to break the rule.

But wait, I'm Baba, and I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""stop."" Since ""wall is stop"" is active, I can't move walls, but I can move the text blocks. So I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" blocks.

If I move the ""stop"" block from 1 step right to somewhere else, the rule ""wall is stop"" would change. For example, if I move ""stop"" to a different location, the rule might become ""wall is [something else]"" or break entirely, making walls passable.

Alternatively, I could move the ""is"" block from ""wall is stop"" to break the rule. Let's say I move the ""is"" block that's part of ""wall is stop"" to another location. That would remove the ""is"" from the rule, making walls not stop anymore.

But how do I get to those text blocks? The ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the right. If I move right once, I can reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like down or left, to break the rule.

Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, I can move through the walls. Then, I can go to the key at 4 right, 1 down.

So the plan is: move right to get to the ""stop"" block, then move it away to break the rule, allowing me to pass through walls. Then, move to the key to win.

Let me check the steps. From my current position, I need to move right once to reach the ""stop"" block. Then, I can move it down or left. Let's say I move it down. That would change the rule, making walls passable.

After that, I can move right four times and down once to reach the key. But wait, there are walls in the way. If the rule is broken, I can move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block instead. The ""is"" block is at 4 left and 5 down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can get there after breaking another rule.

Hmm, perhaps the quickest way is to move the ""stop"" block. Let me try that.

So, first action: move right to reach the ""stop"" block. Then, move it down to break the rule. After that, move through the walls to the key.

But wait, in the current observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the right. So moving right once would get me there. Then, moving it down would change the rule.

Yes, that seems feasible. So the first step is to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, I need to figure out how to move there. 

Wait, the walls are in the way. There's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, and another wall at 1 step to the left. Also, there's a rule `stop` at 1 step to the right. Hmm, that might block me if I try to move right. 

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to somewhere else so I can pass. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's at 1 step to the right. If I can move it, I can clear the path. 

But how do I move it? I need to be adjacent to it. Right now, I'm at the starting position. Let me try moving right. If I move right once, I'll be next to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, like down or left, to get it out of the way. 

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, I can proceed to the right towards the key. But wait, there are other walls down the path. I need to make sure I can navigate around them. Maybe I can also move some wall rules to create a path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I could push them aside. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. 

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is pass"" or ""wall is pass,"" that would help. But I don't see those rules either. So, perhaps the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to clear the immediate path. 

Let me plan the steps:
1. Move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down or left to remove it from the path.
3. Then, move right towards the key.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might require me to be adjacent. So, first, I need to move right to be next to it. Then, I can pick it up and move it. 

But in the current setup, moving right once would take me to the ""stop"" rule's position. Then, I can move it down. Let me try that.

So, the first action should be to move right. That way, I can interact with the ""stop"" rule and move it out of the way. Once that's done, I can proceed towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move the text blocks to change the rules. 

I see a rule ""is"" that's 6 steps to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" block next to another word, I can change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might help me reach the win condition.

But wait, the key is already the win condition. Maybe I need to change what counts as the win. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But how?

Alternatively, I could try to make the key moveable. If I can change the rule so that the key can be moved, I can bring it to me. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Looking at the positions, the key is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through the walls by changing their properties. If I can make the walls stop being walls, I can pass through.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or block something else. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to try to change the rule so that I can become the key. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can move as the key and reach the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key."" 

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" block is 6 steps to the left and 1 step up. I can move left to get closer. If I move left once, I'll be closer to the ""is"" block. Then, I can move up to get to it. Once I have the ""is"" block, I can rearrange it to create the new rule.

So, my first move should be to move left to get closer to the ""is"" block. That way, I can start forming the new rule that will help me win.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the right. If I move into that, I might get stopped. I don't want that. Maybe I can move up or down to bypass it. 

Looking at the map, if I move up, I might hit a wall. Moving down could be better. Let me check the positions again. The key is two steps right and one down. So, if I move right twice and down once, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

The walls are two steps to the left and various steps down, so moving right should be clear. Let me try moving right twice and then down once. That should get me to the key and win the level. 

Alternatively, if moving right is blocked, I might need to adjust. But from the description, it seems the path is clear. So, I'll go with moving right twice and then down once to reach the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there are several rules and walls. The key is located at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. I need to get to the key to win. But there are walls in the way, so I have to figure out how to move around them or change the rules to make the walls passable.

I see that there are rule blocks like ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `wall`."" Maybe I can move these to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that might make the walls immovable, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" maybe I can walk through them, but that might not be the case.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right. If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is win,"" but that doesn't seem useful since the key is already the win condition.

Let me think about the positions. The key is at (right 1, down 1). To get there, I need to move right once and down once. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might be blocking my path. Or maybe not, depending on the layout.

I'm a bit confused about the exact layout. Let me try to visualize it. The rule blocks are spread out, and the walls are mostly on the left side. The key is on the right, so I need to move right. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might be in the way if I'm starting from the left.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is wall,"" but that might make me a wall, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the key's position, but that might prevent me from winning. Hmm.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to choose one action that will help me progress towards the key.

If I move right, I might get closer to the key, but there might be walls blocking me. If I move up or down, maybe I can find a path around the walls. If I move left, I might be moving away from the key, which isn't helpful.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right. If I move right, I might hit the stop rule, which could prevent me from moving further. That's not good. So maybe I should move up or down first to avoid that.

Looking at the objects, the ball is at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. Maybe that's a distraction. The walls are mostly on the left and middle areas, so perhaps moving right is the way to go, but I need to find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without getting the key, but that seems unlikely since the active rule is ""key is win.""

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win without the key, but I don't see a ""win"" rule nearby. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to make ""baba is win.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is"" or something. Let me see. The ""baba"" rule is at 8 steps to the left and 5 steps down. That's far away. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is you,"" but that would make the key me, which might not help.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving right and see what happens. If I move right, I might hit the ""stop"" rule, which could prevent me from moving further. Alternatively, if I move up or down, I might find a clearer path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right. So if I move right, I'll be next to it. Maybe I can then move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, but I can only move it if it's not defined as ""stop."" Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. So that might not be possible.

I think the best course of action is to move right towards the key, even if it means potentially hitting the ""stop"" rule. Let's try that.

Wait, there's a rule ""wall"" at 9 steps to the left. That's far away, so probably not useful right now. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right, which might prevent me from moving further right. But I'm not sure how that affects me yet.

Looking at the objects on the map, there are several rules and walls. The key is located 1 step down, which is directly below me. But wait, there's a wall in the way. The wall is at 4 steps to the left and 1 step down. Hmm, so the key is behind a wall. I can't just move down because the wall is blocking me.

I need to figure out how to move the wall or change the rules to get to the key. Let me check the other rules. There's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right."" That probably means that whatever is to the right of the stop rule is stopped, so I can't move through it. 

There's also a ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left."" That might mean that the wall is defined as something else, but I'm not sure. Maybe if I can move the wall rule, I can change what a wall is. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 8 step to the left and 1 step up."" If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I could make ""key is win"" again, but that's already the case. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something to make the walls movable. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Let me think differently. 

I see a ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 5 steps down."" If I can move the ""baba"" rule, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure how that would help. 

Wait, the key is 1 step down, but there's a wall blocking it. If I can move the wall, I can get to the key. How can I move the wall? Maybe if I change the wall's property. 

There's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right."" If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can stop the wall from blocking me. But I'm not sure how to do that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule. The key is 1 step down, but it's blocked by a wall. If I can move the key somewhere else, I can reach it. But I don't see a way to do that immediately. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" If I can make the win condition something else, maybe I can bypass the key. But the current win condition is the key, so that might not help. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to break apart an existing rule. For example, if I can separate ""key"" from ""win,"" I can change the win condition. But I don't see how to do that right now. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to make myself into something else, like a block that can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 8 step to the left and 1 step up."" If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I could make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work. 

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try moving in a different direction. If I move right, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right."" So moving right is blocked. Moving left, there are walls, but maybe I can go around. 

Wait, the key is directly below me, but blocked by a wall. If I can move up, maybe I can go around. But moving up from my current position would take me to the wall at 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. That's also a wall, so I can't go up. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to move the wall somehow. Let me think about the rules again. The wall is defined by ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left."" If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" I can push them. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" the walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right."" If I can move that rule, maybe I can stop the wall from blocking me. But I'm not sure how. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me try moving left to see if I can find another way around. 

Wait, moving left from my current position would take me to the wall at 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. That's a wall, so I can't move left. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move up first, then left, but that's also blocked by walls. 

I'm stuck. I think I need to try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or make the walls movable. 

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule at 8 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move it next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can make ""wall is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would make me a wall, but that doesn't help. 

Wait, if I can make ""wall is win,"" then the walls would become the win condition, but that's not helpful since the key is still the win condition. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to move the key somehow. The key is 1 step down, but blocked by a wall. If I can move the key up, I can reach it. But I don't see a way to do that. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `key` 1 step to the left and 1 step up."" If I can move that rule, maybe I can change where the key is. But I'm not sure how. 

I'm stuck. I think I need to try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or make the walls movable.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The walls are all around, so I have to figure out a path. There's also a ball, but I'm not sure what it does yet. 

The rules are made up of text blocks like ""rule `is` 8 step to the left and 1 step up."" I think these are the rules that define how things work. Maybe I can move these text blocks to change the rules. 

I see that the key is at ""1 step down."" So if I can move down once, I might reach the key. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to find a way around them. 

Wait, the ball is at ""3 step to the left and 4 steps down."" Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how. 

I also notice that there are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks. Maybe I can rearrange them to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could become the key and win. But how do I do that? 

I think I need to move the ""key"" rule closer to me. Let me see where the ""key"" rule is. It's at ""1 step to the left and 1 step up."" So if I move left once and up once, I can get to it. But there are walls in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I'm not sure if that's possible. 

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""key"" rule closer. Let me try moving left once. That would take me to the position where the ""key"" rule is. But wait, there's a wall there. Hmm. 

Maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall. If I move up, I can then move left to get to the ""key"" rule. Let me try that. 

So, I'll move up first. That should take me out of the way of the wall. Then, I can move left to reach the ""key"" rule. Once I have the ""key"" rule, maybe I can change the win condition or move the key somewhere else. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at ""1 step to the right and 1 step up."" If I can move that closer, I might be able to win without getting the key. But I'm not sure. 

I think the best course of action is to move up to avoid the wall and then move left to get to the ""key"" rule. That way, I can try to change the rules to make myself the key or something else. 

So, I'll choose the ""up"" action first to move up one step. That should help me navigate around the wall and get closer to the ""key"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The walls are all around, so I have to navigate through them. There's also a ball, but I'm not sure what it does yet. 

The rules are displayed as text blocks. I can move these around to change the rules. For example, if I move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" it might change the win condition. But right now, the key is the win, so I just need to reach it.

I see the key is one step down from my current position. There's a wall blocking the way, but maybe I can move the wall or another object to create a path. Wait, the wall is at 4 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that wall, I might be able to get to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the ball pushable or something. But I'm not sure. Let me focus on getting to the key first. Since the key is directly below me, I should try moving down. But there's a wall there. Maybe I can move the wall to the side.

Looking at the rule blocks, I can move the ""stop"" rule to make something stop moving, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to change properties. Maybe if I make the wall stop, I can move through it. Wait, the wall is defined as ""wall,"" so it's probably immovable unless I change the rules.

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make it something else. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, maybe the walls become passable. But I'm not sure how to do that right now. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it something else, but that might not help. I think the best approach is to try moving down and see if I can break through or find a way around. 

Wait, the ball is at 3 steps to the left and 4 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to break through the wall. If I can make the ball push the wall, that might work. But I'm not sure how to control the ball. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make the wall into something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can move through it. But I'm not sure if that's possible. 

Let me try moving down first. If I can't move down because of the wall, I'll have to find another way. Maybe there's a path to the right or left. 

Wait, the key is one step down, but there's a wall there. Maybe I can move the wall to the right or left to create a space. If I can move the wall, I can get to the key. 

I think I'll try moving down to see if I can interact with the wall. If that doesn't work, I'll look for another way. 

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change ""baba"" into something else to gain abilities. For example, if I can make ""baba is push,"" I can push the wall. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" to win immediately, but the key is the current win condition. 

I think the best move is to try moving down and see what happens. If the wall stops me, I'll have to find another way, maybe by rearranging the rules to make the wall passable.
