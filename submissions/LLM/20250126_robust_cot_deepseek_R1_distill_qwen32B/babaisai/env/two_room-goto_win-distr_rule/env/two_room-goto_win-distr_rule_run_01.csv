Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means right now, the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the left of me. That's good because I can probably move towards it. But wait, there are walls around, so I need to see if I can get to the key without hitting any walls.

I also notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""key"" rule 5 steps right and 4 up, ""is"" 6 right and 4 up, ""win"" 7 right and 4 up, and ""wall"" 3 left and 3 up. There's also a ""stop"" rule 1 right and 2 up, which might be important because if I can move that, I can change what stops me.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. I'm currently at some position, and the key is to my left. Let me visualize this. If I'm at position (0,0), the key is at (-1,0). But there are walls to the right and up, so maybe I can't go right because of the walls. Wait, the walls are at 2 right and 4 up, 2 right and 3 up, etc. So maybe the path to the key is clear to the left.

But wait, the key is one step to the left, so I can just move left to get it. But if I do that, since the rule is ""key is win,"" picking up the key should win the level. But maybe there's a catch. Let me check if there are any other rules that might affect this.

Looking at the other rule blocks, there's a ""door"" rule 4 right and 1 up. Maybe the door is blocking the key? Or perhaps the door is somewhere else. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule nearby, which could be making some objects immovable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move that, I can change what stops me. For example, if I make ""baba is stop,"" then I can't move, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but walls are already stop by default, so maybe that's not useful.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block to combine with ""baba"" and ""you,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is one step to the left. So if I move left, I can pick it up. But let me check if there are any walls blocking me. The walls are at 2 right and various up positions, so to the right, but I'm moving left, so maybe I can go left without issues.

But wait, there's a wall at 2 right and 1 down. So if I'm at (0,0), moving left to (-1,0) is the key. But is there a wall in the way? The walls are at 2 right, so to the right, but not to the left. So I think I can move left safely.

So my plan is to move left to pick up the key, which should trigger the win condition because ""key is win."" But let me make sure there are no other rules that might interfere. For example, if there's a ""baba is stop"" rule, I can't move, but currently, the rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you,"" so I can move.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving into a wall. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at 2 right and various up positions, but I'm moving left, so I don't think I'm hitting any walls. The key is at (-1,0), so I can move left once to get it.

Alternatively, maybe the key is behind a wall, but according to the description, the key is one step to the left, so I think it's accessible.

So the best course of action is to move left to pick up the key, which should win the level.
