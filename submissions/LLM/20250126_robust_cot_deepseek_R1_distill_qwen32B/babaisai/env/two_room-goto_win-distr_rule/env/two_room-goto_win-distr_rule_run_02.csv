Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps right and 2 up. Then, there are several rule blocks: 'ball' is 7 right and 2 up, 'is' is 8 right and 2 up, 'win' is 9 right and 2 up. Also, there's a 'wall' rule 1 left and 1 up, another 'is' 1 up, a ball 2 right and 1 up, a wall 4 right and 1 up, a 'stop' rule 1 right, a 'key' rule 5 right, and more walls below.

Hmm, so the ball is the win condition, but it's placed 2 right and 1 up. I need to get to it. But there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at 4 right and various up/down positions, so maybe I can't go straight right because of them.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can change the properties of the walls. Because if a wall is 'stop', it's immovable. If I can change that, perhaps I can make the walls passable.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see 'ball', 'is', 'win' in a line to the right. Maybe I can rearrange them to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the 'ball' rule next to 'is' and 'win', I could make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already active. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" or something else.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 1 right. If I can move the 'is' rule next to it, maybe I can create a rule like ""wall is stop"" or ""something else is stop."" But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'key' rule. The 'key' is at 5 right. If I can make a rule like ""key is you,"" then I could switch to controlling the key, which might help me move other blocks.

But first, I need to get to the rule blocks. I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. The ball is 2 right and 1 up, but there's a wall 4 right and 2 up. So maybe I can't go straight to the ball because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' rule that's 1 up. If I can move that 'is' to the left, I could create a new rule. For example, if I move the 'is' to the left of 'ball', making ""ball is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule. The 'win' is 9 right and 2 up. If I can bring it closer, maybe I can change the win condition.

Wait, the 'baba' rule is 1 left and 4 down, and 'you' is 1 right and 4 down. So if I can move those, I could change who I am. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Let me think about the walls. The walls are at 4 right and various up/down positions. If I can make the walls not stop, then I can pass through them. So maybe I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop."" But how?

The 'stop' rule is at 1 right. If I can move the 'is' rule next to it, I could make ""stop is something."" But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'wall' rule next to 'is' and 'stop' to make ""wall is stop"" or ""wall is not stop.""

Wait, the 'wall' rule is 1 left and 1 up. If I can move that to the right, maybe I can combine it with 'is' and 'stop' to make a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' rule that's 1 up to the right, next to 'stop', making ""is is stop."" That doesn't make sense. Or maybe ""stop is something.""

Wait, perhaps I can move the 'ball' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'is' and 'win' to make a new rule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'key' rule. The 'key' is at 5 right. If I can make a rule like ""key is you,"" then I can switch to controlling the key, which might help me move other blocks.

But to do that, I need to get to the 'key' rule. But it's 5 right, which is blocked by walls. So maybe I need to first change the walls.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 1 right. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" then the walls become passable.

But how do I do that? I need to have the 'wall' rule, 'is' rule, and 'not stop' rule in a line. But I don't see a 'not' rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'wall' and 'is' to make ""wall is stop."" But that's the default, so it might not help.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing rules. The current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can break those, maybe I can change the win condition or who I am.

But I'm not sure how to break them. I think I can only change rules by moving the text blocks.

Wait, the 'ball' is 2 right and 1 up. If I can get to it, I can win. But the walls are blocking the way. So maybe I need to find a way to move the walls or change their properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'is' and 'win' to make a new rule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the 'ball' rule is 7 right and 2 up. If I can move it to the left, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is something else.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'is' and 'ball' to make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already active.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. The ball is 2 right and 1 up, but there's a wall 4 right and 2 up. So maybe I can't go straight to the ball because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can go up first. If I go up, I can see if there's a way around. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' rule that's 1 up to the right, so that it's next to 'stop' and create a new rule like ""is is stop."" But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'wall' and 'is' to make ""wall is stop."" But that's the default, so it might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'wall' rule to the right, so that it's next to 'is' and 'stop' to make ""wall is stop."" Again, same as default.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. The 'key' is at 5 right. If I can get to it, maybe I can use it to open something. But it's blocked by walls.

Wait, the 'key' rule is 5 right. If I can make a rule like ""key is you,"" then I can switch to controlling the key, which might help me move other blocks.

But to do that, I need to get to the 'key' rule. But it's 5 right, which is blocked by walls. So maybe I need to first change the walls.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 1 right. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" then the walls become passable.

But how do I do that? I need to have the 'wall' rule, 'is' rule, and 'not stop' rule in a line. But I don't see a 'not' rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'stop' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'wall' and 'is' to make ""wall is stop."" But that's the default, so it might not help.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing rules. The current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can break those, maybe I can change the win condition or who I am.

But I'm not sure how to break them. I think I can only change rules by moving the text blocks.

Wait, the 'ball' is 2 right and 1 up. If I can get to it, I can win. But the walls are blocking the way. So maybe I need to find a way to move the walls or change their properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'is' and 'win' to make a new rule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the 'ball' rule is 7 right and 2 up. If I can move it to the left, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is something else.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the left, so that it's next to 'is' and 'ball' to make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already active.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think of the possible moves. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle.

If I move right, I can get closer to the walls and the rule blocks. But the walls are blocking the way. So maybe I need to move up first to get around.

Wait, if I move up, I can see if there's a way to get to the rule blocks without going through the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left, but I don't see any objects to the left except the 'wall' rule 1 left and 1 up.

Wait, the 'wall' rule is 1 left and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving right first.

So, I think the best course of action is to move right to get closer to the rule blocks and see if I can rearrange them to change the rules.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I control Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball located 1 step to the right and 1 step up from my current position. There are also several walls and rule blocks around. The rule blocks are spread out, with ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" placed in different locations.

My goal is to make the ball the win condition, so I need to get the ball to the exit or wherever the win condition is. But wait, the active rule says ""ball is win,"" so maybe I just need to pick up the ball? Or perhaps I need to move the rule blocks to change the rules.

I notice that the ball is near some walls, so maybe I can move it by manipulating the rules. The rule blocks are scattered, so I can try moving them to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make the ball stop moving or change its properties.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I move that, maybe I can make the ball stop, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule like ""baba is key"" to unlock something, but I don't see a key in the active rules.

Let me think about the positions. The ball is 1 right and 1 up. I can move right and up to reach it. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 3 right and 2 up, so maybe I can go around them. Alternatively, if I can change the rules to make the walls passable, that would help.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Or maybe ""wall is you,"" but that would make me a wall, which might not help.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" but that might not be necessary. My main goal is to get the ball to the win condition, which is already set as ""ball is win."" So maybe I just need to move the ball to the exit.

But where is the exit? The active rules don't mention it, so perhaps the exit is where the ball is. Or maybe I need to move the ball to a specific location. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the ball is 1 right and 1 up. If I move right and up, I can reach it. But there are walls blocking the way. Let me check the walls' positions. There's a wall at 3 right and 2 up, which is above the ball. So maybe I can go around it.

Alternatively, I could try to move the rule blocks to create a path. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. But I'm not sure how that works. Maybe if I make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" is 4 steps to the right. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something, but I don't see a lock in the active rules.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on moving the ball. Since the ball is 1 right and 1 up, I can try to move right and up to reach it. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the path.

If I move right once, I'll be at 1 right. Then up once, but there's a wall at 3 right and 2 up. Wait, maybe I can go around. Let me try to move right twice, then up, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to push the ball. For example, if I can make ""baba is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" to combine with ""baba"" and ""push"" to make ""baba is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is already the win condition, so maybe I just need to move it to the exit. But where is the exit? I'm not sure. Maybe the exit is where the ball is, so I just need to pick it up.

But how do I pick it up? In Baba Is You, you can pick up objects by moving into them. So if I move right and up to the ball, I can pick it up. But there are walls blocking the way.

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 2 up, which is above the ball. So maybe I can go around. Let me try to move right twice, then up, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls. If I can change the rules to make walls movable, I can move them out of the way. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" but that would make me a wall, which might not help.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule to combine with ""stop"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to combine with ""wall"" to make ""stop is wall,"" but that might not help. Or maybe ""wall is stop,"" which is already the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball directly. Let me try to move right and up to reach it. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that to the right, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule to the right to combine with ""is"" and ""something else.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" but that might not help.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that to the left, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the win condition to something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is already the win condition, so maybe I just need to move it to the exit. But where is the exit? I'm not sure. Maybe the exit is where the ball is, so I just need to pick it up.

But how do I pick it up? I need to move into it. Let me try to move right and up to reach it. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule to the right to combine with ""is"" and ""something else.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" but that might not help.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" is 4 steps to the right. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something, but I don't see a lock in the active rules.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the rule blocks again. The ""ball"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the ball's properties.

Wait, if I can move the ""ball"" rule to combine with ""is"" and ""win,"" that's already the case. So maybe I need to create a new rule. For example, ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball.

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""ball"" and ""you."" The ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that to the left, maybe I can create ""ball is you.""

Yes, that makes sense. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and move it to the win condition. So how do I do that?

I need to move the ""is"" rule from 7 right and 2 up to between ""ball"" and ""you."" The ""ball"" rule is at 6 right and 2 up, and ""you"" is at 4 steps down. Wait, that's not in the same row. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to combine with ""ball"" and ""you.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule down to combine with ""is"" and ""you."" But that might be complicated.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 4 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule down to 4 steps down, then I can create ""ball is you."" But I'm not sure how to move the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule down to 4 steps down, but that's where ""you"" is. So combining ""ball"" and ""you"" with ""is"" in between would make ""ball is you.""

Yes, that's the plan. So I need to move the ""ball"" rule down to 4 steps down, where ""you"" is. But how do I move the ""ball"" rule? I can only move rule blocks that are not ""stop.""

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at 6 right and 2 up. I can move it by moving into it. So I need to get to that position.

But to get there, I have to move right 6 times and up 2 times, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" I can move them, but that would make me a wall, which might not help.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to combine with ""ball"" to make ""stop is ball,"" but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to create ""ball is you.""

The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 2 up. I need to move it to between ""ball"" and ""you."" So I need to move it down to where ""you"" is, which is 4 steps down.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not ""stop."" So I can move it by moving into it. So I need to get to 7 right and 2 up.

To get there, I have to move right 7 times and up 2 times, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 2 up, so maybe I can go right 3 times, then up, but that's blocked. Alternatively, go right 4 times and up, but that's also blocked.

Hmm, maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push them aside. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 4 steps to the right. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something, but I don't see a lock.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to create a new rule. For example, ""key is you,"" so I can pick up the key and use it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 4 steps to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can create ""key is you,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to create ""stop is key,"" but that might not help.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ball directly. Let me try to move right and up to reach it. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule to the right to combine with ""is"" and ""something else.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""ball"" rule to combine with ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""ball is you.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to create ""stop is key,"" but that might not help.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create ""ball is you."" Let me try that.

The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 2 up. I need to move it to between ""ball"" and ""you."" So I need to move it down to where ""you"" is, which is 4 steps down.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not ""stop."" So I can move it by moving into it. So I need to get to 7 right and 2 up.

To get there, I have to move right 7 times and up 2 times, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 2 up, so maybe I can go right 3 times, then up, but that's blocked. Alternatively, go right 4 times and up, but that's also blocked.

Hmm, maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push them aside. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to create ""stop is key,"" but that might not help.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ball directly. The ball is 1 right and 1 up. So I can move right once and up once to reach it.

But there's a wall at 3 right and 2 up, which is above the ball. So maybe I can go around. Let me try to move right twice, then up, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball that's one step to the right and one step up from me. There are also several walls and rule blocks around. The rule blocks are spread out, and some of them are ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you."" 

I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since the ball is already set as win, maybe I need to move it to a position where I can reach it. But wait, the ball is an object, so I can't move it directly unless I change the rules. 

Hmm, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move the ball. If I can make the ball movable, I can push it towards the win condition. Alternatively, I could change the win condition to something else, but that might complicate things. 

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""stop"" is one step to the right. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe I can make the ball movable. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""ball is push"" or ""ball is move."" 

Wait, I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rule blocks to create a new rule. If I move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can form ""ball is win,"" which is already active. Maybe I need to rearrange other rules. 

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself into something else, but that might not help. Let me focus on the ball. Since the ball is one step right and up, I can move towards it. But I need to make sure I can move without being blocked by walls. 

I should check the surrounding walls. There's a wall three steps to the right and two up, which might block my path. Maybe I can move around it. Let me plan my steps. 

I think the best course of action is to move towards the ball. Since I'm Baba and the ball is win, I need to reach the ball. So, I'll move right and up to get closer. 

Wait, but if I move right, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the right. That might prevent me from moving further. Maybe I should move up first to avoid the stop. 

Alternatively, I can move left or down to find a path. Let me visualize the map. The ball is one step right and up, so moving right and up would get me closer. But the ""stop"" rule is in the way. 

Perhaps I can move up first, then right. Let me try that. 

So, I'll move up first to avoid the stop rule, then move right towards the ball. That should help me get closer without being blocked. 

Wait, but if I move up, I might hit another wall. Let me check the objects again. There's a wall three steps right and two up, so moving up from my current position might not hit a wall immediately. 

I think moving up is a safe first step. Then, I can move right towards the ball. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to access other rule blocks and change the rules to make the ball movable. But that might take more steps. 

I think the quickest way is to move towards the ball. So, I'll move up first, then right. 

Wait, but the ball is one step right and one step up. So, moving up and then right would take me two steps, but maybe I can reach it in one move. 

No, each action is one step. So, I need to plan each step carefully. 

Let me try moving up first. That should get me closer to the ball without hitting the stop rule. Then, I can move right. 

Alternatively, moving right first might lead me into the stop rule, which would prevent me from moving further. So, moving up first is better. 

I think moving up is the best first action. That way, I can approach the ball without being blocked. 

Wait, but if I move up, I might be moving away from the ball. Let me double-check the positions. The ball is one step right and one step up, so moving up would take me closer in the vertical direction but not the horizontal. 

Hmm, maybe moving right first is better, even if it means dealing with the stop rule. But if I move right into the stop rule, I can't move further. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to access the ""is"" rule and change the rules. But that might take more time. 

I think the best immediate action is to move up to avoid the stop rule and get closer to the ball. 

Wait, but moving up might not get me closer to the ball. Let me think again. The ball is one step right and one step up, so moving up would align me vertically with the ball, but I still need to move right. 

Alternatively, moving right first would get me closer horizontally, but I might hit the stop rule. 

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving right first and see what happens. If I hit the stop rule, I can't move further, so that's not good. 

Alternatively, moving up first might be safer. Let me try that. 

So, I'll choose to move up first. That way, I can approach the ball without being blocked by the stop rule. 

Wait, but moving up might not be the most efficient. Maybe I should move right and then up. 

I think I need to prioritize avoiding the stop rule. So, moving up first to get out of its way, then moving right towards the ball. 

Yes, that makes sense. So, my first action should be to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the ball is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball that's one step to the right. There are also several walls and rule blocks. The rule blocks are arranged in a line: ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""is,"" etc. 

I need to figure out how to make the ball the win condition. Since ""ball is win"" is already active, maybe I need to move the ball to where the win condition is. But wait, the ball is already one step to the right, and the win rule is further to the right. 

Hmm, maybe I should move the ball closer to the win rule. But how? I can only move text blocks that aren't ""stop."" The ball is an object, so I can move it. Let me check the positions again. The ball is at 1 step right, and the win rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. 

Wait, maybe I should move the ball up to where the win rule is. If I move the ball up, it might align with the win rule, making it the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to change the win condition. 

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule one step right and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent something from stopping me. But I'm not sure. 

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. Maybe I should move Baba to the ball and then move the ball to the win position. But how do I do that? 

Wait, the ball is one step to the right. If I move right, I can get next to the ball. Then, maybe I can push the ball further right towards the win rule. Let me try that. 

So, I'll move right to get next to the ball. Then, I can push the ball right again. But I need to make sure there's space. The wall is three steps to the right, so pushing the ball right might hit the wall. Maybe I need to move the wall first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" next to ""win,"" maybe I can make ""win is something else."" But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step right and one step down. If I move that, maybe I can prevent the ball from stopping. But I'm not sure how that helps. 

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball up to where the win rule is. Let me try moving up. If I move up, I can get closer to the win rule. Then, maybe I can push the ball up as well. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to break the existing rules. If I move the ""ball"" rule away from ""is"" and ""win,"" maybe I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the ""key"" rule is four steps to the right and one step down. Maybe that's a distraction. I should focus on the ball and the win condition. 

Let me try moving right to get next to the ball. Then, I can push the ball right towards the win rule. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking the way. The wall is three steps to the right, so pushing the ball two steps right would get it to the win rule's position. 

So, I'll move right to get next to the ball, then push it right twice. That should place the ball where the win rule is, making it the win condition. 

Wait, but the win rule is already active. Maybe I just need to move the ball to the win position. Let me try that. 

I think the best course of action is to move right to get next to the ball, then push it right to the win position. So, I'll choose the right action.
