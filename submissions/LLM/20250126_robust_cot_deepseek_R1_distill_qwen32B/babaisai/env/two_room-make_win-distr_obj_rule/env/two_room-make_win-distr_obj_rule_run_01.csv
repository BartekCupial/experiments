Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, a wall, some rules, a ball, and other walls. The rules are spread out, so I need to figure out how to manipulate them. The key is one step left and two up from me. There's also a ""win"" rule eight steps right and two up. Hmm, that's a bit far, but maybe I can create a new rule to change the win condition.

I notice there's a ""key"" rule six steps right and one down. Maybe if I can move the key to a position where it can be used to unlock something. But first, I need to see what other rules are present. There's a ""stop"" rule one step up, which might be blocking movement. If I can move that, I might be able to get past it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step up. If I can move that rule away, maybe I can move up without being stopped. But how? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" So I need to change the rule so that the wall isn't stopping me.

Looking at the walls, they're placed in various positions. There's a wall three steps right and two up, which might be blocking the path to the ""win"" rule. If I can remove that wall or change its property, I might be able to reach the ""win"" rule.

I also see a ""ball"" rule six steps right and four down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure yet. The ball is two steps left and one down from me, so it's nearby. If I can make the ball move, perhaps it can help in some way.

The key is close, one step left and two up. Maybe I can pick up the key and use it to unlock a door or change a rule. But I need to get to the key first. The path to the key might be blocked by walls or the ""stop"" rule.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make a new rule like ""something is win,"" which could change the win condition.

The ""stop"" rule is one step up. If I can move that, I can change the property of the wall or another object. Maybe if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is push"" or something like that, I can push the walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here, so maybe that's not possible.

Wait, the ""ball"" is nearby. If I can make the ball move, perhaps it can push walls. But I need to figure out how to make the ball move. Maybe if I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and push walls. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Let me outline the steps I can take:

1. Move towards the key to pick it up. But I need to check if the path is clear. The key is one step left and two up. Are there walls blocking that path? There's a wall three steps right and two up, which might be on the same row but to the right. So maybe the path to the key is clear.

2. Once I have the key, I can look for a lock or a rule that requires the key. The ""key"" rule is six steps right and one down. Maybe if I can move the key next to that rule, I can create a new rule like ""key is key,"" which might not do anything, but perhaps it's part of a larger plan.

3. Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, and I just need to reach it. But I need to see if that's possible.

4. The ""win"" rule is eight steps right and two up. That's quite far, but if I can change the win condition to something closer, like the ball, I can win without moving too far.

5. The ""stop"" rule is one step up. If I can move that rule away, I can move up without being stopped. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall to make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

6. There's also a ""baba"" rule two steps left and four down. If I can move that next to ""is,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is something,"" which might change my properties.

Wait, I'm controlling Baba, so if I can change the rule to ""baba is something else,"" I can gain new abilities. For example, if I can make ""baba is push,"" I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I become the win condition, and I just need to reach myself, which is already done. But that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on creating a new rule that changes the win condition. Let's see, the ""win"" rule is eight steps right and two up. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""something is win."" For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition, and I just need to reach the key.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""win."" The ""is"" rules are at various positions. There's an ""is"" rule seven steps right and two up, which is next to the ""win"" rule. So if I can move that ""is"" rule to be adjacent to ""win,"" I can create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is already next to ""win."" So the rule is ""win is is""? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to move another ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to an ""is"" rule. But I can't move the ""win"" rule because it's a rule, and I can only move objects or text blocks that aren't defined as ""stop"" or similar.

Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by pushing them. So if I can get next to the ""win"" rule, I can push it to create a new rule.

But the ""win"" rule is eight steps right and two up. That's quite far. Maybe I should look for a closer ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

Looking back, there's an ""is"" rule one step left and one down. If I can move that next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move it next to ""key,"" I can make ""key is something.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is something.""

Wait, the ""ball"" is two steps left and one down. The ""is"" rule is one step left and one down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball,"" I can create ""ball is something."" But I need to see what's next to ""ball.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" to make ""you is something,"" which could change my properties.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you,"" I can create a new rule like ""you is something,"" which might give me new abilities.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create a rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is pass,"" but again, I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I should try to create a rule that changes the win condition to something I can reach. Let's say I make ""key is win."" Then, reaching the key would win the level. The key is one step left and two up, which is close. So how can I create that rule?

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" Wait, the ""key"" rule is six steps right and one down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from one step left and one down to next to ""key."" Let me see:

The ""key"" rule is six steps right and one down. The ""is"" rule is one step left and one down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule six steps right and one down, it would be next to ""key."" But that's a long distance, and I might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to an ""is"" rule. But I can't move the ""key"" rule because it's a rule, not an object. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks, including rules, as long as they're not defined as ""stop.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is six steps right and one down. If I can get next to it, I can push it. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving an ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball,"" I can make ""ball is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Wait, the ""ball"" is two steps left and one down. The ""is"" rule is one step left and one down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball,"" I can create ""ball is something."" But I need to see what's next to ""ball.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" to make ""you is something,"" which could change my properties.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you,"" I can create a new rule like ""you is something,"" which might give me new abilities.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create a rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is positioned 1 step left and 2 steps up from my current position. There are several walls around, which might block my path, but since the rule ""stop"" is present, I can't move through walls unless I change the rules.

I notice there are multiple rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 2 up, and a ""rule `win`"" at 8 steps right and 2 up. Also, there's a ""rule `wall`"" 2 steps left and 1 up, which might be useful. The ""rule `stop`"" is just 1 step up, which probably means walls are currently stoppable.

I think the key might be important here. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But to get to the key, I need to move left and up. However, there's a wall 3 steps right and 2 up, which might be in the way. Wait, no, the key is to the left, so maybe the walls to the right aren't blocking me directly.

Let me plan my path. I'm currently at the starting position. To reach the key, I need to move left once and up twice. But I should check if there are any walls in that path. The walls are mostly to the right, so maybe the path to the key is clear. Let me try moving left first.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving towards the ""rule `wall`"" which is 2 steps left and 1 up. If I can move that rule block, maybe I can change the wall's properties. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" which is 1 step up. If I can move that, I can make walls passable.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The other rules are scattered, but I can move them if they're not stopped. Since ""stop"" is a rule, maybe the walls are stoppable because of that.

I think the best first step is to move towards the key. So, I'll start by moving left to get closer to it. That should help me progress towards the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is two steps up, which might be important. There are several rule blocks like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These rule blocks can be moved to create new rules or modify existing ones.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can create a new rule that changes what ""WIN"" means, maybe I can win without reaching that specific block. Alternatively, I could try to make myself into the ""WIN"" object or change the win condition.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls passable or stop certain objects from moving. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something or change its property.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change the environment. Maybe I can make the ball do something useful.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules. Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Each move could potentially bring me closer to a rule block I can use.

If I move up, I might reach the key or some rule blocks. Moving right could get me closer to the ""win"" rule or other important blocks. Moving down might lead me to the ""ball"" or other rule blocks. Left might not be as useful since there's a wall there.

I think the best approach is to move right to get closer to the ""win"" rule and other rule blocks. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes the key into something else. Alternatively, I could try to make the ball push a wall or change its property.

Wait, if I move right, I can get to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something else."" Or maybe I can make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key would win the level.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is key,"" so I can pick up the key and then use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Another idea: if I can make ""stop is you,"" then I can stop myself or other objects. But I'm not sure if that helps.

I think the key is to create a new rule that either changes the win condition or allows me to reach the win block. Let me try to move right to get closer to the rule blocks. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" to create a new rule.

So, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is positioned 1 step to the left and 2 steps up from my current position. There's also a ""rule `win`"" block 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might be important because if I can manipulate the win condition, I could change how I win the level.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and a ""rule `wall`"" block 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. These could be used to change the properties of objects or create new rules.

Since I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar, I need to check if any of these rule blocks are movable. The ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step up, so I should avoid moving that unless necessary.

My initial thought is to move towards the key because keys often unlock something. But before I do that, I should see if moving any rule blocks can help me reach the key or the win condition more easily.

If I move the ""rule `is`"" block near the key, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key something else, like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. That way, I just need to reach the key to win.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `win`"" block closer to me or change what defines the win condition. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then just being myself would win the level.

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" block. It's 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is quite far. Maybe I can break down the existing rules or create new ones to make movement easier.

Wait, there's a ""rule `wall`"" block 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I move that, I could potentially change the properties of walls, making them passable or something else. That might help me navigate the level more freely.

Another idea: the ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step up. If I can move that, I could stop certain objects from moving or change their behavior. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" block 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball do something, like push objects, it could help me reach the key or the win condition.

But let's focus on the key first. It's 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I move left and up, I can reach it. But are there walls blocking me? There are walls at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, so maybe I need to go around.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is to the right, but I need to go left. So maybe the path to the key is clear. Let me try moving left and up.

But before I move, I should check if moving any rule blocks can make the key the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the key and the ""rule `win`"" block.

Alternatively, I could make ""baba is win,"" which would mean I win just by existing. But that might not be necessary if I can reach the key.

Hmm, maybe I should first move towards the key. Let me plan my steps. I need to go left once and up twice. So, left, up, up. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, they are positioned at 3 steps to the right and various up/down positions. So moving left and up should be clear. Let me try that.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving towards the ""rule `wall`"" block. If I can move that, I could change the walls. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule. For example, moving it next to the key and the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block, which is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe it's better to first reach the key and see what happens.

Wait, the key is 1 step left and 2 steps up. So from my current position, I can move left once and up twice. Let me try that.

But before I do, I should check if there are any walls in that path. The walls are at 3 steps to the right, so moving left should be clear. Let me proceed.

I move left once, then up twice. Now I'm at the key's position. But I need to pick it up or use it somehow. Wait, in Baba Is You, picking up objects usually involves moving into them, which can change the rules.

But since the key is an object, maybe I can move it. Let me try to move the key. But I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" I don't see a ""STOP"" rule for the key, so I can move it.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move one object at a time. So I need to decide whether to move the key or another rule block.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule. Let me think about that.

If I can move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the key and the ""rule `win`"" block, I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition, so I just need to reach it.

But the ""rule `is`"" block is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is far. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block closer. It's 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's even farther.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for other rule blocks that could help.

There's a ""rule `baba`"" block 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. If I can move that, I could change what Baba is. For example, making ""baba is key"" would mean I can open locks or something.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think again about the key. If I can make the key the win condition, then reaching it would win the level. So I need to create ""key is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the key and the ""rule `win`"" block. But that requires moving the ""rule `is`"" block 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is a lot.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block closer. It's 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's even farther.

Wait, maybe I can break down the existing rules. For example, if I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block, I could stop certain objects from moving or change their behavior. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: the ""rule `ball`"" block is 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. If I can make the ball do something, like push objects, it could help me reach the key or the win condition.

But I'm not sure how to use that right now. Let me focus on the key and the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `you`"" block, which is 4 steps down. If I can make ""you is win,"" then I would win by existing. But that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is win,"" which would mean I win by existing. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win by existing. But I need to create that rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to Baba and the ""rule `win`"" block. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block next to Baba and the ""rule `is`"" block. But again, that's far.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first and see if I can use it somehow.

I move left once and up twice to reach the key. Now, I can try to move the key. Let me see where I can move it. Maybe I can move it next to the ""rule `win`"" block to create ""key is win.""

But the ""rule `win`"" block is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is far. I can't move the key that far in one step.

Wait, maybe I can move the key closer to me. Let me try moving the key left or right.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should look for other rule blocks that can help me.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, I can create a new rule closer to me.

For example, moving it next to the key and the ""rule `win`"" block. But again, the ""rule `win`"" block is far.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, making ""wall is nothing"" so I can walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to a wall and the ""rule `nothing`"" block. But I don't see a ""rule `nothing`"" block in the list.

Wait, maybe I can create ""wall is stop"" or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so the ball can be controlled and help me push objects.

But I'm not sure how to do that right now. Let me think again about the key.

If I can make the key the win condition, then reaching it would win the level. So I need to create ""key is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the key and the ""rule `win`"" block. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block next to the key and the ""rule `is`"" block. But that's also far.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is positioned 1 step to the left and 2 steps up from my current position. There are walls in various places, which might block my path. The rule blocks are scattered around, and I notice there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's probably the win condition I need to reach.

I also see a ""stop"" rule 1 step up. If I move up, I might hit that, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to be careful about that. The ball is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down, but I'm not sure how that affects me yet.

My initial thought is to move towards the key since it might be necessary to unlock something. But before I do that, I should check if moving in that direction is possible without hitting any walls or getting stopped by the ""stop"" rule.

If I move left, I can get closer to the key. Let me see: moving left once would bring me closer, but I need to make sure there's no wall blocking that path. The wall is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, so moving left shouldn't interfere with that immediately. However, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is closer. But since I'm moving left, that wall might not be in my way.

Wait, actually, the walls are positioned relative to my current location. So if I'm at the starting point, moving left would take me towards the key, but I need to ensure there are no walls in that path. The walls are mostly to the right, so moving left might be safe.

Alternatively, moving up could be risky because of the ""stop"" rule. If I move up, I might trigger the stop, which would prevent me from moving further. That's probably not ideal, especially if I need to move around more.

Another option is to move right, but that would take me away from the key and towards the walls. That might not be helpful unless I need to access something on the right side, like the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I need to create a new rule or modify an existing one to make reaching it easier. For example, if I can make the key into a ""WIN"" object, then picking it up would win the level.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""key"" rule 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that closer, I might be able to create a new rule like ""key is win."" That way, picking up the key would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule block and the ""win"" rule block next to each other or position them in a way that I can form a new rule. But first, I need to get to those rule blocks.

Since the ""key"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down, and the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, I might need to move right several times. But moving right could take me into walls. Let me check the walls again.

There are walls at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, 3 steps to the right, 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down, 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down. So moving right beyond 3 steps might be blocked by walls.

Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can bypass the walls. But the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up, so moving up might stop me. Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule out of the way, I could move up without being stopped.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move it somewhere else, like to the left or right, then moving up would be possible. But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since it's 1 step up, I can move up, but that would trigger the stop. Maybe I can find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ""stop"" rule not stop me. For example, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then the stop would be me, but that might not help. Or maybe ""stop is push,"" allowing me to push through it.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that closer, I can create new rules. But that's quite far, and moving right is blocked by walls.

Another approach: the ball is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. Maybe the ball can be used to break through walls or something, but I'm not sure how.

Let me think again. My main goal is to reach the ""win"" condition. The current win is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is blocked by walls. So I need to either change the win condition or find a way to reach it.

If I can make the key into the win condition, then I just need to pick up the key. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""key is win."" To create that rule, I need to have the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule adjacent to each other with an ""is"" in between.

The ""key"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down, and the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So if I can move the ""key"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is, and then move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can form ""key is win.""

But moving the ""key"" rule requires getting to it, which is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. But moving right is blocked by walls at 3 steps. So I can't get there directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move it down, I can place it next to the ""key"" rule.

But to move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. That would require moving right 7 steps and up 2 steps, which is blocked by walls. So that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me look for other rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can change that, maybe I can make walls passable.

For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push through walls. But to do that, I need to have the ""wall"" rule and the ""push"" rule adjacent with an ""is"" in between. But I don't see a ""push"" rule listed, so that might not be possible.

Wait, maybe I can create a ""push"" rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another rule. But without a ""push"" rule, that's not helpful.

Another idea: the ""ball"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to break through walls or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into a ball, so I can roll through walls. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""baba is ball."" The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down, and the ""ball"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""baba"" and ""ball"" rules are, I can create ""baba is ball.""

But again, moving the ""is"" rule that far is blocked by walls. So that's not feasible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule or the ""ball"" rule closer. The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. If I can move that up, I can place it next to the ""is"" rule. But moving the ""baba"" rule requires being adjacent to it, which would require moving down 4 steps and left 2 steps, which might be blocked by walls.

This is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first, as it's closer. The key is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So if I move left once and up twice, I can reach it. But I need to check if that path is clear.

Moving left once: is there a wall there? The walls are mostly to the right, so moving left should be okay. Then moving up twice: the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up, so moving up once would trigger it, stopping me. That's a problem.

So I can't move up because of the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move around it. If I move left first, then up, I might avoid the ""stop"" rule. Let me see: moving left once, then up once. But the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up from my current position, so moving left and then up might still hit it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first to avoid the ""stop"" rule. Moving down once would take me away from the ""stop"" rule, then I can move left and up. But moving down might take me into other walls or objects.

Looking at the objects, moving down once would take me to where the ball is: 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So if I move down once, I'm at the ball's position. Then I can move left once and up twice to reach the key. But I need to check if that's possible.

Wait, if I move down once, I'm at the ball's position. Then moving left once would take me further left, and then up twice. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. The walls are mostly to the right, so moving left and up might be clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball somewhere. If I can push the ball to create a path, that might help. But I'm not sure how.

Another thought: if I can make the ""stop"" rule not stop me, then I can move up freely. To do that, I need to change the rule. For example, making ""stop is push"" would allow me to push through it. But I don't have a ""push"" rule, so that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I can create a ""push"" rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another rule. But without a ""push"" rule, that's not helpful.

This is tricky. Let me summarize:

- I need to reach the ""win"" condition, which is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, but it's blocked by walls.
- The key is closer, 1 step left and 2 steps up, but moving up is blocked by the ""stop"" rule.
- I can't move right beyond 3 steps due to walls.
- I need to find a way to either change the win condition or bypass the walls.

Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that changes the win condition to something I can reach. For example, making the key the win condition.

To do that, I need to create ""key is win."" The ""key"" rule is 6 steps right and 1 step down, and the ""win"" rule is 8 steps right and 2 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 7 steps right and 2 steps up.

If I can move the ""key"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is, then I can place the ""win"" rule next to it. But moving the ""key"" rule requires getting to it, which is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is. But that's also blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move it down, I can place it next to the ""key"" rule. But moving the ""win"" rule requires being adjacent to it, which is blocked by walls.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps I can make the walls passable by changing their rules.

The ""wall"" rule is 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can change that to ""wall is push,"" then I can push through walls. But I don't have a ""push"" rule, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls would disappear. But I don't have a ""nothing"" rule either.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule, I can create ""stop is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""stop is you,"" which would mean I am the stop, but that might not help.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try moving in a different direction. Let's see: if I move right, I hit walls quickly. Moving up is blocked by ""stop."" Moving down takes me to the ball. Maybe the ball can be used somehow.

If I move down once, I'm at the ball's position. Then I can move left or right. Moving left from there might take me towards the key. Let me try that.

So, first move down once to get to the ball. Then move left once to get closer to the key. Then move up twice to reach the key. But I need to check if moving up from there is blocked.

Wait, moving up from the ball's position: the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up from my starting position, but if I'm at the ball's position, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down, moving up once would take me to 2 steps left and 0 steps down, which is where the ""wall"" rule is 2 steps left and 1 step up. So moving up from the ball's position would take me into the ""wall"" rule, which might block me.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall rule. But I don't know if that's possible.

This is really challenging. I think I need to try moving left first to get closer to the key, even if it means dealing with the ""stop"" rule. Let me try moving left once, then up once, but I'll hit the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can push it.

Wait, if I move left once, I'm at 1 step left. Then moving up once would take me to 1 step left and 1 step up, which is where the ""wall"" rule is 2 steps left and 1 step up. So I'm not sure if that's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left twice to get to 2 steps left, then up once to reach the key. But I need to check the path.

Moving left twice: from starting position, left once, left again. Then up once. But I'm not sure if that's blocked by walls.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving left once and see what happens. If it's blocked, I'll have to find another way. But since I can't see the exact layout, I have to make an educated guess.

I think the best course of action is to move left once to get closer to the key, then up twice to reach it. Even though there's a ""stop"" rule, maybe I can push through it or it's not in the way.

So, I'll choose to move left once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is two steps up, which might be important. There are also several rule blocks like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These rule blocks can be moved to create new rules or modify existing ones.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's pretty far, so maybe I need to create a new rule to make reaching it easier. The ""key"" is nearby, so perhaps I can use it to unlock something or change a rule.

I also see a ""ball"" rule block 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball into something useful, like a tool to break walls or change the win condition.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to avoid walls and other obstacles. The walls are placed in a way that might block my path, so I need to find a way around or through them.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. I need to plan a path that gets me closer to the key or the rule blocks. Maybe moving right will help me access more rule blocks to change the game's rules.

If I move right, I can get closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" rule blocks. Perhaps I can rearrange them to create a new rule that makes the win condition easier to reach or changes what I need to do to win.

Alternatively, moving up towards the key might be a good idea. If I can pick up the key, maybe it can be used to unlock a door or change a rule that's currently blocking me.

I also see a ""stop"" rule block, which might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. If I can move that, I might be able to create a path for myself.

Another thought: if I can make Baba into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to roll through walls or reach areas I couldn't before. That could help me get to the win condition faster.

I should also consider the ""you"" rule block. If I can change what ""you"" is, I might gain new abilities or change how I interact with the environment.

Hmm, maybe I should start by moving right to get closer to the rule blocks. That way, I can start experimenting with creating new rules to make the level easier.

Wait, but moving right might take me into more walls. I need to check if there's a clear path. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various up and down positions. Maybe I can go around them by moving up first.

If I move up, I can get to the key, which might be useful. Then, from there, I can move right towards the rule blocks. That seems like a viable path.

Alternatively, moving down might lead me to the ball rule block, which could be useful for changing the game mechanics. But that's further down, and I'm not sure if it's necessary right now.

I think the key is more immediate. Getting the key might unlock something or allow me to change a rule that's currently preventing me from progressing. So, moving up towards the key seems like a good first step.

Once I have the key, I can look for a lock or a rule that requires the key to be changed. Maybe the key can be used to move a rule block that's currently a wall or stop, allowing me to create a new path.

In summary, my plan is to move up to get the key, then use it to manipulate the rule blocks and create a new rule that helps me reach the win condition. Alternatively, if moving up is blocked, I might need to find another way around.

But wait, looking back at the map, the key is two steps up, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I need to move around the walls by going right first, then up. Let me visualize the map:

- Key is 2 steps up.
- Walls are at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, so moving right might take me into walls. Maybe I should move up first to avoid them.

Alternatively, if I move left, I might find a clearer path, but the key is to the left as well. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Perhaps the best approach is to move right to access the rule blocks and see if I can create a new rule that makes the walls passable or changes the win condition to something closer.

I think I'll go with moving right first to get closer to the rule blocks. That way, I can start experimenting with the rules and see if I can find a shortcut or a new ability.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is positioned 1 step to the left and 2 steps up from my current position. There's also a ""rule `win`"" block 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might be important because if I can manipulate the win condition, I might be able to change how I win the level.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and a ""rule `wall`"" block 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. These could be used to change the properties of objects or create new rules.

Since I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar, I need to check if any of these rule blocks are movable. The ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step up, so I should avoid moving that unless I want to change its property.

My initial thought is to move towards the key because keys often unlock doors or change something in the level. The key is relatively close, so maybe I can pick it up and use it somewhere else. Alternatively, moving towards the ""rule `win`"" block could allow me to redefine the win condition, which might be necessary if the current path is blocked.

Another consideration is the ""rule `baba`"" block 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. If I can move this, I might be able to change what Baba is, which could give me new abilities or change how I interact with the environment.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" block 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Maybe manipulating this could introduce a ball into the level, which could be used to push objects or reach areas I can't get to otherwise.

Given that the key is closer, I think moving towards it first might be the best approach. Once I have the key, I can look for a door or another rule block that requires it. Alternatively, if I can't reach the key immediately, I might need to rearrange some rule blocks to create a path.

Wait, but I'm currently at a position where I can move up, right, down, or left. The key is 1 step left and 2 steps up, so I need to plan a path to get there without hitting any walls. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: let's say (0,0).
- Key is at (-1, 2).
- Walls are at (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (3,-2), (3,-3), (3,-4).
- The ""rule `win`"" is at (8,2), which is far to the right.
- The ""rule `is`"" blocks are at (7,2), (1,-1), (1,-4).
- The ""rule `wall`"" is at (-2,1).
- The ""rule `stop`"" is at (1,1).
- The ""rule `baba`"" is at (-2,-4).
- The ""rule `you`"" is at (0,-4).
- The ""rule `ball`"" is at (6,-4).

So, moving left and up towards the key seems possible, but I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. From (0,0), moving left to (-1,0) and then up to (-1,1) and (-1,2) where the key is. Are there any walls in that area? The walls are mostly on the right side, so it seems clear.

Therefore, my plan is to move left to (-1,0), then up twice to reach the key at (-1,2). Once I have the key, I can look for a door or another rule block that might require it to proceed further.

Alternatively, if moving towards the key isn't possible due to some rule I'm missing, I might need to adjust my approach. For example, if the key is behind a wall, I might need to move a rule block to change the wall's properties or remove it.

But based on the current information, moving left and then up seems feasible. So, I'll start by moving left to get closer to the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is two steps up, which might be important. There are several walls positioned around, which could block my path or be used to manipulate rules.

The rule blocks are crucial here. I see multiple ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules. There's also a ""win"" rule far to the right, which might be the target I need to reach. The ""wall"" and ""stop"" rules are nearby, which could affect how I move or what I can interact with.

I notice that the ""ball"" is positioned a bit down and to the left. Maybe I can use it somehow, but I'm not sure yet. The ""key"" is up, so perhaps I need to collect it to unlock something.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to be careful about walls and other objects. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and up, which might mean that if I move into that area, I could get stopped. I should avoid that unless I can change the rule.

I think the strategy here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Maybe I can move a ""stop"" rule away or create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see that there are multiple ""is"" blocks. If I can move a ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block, I might be able to create a new rule like ""wall is you,"" which would let me move through walls. Alternatively, I could try to change the win condition to something else if reaching the current win is too difficult.

I should also consider the key. If I can reach the key, maybe it can be used to unlock a door or change a rule. The key is two steps up, so I need to plan a path to get there without hitting any walls or getting stopped.

Let me visualize the map. The key is up, so I might need to move up first. But there are walls to the right, so I might have to go around. Alternatively, if I can change the rules to make walls passable, I can go straight through.

Another thought: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that might make it easier to reach. But moving rule blocks requires that they are not ""stop"" or similar. I need to check if the ""win"" rule is movable.

I think the best approach is to try to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. To do that, I need to move a ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block. Let me see where the ""wall"" rule is. It's one step to the left and one step up. If I can move that next to an ""is"" block, I can create ""wall is you"" or something similar.

But to move the ""wall"" rule, I need to be able to move it. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but the ""wall"" rule might be considered a wall itself, making it immovable. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I can change the rule so that walls are not stop. If I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I can move them. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to move through them as if they were Baba.

So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block. Let me see the positions. The ""wall"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. The nearest ""is"" block is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block closer.

Alternatively, I can move Baba to the position of the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""is"" block next to it. But moving the ""is"" block might be tricky because it's far away.

Another idea: maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. If I can move that next to an ""is"" block, I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But that might not help me reach the actual win object.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can make ""you is win,"" then reaching the ""you"" rule would make me win. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I think the key is to manipulate the walls. If I can make walls passable, I can move through them to reach the key and then the win. So, I need to create a rule that changes the wall's property.

Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move Baba to the position of the ""wall"" rule (one step left and one step up).
2. Then, move an ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is something.""
3. If I can make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you,"" that would help.

But moving the ""is"" block from 8 steps right and 2 steps up to next to the ""wall"" rule is a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule closer to an existing ""is"" block.

Alternatively, I can use the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and one step up. If I can move that, I can prevent walls from stopping me.

Wait, if I make ""stop is you,"" then I can move through stop blocks. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first and see if I can collect it without dealing with the walls. The key is two steps up, so I can try moving up twice.

But there might be walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions. There are walls at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is where the key is. So, moving up two steps would take me into a wall. That's a problem.

So, I need to find a way to pass through the wall. That brings me back to the idea of changing the wall's rule.

Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block. The ""wall"" rule is at (left 1, up 1). The nearest ""is"" block is at (right 8, up 2). That's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block closer.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to the position of an existing ""is"" block. But that might not be possible due to the distance.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at (left 1, down 1). If I can make ""ball is you,"" I can move as a ball, which might have different properties.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: the ""win"" rule is at (right 9, up 2). If I can reach that, I can win. But the path is blocked by walls. So, I need to find a way to get past the walls.

Perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. To do that, I need to move a ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block and then next to another property, like ""push"" or ""you.""

But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so maybe ""wall is you"" is the way to go.

Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move Baba to the ""wall"" rule's position: one step left and one step up.
2. Then, move an ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule. The closest ""is"" block is at (right 8, up 2). That's too far. Maybe I can move another ""is"" block that's closer.

Looking at the objects, there's an ""is"" rule at (left 1, down 1). If I can move that next to the ""wall"" rule, I can create ""wall is something.""

So, step 1: Move Baba to the ""wall"" rule's position: left 1, up 1.
Step 2: Move the ""is"" rule from (left 1, down 1) to next to the ""wall"" rule.

But how? The ""is"" rule is down, so I need to move it up.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule up to be next to the ""wall"" rule.

But moving rule blocks requires that they are not ""stop."" I think rule blocks can be moved as long as they're not defined as stop.

So, I can move the ""is"" rule from (left 1, down 1) up to (left 1, up 1), next to the ""wall"" rule.

Then, the rule becomes ""wall is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to move it further.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to the right next to the ""wall"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at (left 1, up 1). If I move the ""is"" rule from (left 1, down 1) to (left 1, up 1), they would be on the same spot, which isn't helpful.

Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to the right of the ""wall"" rule.

So, move the ""is"" rule from (left 1, down 1) to (right 0, up 1), which is next to the ""wall"" rule at (left 1, up 1). Then, the rule would be ""wall is is,"" which isn't useful.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Another idea: use the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at (right 7, down 1). If I can make ""key is you,"" I can collect the key and maybe unlock something.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the key's position. The key is two steps up, which is where the wall is. So, I need to get past the wall to reach the key.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at (right 7, down 4). If I can make ""ball is you,"" I can move like a ball, which might roll through walls.

But I'm not sure how that works in this game. Maybe it's worth a try.

Alternatively, I can try to break the existing rules. For example, if I can separate ""baba is you,"" I can change what I control.

But that might not be necessary. Let me focus on making walls passable.

I think the best way is to create ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you."" Since I don't see a ""push"" rule, I'll aim for ""wall is you.""

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block and then next to a ""you"" rule.

The ""you"" rule is at (right 1, down 4). So, if I can move the ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block and then next to ""you,"" I can create ""wall is you.""

But that's a lot of steps. Let me see if I can move the ""wall"" rule closer.

The ""wall"" rule is at (left 1, up 1). The nearest ""is"" block is at (left 1, down 1). If I move the ""is"" block up to (left 1, up 1), they would overlap, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right to meet an ""is"" block.

The ""is"" block at (right 8, up 2) is too far. Maybe I can move another ""is"" block.

Wait, there's an ""is"" block at (right 1, down 4). If I can move that next to the ""wall"" rule, I can create ""wall is something.""

But moving that ""is"" block from (right 1, down 4) to (left 1, up 1) is a long distance. I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for other rule blocks that can help.

I see a ""stop"" rule at (right 1, up 1). If I can make ""stop is you,"" I can move through stop blocks. But I'm not sure if that helps with walls.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""stop is push,"" but again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I can make ""ball is you,"" I can move as a ball, which might have different movement properties, like rolling through walls.

But I'm not sure how that works. Let me try to plan that.

1. Move Baba to the ""ball"" rule's position: left 1, down 1.
2. Then, move an ""is"" block next to the ""ball"" rule to create ""ball is you.""

But the ""is"" block is at (left 1, down 1), so moving it next to ""ball"" would be the same spot. Maybe I need to move another ""is"" block.

Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" rule next to an ""is"" block.

The ""ball"" rule is at (right 7, down 4). The nearest ""is"" block is at (right 8, up 2). That's too far.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to reach the key first and see if it helps.

The key is two steps up, but that's where the wall is. So, I need to get past the wall. Let me try to move up and see if I can break through.

Wait, if I try to move up into the wall, I'll be stopped. So, I need to find a way to make the wall passable.

I think the only way is to change the wall's rule. So, I need to create ""wall is you"" or ""wall is push.""

Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" block.

The ""wall"" rule is at (left 1, up 1). The nearest ""is"" block is at (left 1, down 1). If I can move the ""is"" block up to (left 1, up 1), they would overlap, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right to meet an ""is"" block.

The ""is"" block at (right 8, up 2) is too far. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right step by step.

But moving the ""wall"" rule requires that it's not a stop. I think rule blocks can be moved as long as they're not defined as stop.

So, I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right. Let's say I move it right once, then again, until it's next to an ""is"" block.

But that would take several steps, and I'm not sure if that's the best use of my moves.

Alternatively, I can try to move an ""is"" block closer to the ""wall"" rule.

The ""is"" block at (right 1, down 4) is closer. If I can move that up to (right 1, up 1), then I can have ""wall is is,"" which isn't helpful. Maybe I need to move it further.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" block from (right 1, down 4) to (right 1, up 1), then I can have ""wall is is."" Not useful. Maybe I need to move it to the left.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block from (right 1, down 4) to (left 1, up 1), next to the ""wall"" rule.

That would require moving it left 2 steps and up 5 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Once the ""is"" block is next to the ""wall"" rule, I can create ""wall is something."" Then, I need to move another rule block next to it to complete the rule.

For example, if I have ""wall is you,"" then walls become passable.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move the ""is"" block from (right 1, down 4) to (left 1, up 1), next to the ""wall"" rule.
2. Then, move the ""you"" rule from (right 1, down 4) to (left 1, up 2), completing the rule ""wall is you.""

But moving the ""you"" rule might be tricky. Let me check where the ""you"" rule is. It's at (right 1, down 4). So, moving it to (left 1, up 2) would require moving it left 2 steps and up 6 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, I can use another rule block. For example, if I have ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I make ""stop is you,"" I can move through stop blocks, but I'm not sure if that helps with walls.

I think the best bet is to create ""wall is you."" So, I need to move the ""is"" block and the ""you"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a quicker way.

Another idea: use the ""key"" rule. If I can make ""key is you,"" I can collect the key and maybe unlock a path.

The ""key"" rule is at (right 7, down 1). If I can move that next to an ""is"" block, I can create ""key is you.""

But moving the ""key"" rule is far. Maybe I can move an ""is"" block to it.

The ""is"" block at (right 8, up 2) is close to the ""key"" rule. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to that ""is"" block, I can create ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, if I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, which might not help. Alternatively, ""key is win"" would make the key the win condition.

But I need to reach the key first. Let me see if I can get past the wall to reach the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, a ball, and several walls. There are also rule blocks scattered around. The key is two steps up, which might be important. The walls are positioned in a way that could be blocking my path or the path to the win condition.

I notice there are multiple rule blocks: ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These can be moved to create or change rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule block next to something else, I might change what counts as winning.

The ball is one step to the left and one step down. Maybe it's part of a mechanism I can use. The walls are in various positions, some of which might be movable if I can change their properties.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the win condition something I can reach. Maybe I can make the ball the win condition or change the rules so that I can move through walls.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule block one step to the right and one step up. If I can move that, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving or affecting me.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rule blocks. Maybe I can create a new rule by combining them with other objects. For example, if I move an ""is"" block next to ""win,"" I could potentially change the win condition.

Let me try to visualize the map. The key is two steps up, so I should move towards it. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock something or change a rule involving the key.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" block to the ball's position, then reaching the ball would make me win. That might be a way to bypass walls or other obstacles.

I should also consider the ""baba"" and ""you"" rule blocks. If I can change the ""baba is you"" rule, I might gain new abilities or change my properties.

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to create a new rule. For example, ""baba is key"" would make me the key, allowing me to interact with locks or other key-dependent objects.

Wait, there's a ""key"" rule block seven steps to the right and one step down. If I can move that next to ""is,"" I could create a rule like ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key.

But how do I get to the key? It's two steps up, but there might be walls blocking me. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being solid, allowing me to pass through them.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule block to change the properties of walls. If I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop moving, but I'm not sure if that helps.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. Let me try moving up twice to reach the key. Once I have the key, I can see if there's a lock or another rule involving the key that I can exploit.

If moving up doesn't work because of walls, I might need to change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule next to a wall could make it stop being a wall, allowing me to pass.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current rule blocks.

Wait, there's a ""you"" rule block four steps down. If I can move that next to ""is"" and another object, I could change what ""you"" is. For example, ""you is win"" would make me the win condition, so I just need to be somewhere specific.

I think I'll start by moving towards the key. Let me try moving up twice to see if I can reach it. If that's blocked, I'll look into changing the rules to remove the obstacles.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule block to the ball's position, then reaching the ball would make me win. That might be a quicker path.

I'm a bit confused about the exact positions, but I think moving towards the key is a good starting point. Let me try moving up twice.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is 1 step up, so it's directly above me. There are walls to the right and down, which might block my path. The rule blocks are positioned at various points, some of which might be useful for changing the rules.

I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" block 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's pretty far, but maybe I can move it closer. Also, there's a ""rule `key`"" block 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the key do something else or make it part of a new rule.

Since I'm Baba and can move around, I should see if I can reach any rule blocks to change the rules. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered, which might allow me to create new rules by moving them next to other objects or words.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step to the right. If I move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or prevent certain actions. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball do something, like become a key or a win condition, that could help. But I'm not sure how to utilize that yet.

I think the key is the most immediate object. If I can pick it up or use it somehow, maybe it will open a path or change the rules. But since I'm Baba, I can only interact with objects by moving them if they're not stopped.

Looking at the walls, they're mostly to the right and down, which might block my path to the rule blocks. I need to find a way to move around them or change their properties.

Perhaps I should try moving towards the key first. If I go up, I can reach the key. Then, maybe I can move the key to a rule block to create a new rule, like ""key is win"" or something similar. That could change the win condition to the key, making it easier to win.

Alternatively, I could try moving a ""rule `is`"" block next to another object to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" and another object could redefine what wins the level.

But I'm not sure if moving the key is the best first step. Maybe I should first check if there are any rule blocks I can easily access to change the rules in my favor.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is 1 step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, making walls stop being solid or something. But I'm not sure how that would help.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move towards the key. If I can get the key, maybe it will help me unlock something or change the rules to make winning easier.

So, I'll try moving up to get the key. Once I have the key, I can see if I can use it to interact with any rule blocks.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, but I need to figure out how.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is two steps up, which might be important. There are also several rule blocks like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and two steps up. If I can get to that, maybe I can change the win condition. But first, I need to figure out how to move around. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless there are walls or other rules stopping me.

The walls are placed in a way that might block my path. I see walls at various positions, so I need to navigate around them. The ball is one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something, but I'm not sure yet.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to something else, I might change what counts as winning. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba into something else by rearranging the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can stop certain objects or myself. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Let me try to visualize the map. The key is two steps up, so I should move up to get it. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock something. But I need to see if there are any locked doors or other objects that require the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to change a rule. For example, if I move the key next to a rule, it might alter that rule. I'm not entirely sure how that works, though.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can combine them with other words to create new rules. For example, if I put ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then ""win,"" that would make ""baba is win,"" which might make Baba the win condition.

But wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I change it to ""baba is win,"" then reaching Baba would win the level. That could be useful.

To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and then next to ""win."" Let me see where those are. The ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and six steps down. The ""is"" rule is six steps down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and two steps up.

Hmm, that's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" But that might take a lot of steps.

Another idea: if I can make ""you"" into something else, like ""you is win,"" then reaching myself would win. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is one step to the right and six steps down. If I can move that next to ""is"" and then next to ""win,"" I could create ""you is win."" That might be easier since I'm already controlling Baba, which is ""you.""

But how do I move the rules? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. So I need to check if the rules are movable. I think in Baba Is You, rule blocks can be moved by pushing them with the player.

So, I can move the ""is"" rule by pushing it. Let me try to move towards the ""is"" rule. It's eight steps to the right and two steps up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I should first move up to get the key, which is two steps up.

Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock a path or change a rule. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, I can use the key to move a rule block.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to change the ""stop"" rule. If I move the key next to ""stop,"" it might change the rule to ""key is stop,"" making the key immovable. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it might make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the win condition. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" If I can do that, then ""baba is win"" would be the new rule, and reaching Baba would win the level.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's nine steps to the right and two steps up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move right step by step, pushing the ""win"" rule as I go.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to win without moving so much. For example, if I can make ""you is win,"" then I just need to be somewhere, which I already am.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is one step to the right and six steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and then next to ""win,"" I can create ""you is win."" That would mean that wherever I am, I win.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's eight steps to the right and two steps up. I need to get there. Let me plan my path.

First, I'll move up two steps to get the key. Then, I can use the key to move other rule blocks. Once I have the key, I can move the ""is"" rule towards ""you.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is. But that might be complicated.

Another idea: if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball can be the win condition. But I'm not sure where the ball is. It's one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe I can move the ball next to ""is"" and then next to ""win.""

But that might take too long. I think the quickest way is to make ""you is win."" So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you.""

Let me try to move right step by step, pushing the ""is"" rule as I go. Each time I move right, I can push the ""is"" rule one step. It's a bit tedious, but it might work.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push the ""is"" rule. But I'm not sure how the ball moves. It might just roll down unless there's a slope.

Wait, the ball is one step to the left and three steps down. If I can move the ball next to a slope, it might roll towards the ""is"" rule. But I don't see any slopes mentioned.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" to create ""you is win."" That way, I can win by being where I am.

So, I'll start moving right towards the ""is"" rule. Each step right will bring me closer. Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can push it towards ""you.""

But I need to make sure I don't get blocked by walls. Let me check the walls. There are walls at various positions, but I think I can navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the walls to create a path. But that might complicate things.

I think the key is to focus on moving the ""is"" rule next to ""you."" Once that's done, I can win by being in the same spot.

So, I'll start moving right step by step, pushing the ""is"" rule as I go. It might take a few steps, but it's the most straightforward approach.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's probably near me. There are walls to the right, which might block my path. The rules are spread out, some to the right and some down.

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. So maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the walls passable or change the win condition.

First, I should figure out where I am. Since the key is one step to the left, I must be near it. Maybe I can pick it up. But I need to see if I can move towards it. The walls are three steps to the right, so they might be in the way if I try to go right.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step down. That means if I move down, I might hit a stop block, which would prevent me from moving further in that direction. I should avoid that unless I can change it.

The rule ""wall"" is two steps to the left and one step down. So if I move left twice and down once, I can find the wall rule. Maybe I can move that rule to change how walls behave.

The rule ""is"" is seven steps to the right. That's a long way. Maybe I can move towards it to create a new rule. Similarly, the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can get to that, I might change the win condition.

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. Maybe it's part of a puzzle where I need to move it somewhere.

I think the key is important. If I can pick it up, maybe it can unlock something. But I need to get to it. Since it's one step to the left, I can try moving left. But I need to check if there are any walls or stops in that direction.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step down, but I'm not sure about the left direction. Maybe moving left is safe. Let me try moving left to pick up the key.

After moving left, I have the key. Now, what can I do with it? Maybe it's needed to open a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps it's for rearranging rules.

Looking back, the rule ""key"" is six steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move the key there, maybe it will create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something else useful.

But to get there, I need to move right six steps and down three. That seems complicated with walls in the way. Maybe I can change the walls into something else.

The rule ""wall"" is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, I can change how walls behave. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" I can push them, or ""wall is pass"" to walk through them.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I move it somewhere else, I can avoid being stopped when moving down.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. It's one step down. If I move it further down, I can prevent myself from being stopped when moving down. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I need to create that rule. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to Baba.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. That's a long way, but maybe I can move it closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to me, then ""baba is win"" would be created, and I can win immediately.

But moving the ""win"" rule eight steps to the right seems difficult. Maybe I can break it down into smaller steps. First, move it one step at a time towards me.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by combining existing elements. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something.""

Wait, the ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right. If I can move it next to ""win,"" which is eight steps to the right, I can create ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Another approach: use the key to move a rule. Since I have the key, maybe I can use it to pick up a rule block. For example, moving the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" to make ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

Let me try that. I have the key, so if I can make ""key is win,"" then when I pick up the key, I win. But I already have the key, so maybe that's not necessary.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. That way, I can win by being myself.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule eight steps to the right towards me. But that's a lot. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I move right, I can get closer to it. But there are walls three steps to the right. So I can't move right beyond that unless I change the walls.

Maybe I can change the walls into something passable. The ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, I can change how walls behave.

For example, if I make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can use myself as a key to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked.

Wait, the key is one step to the left. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. Let me try that.

To make ""key is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and three steps down. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and two steps up. That seems complicated.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure how to do that without moving too many steps.

Maybe I should focus on moving the ""win"" rule closer to me. If I can move it to my position, then ""baba is win"" would be created, and I can win.

But moving the ""win"" rule eight steps to the right is a lot. Maybe I can move it one step at a time. For example, move it left one step, then left again, until it's next to me.

But I need to see if I can move the ""win"" rule. It's eight steps to the right and two steps up. So it's above me. Maybe I can move up to reach it, but there are walls in the way.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step down. If I move down, I might hit a stop block. I should avoid that unless I can change it.

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. It's one step down. If I can move it further down, I can prevent myself from being stopped when moving down.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to another rule to change its behavior.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls and reach the ""win"" rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving another rule.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and six steps down. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is push,"" I can push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to me. That would allow me to win immediately.

But how can I move the ""win"" rule? It's eight steps to the right and two steps up. I need to get there, but walls are blocking me.

Maybe I can move the walls by changing their rules. If I can make walls passable, I can move through them to reach the ""win"" rule.

So, let's try that. The ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule to say ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""pass."" But I don't have a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving another rule.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and six steps down. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is,"" I can make ""ball is pass."" Then, the ball can be used to pass through walls.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on making walls passable directly.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. It's one step down. If I can move it further down, I can avoid being stopped when moving down.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to another rule to change its behavior.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win immediately. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to me.

But the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and two steps up. I need to find a way to move it closer.

Wait, maybe I can break the ""win"" rule into smaller parts. If I can move the ""win"" rule one step at a time towards me, I can eventually make ""baba is win.""

But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a faster way.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by combining existing elements. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

The key is one step to the left, so if I can make ""key is win,"" I can win by picking up the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and three steps down. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and two steps up. That seems complicated.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to both ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure how to do that without moving too many steps.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can use myself as a key to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked.

12,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is one step to the left, so it's probably near me. There are walls to the right, which might block my path. The rules are positioned at various points, like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. So, maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the key or another object winnable. The key is at (left 1), so I can move towards it. But I need to see if there are any obstacles or if I can change the rules to make the key the win condition.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can bring it closer. Alternatively, I can make the key the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule next to the key. But how?

I can move the ""win"" rule to the key's position. The key is at (left 1), so I need to move the ""win"" rule from (8 right, 2 up) to (left 1). That would make the key the win condition. But how do I do that? I can move the ""win"" rule by moving it step by step, but I need to check if there are any walls blocking the path.

Looking at the walls, there are walls at (3 right, 2 up), (3 right, 1 up), (3 right), (3 right, 1 down), (3 right, 2 down), (3 right, 3 down), (3 right, 4 down), (3 right, 5 down), and (3 right, 6 down). So, the right side is mostly blocked. Maybe I can go down first to avoid the walls.

I'm currently at the starting position. The key is to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. But I need to see if moving left is possible. There's a wall two steps to the left and one step up, but I'm not sure about the exact position. Maybe I can move left once to get the key.

Alternatively, I can try to change the rules to make the key winnable. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key, then picking up the key would win the level. So, I need to plan how to move the ""win"" rule.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires moving it step by step, which might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a quicker way. Alternatively, I can make the key the win condition by creating a new rule like ""key is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 2 up). So, if I can move the ""is"" rule to the key's position and then move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can move it by moving it step by step. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking the path. The ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 2 up), which is far to the right. There are walls at (3 right, 2 up), so maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to avoid them.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the key is. The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up). If I move it down, I can bring it closer to the key. But I need to see if there are any walls in the way.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (1 step down). That might block movement. I need to be careful not to step on it. Maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, I can make the key winnable by creating a new rule. Let me think: if I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key, then the key becomes the win condition. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule from (8 right, 2 up) to the key's position at (left 1).

But moving the ""win"" rule that far might not be feasible due to walls. Maybe I can break down the movement into smaller steps. First, move the ""win"" rule down to avoid the walls, then left towards the key.

Alternatively, I can make the key the win condition by using the existing rules. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key and then move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, I can create ""key is win.""

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from (7 right, 2 up) to the key's position (left 1). But that's a long way. Maybe I can move it down first.

2. Once the ""is"" rule is next to the key, move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule to form ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule that far. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key directly.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up). The key is at (left 1). So, I need to move the ""win"" rule left 9 steps and down 2 steps. But that's a lot, and there are walls in the way.

Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the key and then the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. Let's see:

- Move the ""is"" rule from (7 right, 2 up) to (left 1, 2 up). But that's still 8 steps left, which might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule down to avoid walls. Let's say I move it down 2 steps to (7 right, 0). Then, move it left 8 steps to (left 1, 0). Then, move the ""win"" rule from (8 right, 2 up) to (left 1, 0) as well, forming ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible due to walls. Maybe I can find a path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule down to where the key is. The key is at (left 1), so if I can move the ""win"" rule down to (left 1, 0), that would make the key winnable.

But how? The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up). I need to move it left 9 steps and down 2 steps. That's a lot, and there are walls in the way.

Maybe I can break it down:

1. Move the ""win"" rule down 2 steps to (8 right, 0).

2. Then, move it left 8 steps to (0, 0).

3. Then, move it left 1 step to (-1, 0), which is the key's position.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. There might be walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and then the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule.

Let me try that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from (7 right, 2 up) down 2 steps to (7 right, 0).

2. Then, move it left 8 steps to (-1, 0), which is the key's position.

3. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the key, forming ""key is [something].""

4. Then, move the ""win"" rule from (8 right, 2 up) down 2 steps to (8 right, 0).

5. Then, move it left 9 steps to (-1, 0), forming ""key is win.""

That would make the key the win condition. Then, I can just pick up the key to win.

But I need to check if moving the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule that far is possible without hitting walls.

Looking at the walls, there are walls at (3 right, 2 up), (3 right, 1 up), (3 right), (3 right, 1 down), (3 right, 2 down), (3 right, 3 down), (3 right, 4 down), (3 right, 5 down), and (3 right, 6 down). So, the right side is mostly blocked beyond 3 steps.

The ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 2 up). To move it down to (7 right, 0), I need to move it down 2 steps. But there's a wall at (3 right, 2 up), so moving down from (7 right, 2 up) might be blocked by walls at (7 right, 1 up) and (7 right, 0). Wait, no, the walls are at (3 right, ...), so beyond that, it's clear.

Wait, the walls are at (3 right, 2 up), (3 right, 1 up), etc., but the ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 2 up). So, moving down from there, there are no walls at (7 right, 1 up) or (7 right, 0). So, I can move the ""is"" rule down 2 steps to (7 right, 0).

Then, moving it left 8 steps to (-1, 0). That's possible because there are no walls in that path.

Once the ""is"" rule is at (-1, 0), next to the key, then I can move the ""win"" rule from (8 right, 2 up) down 2 steps to (8 right, 0), then left 9 steps to (-1, 0). That would form ""key is win.""

Then, I can move to the key's position and win.

So, the steps are:

1. Move the ""is"" rule down 2 steps.

2. Move the ""is"" rule left 8 steps.

3. Move the ""win"" rule down 2 steps.

4. Move the ""win"" rule left 9 steps.

But I need to do this step by step, making sure each move is valid.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule first.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up). If I move it down 2 steps to (8 right, 0), then left 9 steps to (-1, 0), that would make it next to the key. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Since the walls are at (3 right, ...), moving left from (8 right, 0) to (-1, 0) should be possible because there are no walls beyond (3 right).

So, maybe I can:

1. Move the ""win"" rule down 2 steps.

2. Move the ""win"" rule left 9 steps to (-1, 0), next to the key.

Then, the key becomes the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""win"" rule left 9 steps is possible. Since there are no walls beyond (3 right), it should be possible.

Once the ""win"" rule is next to the key, the key becomes the win condition. Then, I can move to the key's position and win.

So, the actions would be:

1. Move the ""win"" rule down 2 steps.

2. Move the ""win"" rule left 9 steps.

But I need to output a single action. Wait, no, the user is asking for a single action each time. So, I need to choose one action now.

Given that, maybe the best first step is to move the ""win"" rule down 2 steps.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule first.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down 2 steps first.

So, the first action would be to move the ""is"" rule down 2 steps.

But how do I represent that? The actions are ""idle,"" ""up,"" ""right,"" ""down,"" ""left."" So, I need to choose one of these.

Wait, no, the actions are the movement commands for Baba. So, I need to move Baba to pick up the ""is"" rule or the ""win"" rule.

Wait, no, in the game, you can move text blocks by moving into them. So, to move the ""is"" rule, I need to move Baba next to it and then move into it to pick it up, then move it to the desired position.

So, first, I need to move Baba to the position of the ""is"" rule.

The ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 2 up). So, I need to move right 7 steps and up 2 steps.

But that's a lot, and there are walls in the way. Let me check the path.

From the starting position, moving right 3 steps is blocked by walls. So, I can't go beyond 3 right. Therefore, I can't reach the ""is"" rule directly.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up). Similarly, I can't reach it directly because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move down first to avoid the walls. Let me see.

If I move down, I can go below the walls. Let's see:

From the starting position, moving down 1 step takes me to (0, -1). Then, I can move right beyond the walls.

So, the plan is:

1. Move down to (0, -1).

2. Move right to (8 right, -1), which is where the ""win"" rule is, but it's at (8 right, 2 up). Wait, no, the ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up), so moving down won't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1 step down). If I can move it, I can clear the path.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule to make some walls passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at (2 left, 1 down). If I can move it, I can change the properties of walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can make walls passable by changing the rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at (7 right, 6 down). Not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make the key winnable by using the existing rules. If I can move the key next to the ""win"" rule, then the key becomes winnable.

But the key is at (left 1), and the ""win"" rule is at (8 right, 2 up). So, I need to move the key 9 steps right and 2 up, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key.

But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can break the walls by changing the rules. If I can make walls passable, I can move through them.

The ""wall"" rule is at (2 left, 1 down). If I can move it, I can change the wall properties.

For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But they already do. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control walls, but that might not help.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't think that's possible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1 step down). If I can move it next to a wall, then that wall becomes stop, but they already are.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key winnable by using the ""is"" rule.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key and then the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, I can create ""key is win.""

But I can't reach the ""is"" rule because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to avoid the walls.

The ""is"" rule is at (7 right, 2 up). If I can move it down 2 steps to (7 right, 0), then left 8 steps to (-1, 0), next to the key.

But I can't reach the ""is"" rule because of the walls at (3 right, ...).

So, maybe I need to find another approach.

Wait, maybe I can make the key winnable by using the existing rules. If I can move the key next to the ""win"" rule, but that's too far.

Alternatively, I can make the key winnable by using the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule.

But I can't reach them because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1 step down). If I can move it somewhere else, I can clear the path.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at (7 right, 6 down). Not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make the key winnable by using the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule, but I need to find a way to move them.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key winnable by using the ""you"" rule.

The ""you"" rule is at (4 steps down). If I can move it next to the key, then the key becomes me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, I can make the key winnable by using the ""baba"" rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at (2 left, 6 down). If I can move it next to the key, then the key becomes Baba, but that might not help.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1 step down). If I can move it next to a wall, then that wall becomes stop, but they already are.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop""","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's somewhere near me. There are walls to the right and down, which might block my path. The rules are spread out, and I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might be important because if I can change the win condition, I could win by reaching that rule.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop or change its behavior. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down, but I'm not sure how that helps yet.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and two steps up. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and three steps down. Hmm, that's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule next to something else. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and two steps up. If I can bring it next to the ""key,"" that might set ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule directly. Maybe I need to break apart existing rules first. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I might be able to create space to move other rules around.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and one step down. If I move that, maybe I can make a path for myself. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea: since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I should move towards the key first. The key is one step to the left, so I can go left. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking me. The walls are to the right and down, so maybe moving left is safe.

If I move left, I can pick up the key. But how does that help? Unless I can create a rule that makes the key the win condition. So, after picking up the key, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule to make ""key is win."" Then, having the key would make me win.

But I'm not sure if I can carry the key and move rules at the same time. Maybe I need to first move the ""is"" rule into position before picking up the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key. If I can get the ""win"" rule next to the key, then ""key is win"" would be created, and picking up the key would win the level.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's eight steps to the right and two steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move towards it step by step.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move up, down, left, or right. Let me plan my movements. I need to get closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.

First, I'll move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move right towards it. Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up and move it next to the ""key"" rule to create ""key is win.""

But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls. The walls are to the right and down, so moving up and right should be safe.

Let me try moving up first. That should bring me closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move right towards it.

After moving up, I'll be in a better position to handle the rules. Maybe I can then move the ""is"" rule into place to create the necessary rule.

Alternatively, if moving up doesn't help, I might need to move left to get the key first. But I think manipulating the rules is more important.

I'm a bit confused about the exact positions, but moving up seems like a good start to access the rules I need.

I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might be the win condition. To get there, I need to move right and up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break or move some walls by changing the rules.

I see a ""rule `stop`"" one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. Or perhaps I can change the ""baba is you"" rule to something else to gain abilities. Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get to the key, which is to the left. Then, maybe use the key to unlock something. But I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Alternatively, I can try to manipulate the rules directly.

I see a ""rule `is`"" 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that closer, I might be able to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then Baba becomes the win condition, and I can just reach myself.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" So I need to check if the rules are movable. Since they're text blocks, I think they can be moved.

Let me plan my moves. I need to move right to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, maybe up to position it correctly. Alternatively, I can move left to get the key first, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the key is only one step to the left. Maybe I can pick it up and use it to unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned. Maybe the key is for a different purpose.

Alternatively, I can focus on moving the ""is"" rule. If I can bring it next to ""baba,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition, so I just need to reach myself, which I already am. Hmm, that might not help.

Wait, no. If ""baba is win,"" then whenever I reach the ""WIN"" object, I win. But I need to get to the ""WIN"" rule, which is 8 steps to the right and 2 up. So maybe I should focus on moving towards that.

But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can change the wall rules. There's a ""rule `wall`"" 2 steps to the left and 1 down. If I can move that, perhaps I can make walls stop being solid.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I can make walls stop, then they won't block me. But I'm not sure how that works.

Let me try to move right first. If I move right, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule. Then, I can try to create a new rule that helps me bypass the walls.

So, my first move should be to the right. That way, I can start positioning myself to manipulate the necessary rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is two steps to the left, and there are walls in various positions. The rules include ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

Hmm, the key is two steps to the left. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But before that, I should see if I can move freely. The walls are placed in a way that might block my path, but since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have a ""stop"" property.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left and one step down. That might mean that if I move in that direction, I'll hit a stop, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to be careful about that.

The ""win"" rule is seven steps to the right. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But how? There are walls in the way. Maybe I can break a rule or create a new one to change the properties of the walls or myself.

Looking at the rules, I see ""wall is stop"" two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what a wall is. For example, if I move the ""is"" or ""stop"" parts, I could redefine walls to not stop me.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba is you"" rule to change what Baba is. If I make Baba something else, maybe I can pass through walls or other obstacles.

The ball is three steps to the left and three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something, but I'm not sure yet.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. If I can pick up the key, it might help me unlock a path or change a rule. So, I'll move left twice to get the key.

Wait, but moving left might take me towards the ""stop"" rule. I need to check the exact positions. The key is two steps to the left, and the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left and one step down. So, if I move left twice, I might end up next to the stop, but I'm not sure if that affects me yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up or down to avoid the stop. But I'm not sure where that leads. Let me try moving left twice to get the key and see what happens.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's near me. There are walls to the right and down, which might block my path. The rules are spread out, and I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might be important because if I can change the win condition, I might win without reaching the usual ""WIN"" object.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" one step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop or change its behavior. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. I'm not sure if the ball is relevant here, but it's good to note.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The walls are in the way, so maybe I need to break a rule or create a new one to move past them. The key is close, so maybe I should pick it up first. But how does the key help? In some levels, keys open doors, but I don't see any doors here. Maybe the key is part of a rule that I can use to change something else.

I also see multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks. These are probably used to create new rules. If I can move a ""rule `is`"" next to another object, I can form a new rule. For example, if I move ""rule `is`"" next to ""key,"" I can make ""key is something,"" which might change the key's properties.

Let me think about the win condition. The ""rule `win`"" is far to the right. If I can move that closer or change what counts as winning, I might not have to go all the way there. Maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" That would make me the win condition, so I could win immediately.

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" blocks. I'm currently at the starting position, so I need to move towards the right to reach those rules. However, there are walls blocking my path. Maybe I can break a wall by changing its rule. If I can make a wall stop being a wall, I can pass through.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `stop`"" to make something stop, but I'm not sure how that would help yet. Maybe if I stop a wall, I can move through it.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and maybe use it to change another rule. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the key is only one step to the left. Maybe I should move left to pick it up. But then, how does that help me? I need to see if the key is part of a rule that can change something else.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move right to reach the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" blocks.
3. Try to form a new rule, like ""baba is win,"" to make myself the win condition.

But I'm blocked by walls. So maybe I need to break a wall first. How can I do that? If I can change a wall's rule, I can make it not a wall anymore.

Looking at the walls, there's a ""rule `wall`"" two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, I might be able to change the wall's properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but that's already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move a wall's rule to make it something else. But I'm not sure how to do that without more information.

Another approach: since the ""rule `stop`"" is one step up, maybe I can move it to stop a wall. If I can make a wall stop, I can pass through it. But I'm not sure how to apply that.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" next to a wall to make it stop being a wall. If I can do that, I can create a path.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""rule `stop`"" because it's one step up, which might be blocked by a wall. I need to see if I can reach it.

Let me try to plan my movements:

- Move up to reach the ""rule `stop`."" But is there a wall blocking me? The observation says there's a wall three steps to the right and one step up. So, if I move up, I might hit a wall. Maybe I can move right first to get around.

Wait, the walls are three steps to the right and various steps up and down. I'm at the starting position, so moving right might take me into walls. Maybe I need to move left first to get around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to avoid the walls. But moving down might take me further away from the rules I need.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" blocks. They are 7 and 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's a long way, but maybe I can find a path.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The ""rule `win`"" is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So they are next to each other. If I can reach them, I can form a new rule.

But how? The walls are in the way. Maybe I can break a wall by changing its rule.

Let me think: if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" two steps to the left and one step down, I can change it. For example, if I move ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `wall`,"" I can make ""wall is something."" Maybe ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Or ""wall is you,"" which would make the wall me, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing ones.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that next to ""rule `win`,"" I can make ""win is something."" Maybe ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition.

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" blocks. I'm not sure how to do that without moving through walls.

Maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to stop a wall, allowing me to pass. But I'm not sure how to apply that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key to create a new rule. The key is one step to the left. If I can move it next to ""rule `is`,"" I can make ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

Wait, that's a good idea. If I can make ""key is win,"" then when I pick up the key, I win. So how can I do that?

I need to move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""key"" and ""win."" But the ""rule `is`"" is far to the right, and the key is to the left. That might be difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" next to the key. But the ""rule `win`"" is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is far.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" blocks, even if it takes some steps. Let me try to plan a path.

I'm at the starting position. To reach the ""rule `is`"" at 7 right and 2 up, I need to move right 7 times and up 2 times. But there are walls in the way. Let me see:

- Moving right 3 steps, there's a wall. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I can go up first.

If I move up, I might hit a wall. The wall is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I move up, I can't go further right because of the wall.

Alternatively, I can move down to avoid the walls. But moving down takes me away from the rules.

Wait, maybe I can move left first to get around. The key is one step to the left. If I move left, I can pick up the key, but I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to get to the ""rule `wall`"" which is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can change that rule, I might be able to pass through walls.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the win condition again. If I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win immediately. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But the ""rule `is`"" is far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" next to me. But it's 8 steps to the right and 2 up, which is too far.

Wait, maybe I can break the walls by changing their rules. If I can make a wall stop being a wall, I can pass through.

The ""rule `wall`"" is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" one step up to stop a wall. But I'm not sure how to apply that.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""rule `is`"" and see if I can form a new rule on the way.

Let me try to move right as much as possible. I can move right 3 steps, but then there's a wall. So I can't go further right. Maybe I can move up to go around.

If I move up, I might hit a wall. The wall is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So moving up from my current position would take me into the wall. That's not good.

Alternatively, I can move down to avoid the wall. But moving down takes me further away from the rules I need.

Wait, maybe I can move left first to get to the ""rule `wall`"" and change it. If I can make the wall stop being a wall, I can pass through.

So, moving left one step to pick up the key. Then, maybe move left again to reach the ""rule `wall`."" But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left and then up to reach the ""rule `stop`."" But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""rule `is`"" and see what happens. Let me try to move right as much as possible.

I move right 3 steps, but then I hit a wall. So I can't go further right. Maybe I can move up to go around, but that's blocked too.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps I can use the key to open something, but I don't see any locks. Maybe the key is part of a rule that can change something else.

Wait, the key is one step to the left. If I can move the ""rule `is`"" next to the key, I can make ""key is something."" Maybe ""key is win,"" so picking up the key would make me win.

But the ""rule `is`"" is far to the right. I can't reach it because of the walls. So maybe I need to break a wall first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to stop a wall, allowing me to pass. But I'm not sure how to do that.

This is really frustrating. I'm stuck because the walls are blocking my path to the rules I need. Maybe I need to find a way to change the rules without moving through the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to stop a wall, making it passable. If I can do that, I can move through the wall.

But how? The ""rule `stop`"" is one step up. If I can move it next to a wall, I can make that wall stop, which might make it passable.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can try moving up to reach the ""rule `stop`"" and then move it next to a wall.

Let me try that. I move up one step to reach the ""rule `stop`."" Now, I can pick it up. Then, I move it next to a wall. For example, I can move it to the wall that's three steps to the right and one step up.

By placing ""rule `stop`"" next to that wall, I can make ""wall is stop,"" which is already the case. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing"" by combining rules, but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""rule `stop`"" with something else. For example, if I make ""stop is win,"" then stopping would make me win. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the win condition again.

If I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win immediately. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But the ""rule `is`"" is far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" next to me. But it's 8 steps to the right and 2 up, which is too far.

Wait, maybe I can break the walls by changing their rules. If I can make a wall stop being a wall, I can pass through.

The ""rule `wall`"" is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" one step up to stop a wall. But I'm not sure how to apply that.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""rule `is`"" and see if I can form a new rule on the way.

Let me try to move right as much as possible. I can move right 3 steps, but then there's a wall. So I can't go further right. Maybe I can move up to go around, but that's blocked too.

Wait, maybe I can move left first to get around. The key is one step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up, but I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to get to the ""rule `wall`"" which is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can change that rule, I might be able to pass through walls.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's probably near me. There are walls in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are spread out, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That seems pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule to change the win condition or make something else winnable. The ""key"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move the key closer, maybe I can use it to unlock something.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 6 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break walls. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to avoid walls and stop blocks. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step down, so I should be careful not to step on that. 

Let me think about the possible actions: idle, up, right, down, left. I need to choose one. If I move right, I might get closer to the ""win"" rule or the ""key."" Moving up could help me avoid walls, but I'm not sure. Moving down might take me towards the ball or other rules. Left might bring me closer to the key.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so maybe I should move left to pick it up. If I have the key, perhaps I can unlock a path or change a rule. Alternatively, moving right could help me reach the win condition faster.

But I'm not sure if moving left is the best move. Maybe I should first try to move towards the win condition. Let me see: the win is 8 steps right and 2 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can create a new rule to make the win condition closer.

Alternatively, I can try to move towards the key first. If I move left, I can get the key, which might be useful. Let me try that.

So, I think moving left is the best first step to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There are walls all around, which could block my path, but maybe I can move some rules to change their properties.

I notice there are several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These can be moved to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""key"" next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I could make ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. That might be a way to win without reaching the default ""WIN"" object.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is 1 step to the left, but I'm currently where? Let me visualize the map. I'm probably near the center, with walls around me. To the right, there are more walls and rule blocks. To the left, there's the key and some other rules.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move around the walls. Alternatively, if I can change the rules to make walls passable, that would help. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but if I can change that, maybe I can walk through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make something else stop, allowing me to move through walls. Or perhaps I can make ""baba is key"" to turn myself into the key, which might let me interact with locks or other objects.

But let's focus on the immediate goal. I need to get to the key. Since the key is to the left, I should try moving left. But there might be walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, which is far from me. Another wall is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is also not directly blocking my path to the left.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That doesn't seem to block the left path. Maybe I can just move left. Let me try that.

If I move left, I can reach the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to open a door or change a rule. But I need to make sure that moving left is possible. Are there any walls or stop rules preventing me from moving left? The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down, which doesn't block my left movement.

So, the best course of action is to move left to get the key. That might set me up to change the win condition or unlock something else. Let me choose the ""left"" action.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, a wall, a ball, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the right, which might be useful for unlocking something. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible.

The rules are important here. There's a ""win"" rule 10 steps to the right, which suggests that moving towards the right could lead me to the win condition. The ""is"" rule is 9 steps to the right, so maybe I can manipulate that to change the rules in my favor.

I also notice a ""stop"" rule 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to prevent myself from being stopped by walls or other objects. The ""key"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which could be used to pick up the key if needed.

The ball is 3 steps down, and there's a ""ball"" rule 8 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change the rules when it's moved.

I think the best approach is to move towards the right since the win condition is far to the right. I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. That way, I can potentially change the rules to make the win condition easier to reach or modify other objects to help me.

So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move one step to the right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. There's also a ball 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Hmm, that's interesting. The walls are spread out, and there are several rule blocks like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball.""

I need to figure out how to move. The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. I can't move through walls or objects that are ""STOP."" So, I should probably move towards the key or the ball since they might be important.

Wait, the key is at 1 step left and 3 down. The ball is in the same area. Maybe I need to collect the key to unlock something. But how do I get there? Let me visualize the map.

Starting from my position, I can move left or right. If I move left, I might get closer to the key and the ball. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions. Walls are at 4 steps right, 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc. So, moving left might not be blocked immediately.

Alternatively, moving right could help me reach the rule blocks like ""is"" and ""win."" If I can manipulate those rules, I might change the game's mechanics. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then collecting the key would win the level.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should first try to collect the key. To do that, I need to move towards it. Let me plan the path. From my current position, moving left once would get me closer. Then, moving down three times to reach the key's location.

Wait, but there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' exact positions. Walls are at 4 steps right and various down steps. So, moving left from my position might not hit a wall immediately. I can try moving left first.

If I move left, I can then move down towards the key. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Alternatively, moving right could allow me to access the rule blocks, which might be necessary to change the win condition or make the key accessible.

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving right to see if I can access the rule blocks. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules closer, I might be able to create a new rule that helps me win without needing the key.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by manipulating the rules. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the ball is a distraction, and I should focus on the key. If I can collect the key, perhaps that will trigger a win condition. But I need to get to the key first.

Let me try moving left to get closer to the key. If that's blocked by a wall, I'll have to find another path. But from the description, the walls are mostly on the right side, so moving left might be safer.

So, I think the best first move is to go left. That way, I can start moving towards the key and the ball, which might be essential for solving the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the right, which is close. There's a wall 5 steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules are spread out: ""is"" is 9 steps to the right, ""win"" is 10 steps to the right, and there are other rules like ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" placed at various positions.

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down, so I need to avoid that. The walls are in the way, but maybe I can move the rules to change the game's behavior.

The key is nearby, so maybe I should pick it up. But to get to the key, I need to move right once. Let me check if that's possible. Moving right from my current position would take me to the key. But I need to make sure there's no wall or stop in that path.

Wait, the wall is 5 steps to the right, so moving right once shouldn't hit a wall. The stop is 2 steps right and 1 down, so that's not directly in my path. So moving right should be safe.

After picking up the key, maybe I can use it to open a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps the key is needed to modify a rule. The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right, which is far. Maybe I can bring the ""win"" closer by moving the rule.

Alternatively, I could try to change the rules to make myself invincible or to change what counts as winning. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is.""

But first, I need to get closer to the rules. The ""is"" rule is 9 steps to the right, and ""win"" is next to it. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba,"" that would change the win condition.

However, moving rules requires me to be adjacent to them and then move them. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to get to the rules. The ""is"" rule is 9 steps to the right, which is quite far. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use the key to unlock something.

Wait, the ball is 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, the ""ball"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball affect the rules, I can change the game.

But perhaps the simplest thing is to move right to get the key. Let me try that. So, I'll move right once to pick up the key. That should give me the key, and then I can see what options I have next.

So, the action I'll take is to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. There's also a rule `key` at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Hmm, maybe I can use that to change the key's properties.

The walls are spread out, but I notice that the rule `stop` is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls passable. Also, there's a rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can manipulate these, I might be able to create a path.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. I wonder if the ball can be used to trigger something or if it's just an obstacle. There's also a rule `ball` at 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe I can change the ball's behavior.

I think the key is important here. If I can get the key, maybe it will unlock something. But to get the key, I need to move left and down. However, there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break a rule to make the walls stop being solid.

Wait, the rule `stop` is near me. If I can move that rule, I can make the walls stop being solid. Let me try moving the rule `stop` closer to the walls. If I can place it near the walls, maybe they'll become passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that might change the walls' properties. But I need to see where the ""is"" rule is. It's at 8 steps to the right. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it.

I'm also noticing that the rule `win` is 9 steps to the right. If I can reach that, maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the key, which is to the left and down. But walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move down first to get past some walls. Let me try moving down a few steps to see if I can find a path.

Wait, if I move down, I might hit a wall. But if I can manipulate the rules first, maybe I can make the walls passable. Let me try moving towards the rule `stop` to see if I can use it.

I think the best course of action is to move down to get closer to the rule `stop` and see if I can use it to make the walls passable. Once the walls are passable, I can move left to get the key and proceed towards the win condition.

So, I'll start by moving down to get closer to the rule `stop`.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step up. There are walls in various positions, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" The key is probably important because keys often unlock something.

I notice that the key is only one step up, so maybe I can move up to pick it up. But before I do that, I should check if there are any walls or stops in the way. The rule ""stop"" is one step to the right, so moving right might be blocked. But moving up, there's a wall four steps to the right and one step up. Wait, does that mean the wall is in the way if I move up? Or is it somewhere else?

I think the walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but since I'm Baba, I can push or move walls if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right, so maybe moving right is restricted. I should focus on moving up to get the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up, which seems far. But if I can manipulate the rules, perhaps I can make the win condition closer or change what counts as winning.

I also see a ball two steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something or change the rules when it moves. But right now, I think the key is the priority.

So, my plan is to move up to get the key. That should be the first step. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There are walls in various positions, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. That's pretty far. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the win condition closer or change it. The ""key"" is nearby, so perhaps I need to pick it up to unlock something. 

The ""ball"" is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break walls. Maybe I can use the ball to clear a path. 

The ""rule `is`"" is at 8 steps to the right, which might be a rule I can move to create new rules. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can redefine properties. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could change what ""win"" means.

I also see a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to make walls stop being solid, which would help me pass through them.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the key first. It's 1 step to the left, so I can move left. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" rule, I could create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition, but that might not be helpful. Or maybe ""win is key,"" making the key the win condition, which would be easier to reach.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule, I could make ""key is win,"" which would mean that when I pick up the key, I win. That sounds promising. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps right to next to the ""key"" rule, which is 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So I need to move the ""is"" rule down and left. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" The ""is"" rule is just a rule, so I can move it. I need to plan the path to get the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. But the ""key"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 steps down, and the ""is"" rule is 8 steps right. So if I move the ""key"" rule right by one, it would be next to ""is,"" making ""key is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Wait, if I move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" it would create a new rule like ""key is [something]."" If I can position it so that ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. 

So, to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule to the right by one step, so it's at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, next to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right. Then, the rule would be ""key is win."" 

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I can only move it if it's not ""stop."" Since it's a rule, I can move it. So I can move the ""key"" rule right by one step. 

Once that's done, the rule ""key is win"" would be active. Then, when I pick up the key, I would win. 

So, my plan is:

1. Move the ""key"" rule from 7 steps right and 3 steps down to 8 steps right and 3 steps down, next to the ""is"" rule.
2. This creates the rule ""key is win.""
3. Then, I can move to the key, which is 1 step to the left, pick it up, and win the level.

But wait, can I move the ""key"" rule directly? Or do I need to move the ""is"" rule instead? Maybe it's easier to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position. 

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is. Let me see: the ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right. The ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I move the ""is"" rule down by 3 steps, it would be at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Then, the ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I move the ""is"" rule left by one, it would be next to the ""key"" rule, making ""key is [something].""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should instead focus on moving the ""key"" rule next to ""is."" 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can't change that unless I move the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""you is win,"" which would mean that I, as Baba, am the win condition. But that might not be helpful unless I can reach the win object.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the key. The key is 1 step to the left. If I can get to it, maybe it unlocks a door or changes a rule. 

But to get to the key, I need to move left. Let me check if there's a wall blocking me. The walls are at 4 steps right, and some are down. So moving left from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point) should be possible.

Wait, where am I? The observation doesn't specify my position, but the key is 1 step to the left, so I must be near it. Let me try moving left to pick up the key.

But before I do that, I should check if there are any walls or stops in the way. The walls are at 4 steps right, so moving left from my position shouldn't hit any walls. 

So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a rule or change the win condition.

After picking up the key, I can look for a door or another rule that requires the key. Alternatively, I can use the key to break a wall or move a rule.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I have the key, perhaps I can use it in combination with the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win with the key.

I think the best approach is to first pick up the key by moving left. Then, I can see if I can use it to change the win condition or unlock a path.

So, my action is to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the right, walls, some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" The key is one step to the right, and there's a wall five steps to the right. There are also several rule blocks scattered around.

I think the first step is to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to see if I can move any rule blocks to change the game's rules.

I notice there's a ""key"" rule block six steps down and eight steps to the right. Maybe if I can move that, I can create a new rule that helps me. Also, there's a ""ball"" rule block eight steps to the right and six steps down. Perhaps combining these could do something.

Wait, the ""key"" is only one step to the right. Maybe I can pick it up and use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure how keys work in this context. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule.

I also see a ""stop"" rule block two steps to the right and one step down. If I can move that, I might be able to stop certain objects or myself, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Another thought: the ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right. If I can change the win condition, maybe I can make it easier to win. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach the win object.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" So I need to check if the rule blocks are movable. Since they're text blocks, I think they can be moved unless they're defined as ""stop.""

Looking back, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one step down. So if I move that, maybe I can prevent something from moving. But I'm not sure if that's useful right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving a ""is"" block next to another object. For example, if I can move ""key is you,"" then the key would become me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the key is one step to the right. If I move right, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can use it to change a rule. But I'm not sure how keys function in this game. Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or change a rule.

I also see a ""ball"" three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used in some way, like pushing it to break a wall or change a rule.

Another idea: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can reach it more easily. The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right, which is quite far. If I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition, that might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to Baba. That way, wherever I go, I can win immediately.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. The ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right. If I can move that closer, I can form the new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is also present in multiple places. Maybe I can use one of the closer ""is"" blocks to create a new rule.

Looking at the objects again, I see a ""rule `is`"" three steps down. If I can move that next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is [something]."" But I need to figure out what that something is.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" or ""baba is ball"" to gain new abilities. For example, if I'm a ball, I might be able to push things or move differently.

But I'm not sure how to move the rule blocks. I think I can only move them if they're not defined as ""stop."" Since the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one step down, I might need to move that first to allow other blocks to be moved.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can prevent myself from stopping, allowing me to move through walls or other objects. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Another approach: maybe I can create a loop or a new rule that allows me to move more freely. For example, if I can make ""baba is push,"" I can push objects around more easily.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule in the current setup. So that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""key"" to unlock a path. The key is one step to the right, so I can move right to pick it up. Then, perhaps I can use it to change a rule that involves the key.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move that closer, I can create a new rule involving the key.

But I'm not sure how to move the rule blocks. I think I can only move them if they're not defined as ""stop."" So I need to check if the ""key"" rule is movable.

Since the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one step down, I might need to move that first to allow other blocks to be moved.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" to create ""key is [something]."" But I'm not sure what that would achieve.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key would become the win condition. Then, I just need to pick up the key to win. That could be a way to simplify the puzzle.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to the key. The ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, which is quite far. Maybe I can find a closer ""is"" block.

Looking back, there's a ""rule `is`"" three steps down. If I can move that next to the key, I can create ""key is [something]."" But I need to figure out what that something is.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" which would make the key controllable. But I'm not sure if that's useful.

Wait, I'm already Baba, and the key is a separate object. If I can make the key part of me, maybe I can use it to change rules.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" block next to the key and then next to ""you"" to create ""key is you.""

But that would require moving multiple blocks, and I'm not sure if that's possible.

Another thought: the ""ball"" is three steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use it to move other objects.

But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so the ball becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the ball.

But the ball is three steps down, which might be easier than reaching the win rule ten steps to the right.

So, perhaps I can create ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to the ball.

But the ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, which is far. Maybe I can find a closer ""is"" block.

Looking back, there's a ""rule `is`"" three steps down. If I can move that next to the ball, I can create ""ball is [something]."" Then, I can move the ""win"" rule next to that to make ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" rule. It's ten steps to the right, which is quite far.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move more freely, like ""baba is fly"" or ""baba is pass."" But I don't see those rules available.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent myself from stopping, allowing me to move through walls.

But I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe if I make ""baba is stop,"" I can stop myself, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop rule would be removed, allowing me to move through walls.

But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another idea: maybe I can use the ""key"" to change the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to the key. The ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, which is far. Maybe I can find a closer ""is"" block.

But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another thought: maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" which would allow me to use the key's properties. But I'm not sure what the key's properties are.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" which would make the key controllable. Then, I can move the key to change rules.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I think I need to move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules next to the key.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and six steps down. If I can move that closer, I can create ""key is you.""

But that's quite far. Maybe I can find a closer ""you"" rule.

Looking back, I don't see another ""you"" rule. So that might not be possible.

Another idea: maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to Baba. That way, wherever I go, I can win immediately.

But the ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, which is far. Maybe I can find a closer ""is"" block.

Looking back, there's a ""rule `is`"" three steps down. If I can move that next to Baba, I can create ""baba is [something]."" Then, I can move the ""win"" rule next to that to make ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" rule. It's ten steps to the right, which is quite far.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move more freely, like ""baba is fly."" But I don't see a ""fly"" rule.

Wait, the ""ball"" is three steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to help me move. If I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I can gain the ball's properties, which might allow me to move differently.

But I'm not sure what the ball's properties are. Maybe it can push things or move through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so the ball becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the ball.

But the ball is three steps down, which might be easier than reaching the win rule ten steps to the right.

So, perhaps I can create ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to the ball.

But the ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, which is far. Maybe I can find a closer ""is"" block.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not be possible.

But I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe if I make ""baba is stop,"" I can stop myself, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop rule would be removed, allowing me to move through walls.

But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the right, walls spread out, and some rules scattered around. The key is one step to the right, which is close. There's also a ball three steps down, which might be useful later. The rules include ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right. That's pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to change the win condition. The ""key"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move the key next to the ""is"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. That would make things easier since the key is closer.

To do that, I need to move the key to a position where it can be combined with an ""is"" rule. The key is currently one step to the right. If I move right, I can pick it up. But wait, I'm Baba, so I can move through objects unless they're defined as ""stop."" I don't see any ""stop"" rules affecting me right now, so I can move freely.

Let me plan the steps. First, I need to move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can move it next to an ""is"" rule. Looking at the ""is"" rules, there's one 9 steps to the right, which is too far, but there's another ""is"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. That's closer. If I can move the key to that position, I can create ""key is win.""

So, the first step is to move right to get the key. Then, I can move down to reach the ""is"" rule. But I need to make sure there's a clear path. Let me check the walls. There are walls 5 steps to the right and at various down positions, but I can navigate around them if needed.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. That might block my path. I need to avoid that. Maybe I can move down first to bypass the stop rule. Let me see: if I move down, I can go below the stop rule and then move right. That way, I can reach the key without being stopped.

So, the plan is: move down to avoid the stop rule, then move right to get the key, and then move down again to place the key next to the ""is"" rule. Once the key is next to ""is,"" the rule becomes ""key is win,"" making the key the new win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key to win.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Move down to avoid the stop rule.
2. Move right to pick up the key.
3. Move down again to place the key next to the ""is"" rule.
4. Now, the rule ""key is win"" is active, so reaching the key will win the level.

I think this should work. Let me try moving down first to avoid any obstacles.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the right and up, a wall to the right and up, and some rules scattered around. The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and 1 step up, which seems pretty far. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right, which might block movement if I'm not careful.

I notice there's a ball two steps down. Maybe I can use that somehow. The ""key"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so it's diagonally up-right from me. The walls are positioned in a way that might create a barrier, but I can move around them if I can manipulate the rules.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" I can move these rule blocks to create new rules or change existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I might make ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. That could help me unlock something or move past a barrier.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is you,"" I could control the ball and maybe use it to break through walls or reach higher places. But I need to see if the ball is movable. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can only move Baba unless I change the rules.

I should also consider the ""stop"" rule. If I move into a position where ""stop"" is adjacent, it might prevent me from moving further, so I need to avoid that or find a way to remove it.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the key or the ball to see if I can create a new rule. Since the key is closer, maybe I'll go for that. I can move right and up to get to the key. Once I'm there, I can try to form ""key is you"" by moving the ""key"" rule next to ""is.""

But wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right. If I move right, I might trigger the ""stop"" rule and get stuck. Maybe I should move up first to avoid it. Let me check the map again.

If I move up, I can go towards the key without immediately hitting the ""stop."" Once I'm up, I can then move right to reach the key. Alternatively, moving left might give me space to maneuver without triggering ""stop.""

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I might change the win condition. For example, making ""win is you"" would mean I just need to be near the win block, but I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key to try and make ""key is you."" That way, I can pick up the key and possibly unlock a path to the win condition. Let me try moving right first to get closer to the key without triggering ""stop.""

Wait, moving right might bring me closer to ""stop."" Maybe I should move up first to avoid that. Let me try moving up to create some space. Once I'm up, I can move right towards the key.

Alternatively, if I move left, I can get away from the ""stop"" rule and then move up and right. That might be a safer path. Let me try moving left first.

After moving left, I can then move up and right towards the key. Once I'm near the key, I can try to form the ""key is you"" rule. That should allow me to control the key and proceed further.

I need to be careful not to get stuck by the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else or break it by moving its components apart. But that might be complicated. For now, I'll focus on getting the key.

So, my plan is: move left to avoid ""stop,"" then move up and right to reach the key, and then create ""key is you."" Once I have the key, I can see if it unlocks a path to the win condition or helps in manipulating other rules.

Let me start by moving left to create space and avoid the ""stop"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the right and one step up. There are walls at various positions, which probably block movement. There are also several rule blocks, like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and one step up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule to make the win condition something closer or easier to reach. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer to me.

I also see a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make some walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure yet.

The ball is two steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball into something useful, like a key or a win condition. But I'm not sure how.

I think the key is to rearrange the rules to make the win condition something I can reach. Maybe I can make ""ball is win"" or something like that. But first, I need to get to the rule blocks to move them.

Right now, I'm at the starting position. The key is one step right and up. Maybe I should move towards the key first. If I can pick up the key, maybe it can help me unlock something or change a rule.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that aren't stopped. So I need to make sure I can move the key. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, which is me. So I can move towards the key.

Let me plan my steps. I need to move right once and up once to get to the key. But I have to check if there are any walls blocking me. The walls are at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is beyond the key's position. So I should be able to move right and up without hitting a wall.

Once I get the key, maybe I can use it to open a door or change a rule. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is something."" Maybe ""key is win"" so that picking up the key wins the level.

But first, I need to get to the key. So my first move should be to the right to get closer. Then up to reach the key.

Wait, but the key is one step to the right and one step up. So from my current position, moving right once and then up once should get me there. But I have to make sure there are no walls in between.

Looking at the walls, the closest one is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is far from my current position. So moving right and up should be safe.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first and then right, but that might not be necessary. Let me try moving right first.

So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step up, which might be important. There are walls placed at various positions, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's pretty far. The ""key"" is closer, just one step up. Maybe I need the key to unlock something or change a rule. 

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. If I move right, I might hit a stop, which could prevent me from moving further. I should be careful about that. 

The ""ball"" is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change rules when they collide. Maybe I can use the ball somehow.

The ""rule `is`"" is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's a long way. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block. 

I think the key is the first thing I should get. If I move up, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to break a wall or change a rule. 

But wait, moving up might take me closer to the ""stop"" rule. If I step on ""stop,"" I can't move anymore. I need to make sure I don't get stuck. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get closer to the ""is"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" block, I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something else to make the key the win condition. That would make it easier to win by just picking up the key.

Let me plan this out. If I move right, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""key"" block to make ""key is win."" Once that's done, picking up the key would make me win. 

But I have to be careful not to trigger the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" is 1 step to the right, so if I move right once, I might hit it. Maybe I can move up first to avoid it. 

Wait, the ""stop"" is 1 step to the right, so if I'm currently at position (0,0), moving right would take me to (1,0), which is the ""stop."" That's bad. I don't want to stop moving. 

So maybe I should move up first to (0,1), where the key is. Then, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can move right without worrying about stopping because I have the key. 

But I'm not sure if having the key changes anything about the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I should try moving up to get the key first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to get away from the ""stop"" rule. But the key is to the right, so moving left doesn't help. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The key is one step up, and the ""stop"" is one step to the right. If I move up, I can get the key without hitting the stop. Then, with the key, maybe I can break a wall or change a rule. 

Once I have the key, I can look for a wall that's in my way. There are walls at 4 steps to the right and various down positions. Maybe I can use the key to break a wall, allowing me to reach the ""win"" rule. 

But I'm not sure how the key works in this context. In Baba Is You, keys usually open locks, but here, maybe the key can be used to change rules. 

Wait, if I have the key, I can move it next to a rule block to create a new rule. For example, moving the key next to ""is"" would make ""key is [something]."" If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. 

So, the plan is: move up to get the key, then move the key next to the ""is"" rule to create ""key is win."" Then, picking up the key would win the level. 

But I need to make sure I can move the key without getting stuck. Let me see the positions. The key is at (1,1). The ""is"" rule is at (8,1). That's a long way. Maybe I can move the key down to (1,2) and then move it right towards the ""is"" rule. 

But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various down positions. So, moving the key right might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the key's position. But the ""is"" rule is far away. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make myself into a different object. If I can change ""baba is you"" to something else, I might gain new abilities. 

But I don't see any other ""is"" rules nearby. The closest ""is"" is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's too far. 

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I can move the ball to hit a wall or a rule block, it might create a new rule or break a wall. 

But I'm not sure how to control the ball. In Baba Is You, balls move based on physics, so if I push them, they roll until they hit something. Maybe I can push the ball to hit the ""is"" rule. 

But the ball is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. I'm at (0,0). To get to the ball, I need to move left and down, but moving left might take me out of the map or into walls. 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving right to see what happens. If I move right once, I hit the ""stop"" rule and can't move anymore. That's bad. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get the key first. Let's try that. 

So, I'll move up to (0,1) to pick up the key. Now I have the key. Next, I need to move the key next to the ""is"" rule to make ""key is win."" 

But the ""is"" rule is at (8,1). That's 8 steps to the right. I need to move the key right 8 times, but there are walls in the way. 

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the right and various down positions. So, maybe I can move the key down to avoid the walls. 

Let me try moving down once from (0,1) to (0,2). Now, I'm at (0,2) with the key. From here, I can move right towards the ""is"" rule. 

But the walls are at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is (4,2). So, moving right 4 steps would take me to (4,2), which is a wall. I can't go through walls. 

Hmm, maybe I can move the key further down. Let's go down to (0,3). Now, I'm at (0,3) with the key. Moving right, I can go to (1,3), (2,3), etc., but I need to check if there are walls. 

Looking back, the walls are at 4 steps to the right and various down positions. So, at (4,3), there's a wall. I can't go beyond that. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to find another way to create a new rule. 

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at (1,2). If I can push the ball to hit the ""is"" rule, maybe it will create a new rule. 

But I'm at (0,3) with the key. To get to the ball, I need to move left to (-1,3), which is out of bounds. That's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key to the ball's position. But that would require moving left, which I can't do from (0,3). 

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the rules again. 

The active rule is ""baba is you."" If I can change this rule, I might gain new abilities. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. 

But to change the rule, I need to move the ""is"" block. The ""is"" rule is at (8,1). That's too far. 

Wait, there's another ""is"" rule at (8,1). Maybe I can move that one. But it's too far away. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""key"" next to ""is."" If I can get the key to (8,1), then ""key is [something]"" would be created. 

But again, the distance is too great with walls in the way. 

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move right and see what happens. If I move right once, I hit the ""stop"" rule and can't move anymore. That's bad. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first to avoid the ""stop"" rule. Let's try moving down to (0,1). Wait, the key is at (1,1). So, moving right from (0,1) would take me to (1,1), where the key is. 

Wait, I'm getting confused with the coordinates. Let me clarify. 

If I'm at (0,0), moving up takes me to (0,1), where the key is. Moving right from (0,0) takes me to (1,0), which is the ""stop"" rule. 

So, moving up is safer. Let's do that. I move up to (0,1) and pick up the key. Now, I have the key. 

Next, I need to create a new rule. Maybe I can move the key next to the ""is"" rule. But the ""is"" rule is at (8,1). That's 8 steps to the right. 

I can try moving right 8 times, but I have to avoid walls. Let's see: 

From (0,1), moving right to (1,1) is the key's original position. Then, (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), etc. 

But at (4,1), there's a wall. So, I can't go beyond (4,1). 

Hmm, maybe I can move down to (0,2) and then move right. Let's try that. 

From (0,1), move down to (0,2). Now, I'm at (0,2) with the key. Moving right, I can go to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), but (4,2) is a wall. 

So, I can't go beyond (4,2). 

This isn't working. Maybe I need to use the ball somehow. The ball is at (1,2). If I can push it, it might hit a rule block. 

But I'm at (0,2) with the key. To get to the ball, I need to move right to (1,2). Then, I can push the ball further right. 

Let me try that. Move right to (1,2), pick up the ball. Now, I have the ball. 

If I push the ball right, it will roll until it hits something. Let's see: from (1,2), moving right, the ball would go to (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), which is a wall. So, the ball would stop at (4,2). 

But that doesn't help me. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball down. From (1,2), moving down to (1,3), (1,4), etc. But I don't see any rule blocks down there. 

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at (9,1). If I can make ""baba is win,"" I would win immediately. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba."" 

But the ""is"" rule is at (8,1). So, if I can move the ""is"" rule to (7,1), then ""baba is win"" would be created. 

But how can I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be able to push it, but it's too far away. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""key"" next to ""is."" If I can get the key to (8,1), then ""key is win"" would be created. 

But again, the distance is too great with walls in the way. 

Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,0). If I can move it somewhere else, I can avoid getting stuck. 

But I don't have a way to move the ""stop"" rule right now. 

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule up, it would be at (1,1), where the key is. But I can't move the ""stop"" rule because it's a rule block, and I don't have a way to interact with it. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another approach. 

Let me think about the ""ball"" again. If I can use the ball to break a wall, I might be able to create a path. 

But the walls are made of ""wall"" rules, which are immovable unless I change their properties. 

Wait, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls. But I don't have a ""push"" rule here. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. 

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the key to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at (9,1). If I can get the key there, maybe it will trigger a win. 

But again, the distance is too far with walls blocking the way. 

Wait, maybe I can use the ball to push the key. If I have the ball and the key, I can push the key towards the ""is"" rule. 

But I'm not sure how to coordinate that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key down to (0,2) and then move right, but the walls are in the way. 

I'm not making progress here. Maybe I need to try a different strategy. 

Let me try moving right once to see what happens. If I move right from (0,0), I go to (1,0), which is the ""stop"" rule. Now, I can't move anymore. That's bad. 

So, I shouldn't move right first. 

Let me try moving up to get the key first. From (0,0), move up to (0,1) and pick up the key. Now, I have the key. 

Next, I need to create a new rule. Maybe I can move the key next to the ""is"" rule. But it's too far. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key to a position where it can be used to break a wall. 

Wait, if I can make ""key is break,"" then I can break walls. But I don't have a ""break"" rule here. 

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I need to think about the ""ball"" differently. If I can push the ball to hit a rule block, it might create a new rule. 

But I'm not sure how to do that. 

Wait, the ball is at (1,2). If I can push it to (1,3), and there's a rule block there, it might create a new rule. 

But I don't see any rule blocks at (1,3). 

This is really frustrating. I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to try a different approach. 

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (1,5). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba,"" I can change the rule. 

But the ""is"" rule is at (8,1). That's too far. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the ""is"" rule. But I can't move rule blocks. 

I'm stuck. I think I need to try moving the key to the ""is"" rule somehow, even if it takes multiple steps. 

Let me try moving the key right as far as I can. From (0,1), move right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), which is a wall. So, I can't go further. 

Hmm, maybe I can move the key down to (0,2) and then right. From (0,2), move right to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), which is a wall. 

Still stuck. 

Wait, maybe I can move the key further down to (0,3) and then right. From (0,3), move right to (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), which is a wall. 

No luck. 

I'm not sure what else to do. Maybe I should try moving the ball to see if it can help. 

From (0,2), move right to (1,2) to pick up the ball. Now, I have the ball. 

If I push the ball right, it goes to (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), which is a wall. 

If I push the ball down, it goes to (1,3), (1,4), etc., but I don't see any rule blocks there. 

This isn't helping. 

Maybe I need to think about the ""win"" rule. It's at (9,1). If I can reach it, I win. But the walls are blocking the way. 

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step up, a wall four steps to the right and one step up, and some rules like ""is"" and ""win"" placed further to the right. There's also a ball and other walls and rules scattered around.

Hmm, the key is just one step up from my current position. Maybe I can move up to pick it up. But wait, I need to see if there are any walls or stops in the way. The wall is four steps to the right and one step up, so it's not directly blocking my path to the key. So moving up should be possible.

But before I move, I should consider the rules. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right, which might mean that moving right from there would stop me. But since I'm moving up, maybe that's not an issue right now.

Also, there's a ""ball"" one step to the left and two steps down. I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The ""key"" is at 1 step up, so maybe I can move up to get it. Once I have the key, perhaps I can unlock something else or change a rule.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's pretty far. Maybe I need to create a new rule or modify an existing one to make reaching ""win"" easier. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" and ""win"" rules closer. Let me see where the ""key"" rule is. It's seven steps to the right and two steps down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's a bit spread out. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer to the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up, which is near the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I could create ""key is win.""

But how do I move the rules? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. So I need to check if the ""key"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, I think I can move it by pushing or pulling.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me plan my steps. First, move up to get the key. Then, maybe move right to get closer to the rules. But I need to be careful not to hit any walls or stops.

Alternatively, maybe I should first move right to get near the ""is"" rule and then combine it with ""key"" to make ""key is win."" That way, when I pick up the key, I win.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""key"" rule directly. Maybe I need to break apart the existing rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key,"" I can create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right and two steps down. So they're not too far apart. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is, then combine them.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""key"" rule. Let me try moving right a few times to get near the ""is"" rule.

Wait, I'm currently at the starting position. The key is one step up, so moving up would get me the key. But I need to see if that's the best move. If I get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something else.

Alternatively, maybe I should first move right to get near the ""is"" rule and then create a new rule. Let me think about the possible actions.

I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Moving up gets me the key. Moving right takes me towards the walls and rules. Maybe moving right is better to set up a new rule.

But I'm not sure. Let me try moving up to get the key first. That might give me more options later.

Wait, but if I move up, I might be blocked by a wall. Let me check the walls. The wall is four steps to the right and one step up. So if I'm moving up from my current position, I'm not directly under the wall. So moving up should be possible.

Okay, I'll move up to get the key. Then, I can see if I can use it to change the rules or reach the win condition.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. That's pretty far. To get there, I might need to manipulate some rules. The key is nearby, so maybe it's needed to unlock something. There's also a ball, which might be used to push objects or break walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make a path. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can change that, I could remove walls or make them passable.

I think the key is to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or make the walls stop being walls. Maybe if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" or ""wall,"" I can redefine them.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the key. It's one step to the right, so I'll go right. Then, I can use the key to open a path or maybe combine it with another rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" or something else that changes the wall's behavior. If I can make walls stop being solid, I can pass through them.

I should also consider the ball. If I can make the ball push walls or other objects, that might help clear a path. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and maybe use it to unlock the win condition. But I need to see if that's possible by moving the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. Alternatively, I can try to bring the ""is"" rule closer to the ""key"" rule to create a new rule.

I think the best first step is to move right to get closer to the key and the other rules. That way, I can start manipulating the rules to my advantage.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the left. There's also a wall three steps to the right, and some rules like ""is"" and ""win"" further to the right. There's a ""stop"" rule one step down, which probably means that if I move down, I might hit a stop block. 

I see a ""wall"" rule two steps to the left and two steps down. That might be a way to create or modify walls. There's a ball two steps to the left and three steps down, which could be useful if I can make it do something. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and three steps down, which might be a key to unlock something.

The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and six steps down, and the ""you"" rule is six steps down. The ""ball"" rule is six steps to the right and six steps down. 

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change how objects behave. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up or move text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to something else, I might be able to make the key do something different.

But first, I need to get closer to the key. It's one step to the left, so maybe I should move left. But wait, if I move left, I might be able to pick up the key or move it. Alternatively, moving down could help me reach other rules, but there's a ""stop"" rule down, which might block me.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. If I move left, I can get to the key. If I move right, I might hit walls or other rules. Moving down might lead me to more rules, but the ""stop"" could be a barrier.

I think the best first step is to move left to get to the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something or change a rule. Alternatively, moving down could allow me to access the ""wall"" rule and modify walls to create a path.

Wait, but if I move down, I might hit the ""stop"" rule, which could prevent me from moving further. Maybe I should first move left to get the key, then see what options I have.

So, I'll choose to move left to get closer to the key. That might give me more options to manipulate rules or objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There's also a ""rule `win`"" 9 steps to the right, so that's probably where I need to go. But there are walls in the way, so I need to figure out how to get past them.

I notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid. Also, there's a ""rule `wall`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can change the properties of the walls.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to break through walls or something. There's also a ""rule `key`"" 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something.

I think the key is close to me, so I should move towards it. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to interact with the ""rule `stop`"" or ""rule `wall`"" to change the rules.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. The walls are 4 steps to the right, and there are multiple walls blocking the path. The ""rule `win`"" is far to the right, so I need to find a way to get past those walls.

If I move left, I can get the key, but I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the rules first. For example, if I can move the ""rule `stop`"" or ""rule `wall`"" to change how walls behave, I might be able to pass through them.

Another idea: if I can make Baba into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to roll through walls. There's a ""rule `ball`"" 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can create a new rule that makes Baba a ball, I can move more freely.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Each move could potentially allow me to pick up a rule or an object.

Since the key is close, moving left to get it might be a good first step. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to break a wall or change a rule. Alternatively, if I move right, I might be able to reach the ""rule `is`"" or ""rule `win`"" sooner.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 8 steps to the right. If I can move that rule, I might be able to create a new rule that helps me. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS BALL,"" I could become a ball and roll through walls.

But moving 8 steps to the right seems too far with walls in the way. Maybe I need to find a different approach. Let me check the other rules. There's a ""rule `you`"" 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can change what ""you"" is.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should start by moving towards the key since it's nearby. Once I have the key, I can see if it helps in manipulating the rules or opening a path.

So, I think the best first move is to go left to pick up the key. That might give me an advantage in solving the puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key one step to the right. There's also a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules section shows that there's a ""win"" rule ten steps to the right, so that's probably the target I need to reach.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down. That might mean that if I move in that direction, I could get stopped, so I should avoid that area unless necessary.

There's a ball three steps down, and a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and six steps down. That might be useful for changing my properties or the win condition.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change what I can do or what counts as winning. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up or move text blocks to create new rules.

First, I should probably move towards the key. It's only one step to the right, so I can go there. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to break through a wall or change a rule.

But wait, there's a wall five steps to the right. If I move right five times, I'll hit the wall. Maybe I can go around it by moving down or up. Let me check the layout again.

The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right, which is far. To get there, I might need to go around the wall. Maybe I can move down a bit to avoid the wall and then go right.

Alternatively, if I can change the ""win"" rule to something else, I might not need to go all the way to the right. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""ball"" rule eight steps to the right and six steps down. If I can move that closer or combine it with ""is win,"" that could work.

But first, I need to get the key. Let me plan my moves. I'll start by moving right to get the key. Then, I can see if I can manipulate any rules to make progress.

Wait, but if I move right, I might hit the wall. Let me check the exact positions. The wall is five steps to the right, so if I move right five times, I'll be blocked. Maybe I can move down first to go under the wall.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball three steps down. If I move down three times, I can reach the ball. But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, I can move right once to get the key, then maybe move down to avoid the wall. Let me try that.

So, first action: right to get the key. Then, I can assess the situation better.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the right. That might be useful later, maybe to unlock something. There's also a wall four steps to the right, which could be an obstacle. The rules section shows several ""is"" blocks, which are probably used to create new rules by moving them around.

I notice there's a ""win"" rule nine steps to the right. If I can get to that, maybe I can change the win condition. But first, I need to figure out how to move through the map. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and one step down, which might mean that moving in that direction could stop me, so I should avoid that.

There's a ""wall"" rule one step to the left and two steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can create a path or block something. The ball is one step to the left and three steps down. Balls in Baba Is You usually push things, so maybe I can use that to my advantage.

The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right and three steps down. That's quite far, but maybe I can get there after dealing with other rules. The ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and six steps down, which might be a way to duplicate or change my own properties.

I think the best approach is to move right to get closer to the key and the win rule. Since I'm currently at the starting point, moving right will help me progress towards the goal. I should check if there are any immediate obstacles. The wall four steps to the right might block my path, but if I can manipulate the rules before reaching it, I might be able to pass through.

Alternatively, moving down could allow me to access other rules or objects, but I don't want to trigger the ""stop"" rule. Maybe moving up isn't necessary right now. Let me focus on moving right to get closer to the key and the win rule. That seems like the most straightforward path forward.

So, I'll choose to move right to start progressing towards the key and the win condition. Hopefully, that will set me up for the next steps in solving the puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the left. There's also a wall three steps to the right. The rules section shows several rule blocks: ""is"" at seven steps right, ""win"" at eight steps right, ""stop"" one step down, and ""wall"" two steps left and two steps down. There's also a ball two steps left and three steps down, and other walls and rule blocks further down.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can also pick up and move rule blocks to change the rules. The key is nearby, so maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But first, I should check if there are any immediate obstacles.

The wall is three steps to the right, which might block my path. If I can move the wall or change its properties, that could help. The ""stop"" rule is one step down, which probably makes the wall immovable. If I can change that, maybe I can move the wall.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps left and two steps down. If I can move that rule block, I could redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I could push the walls. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is stop,"" that might prevent me from moving through them, but I'm not sure.

The key is one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned here. Alternatively, the key might be used to change a rule involving the win condition.

The ball is two steps left and three steps down. Balls in Baba Is You often have specific properties, like being pushable or explosive. If I can manipulate the ball's rules, maybe I can use it to reach the win.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can change that rule, I might redefine what constitutes winning. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I need to see if that's possible.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. First, I should probably move towards the key to pick it up. Since the key is one step to the left, I can move left to get it. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to interact with other objects or rules.

But before I move, I should check if there are any immediate threats or necessary rule changes. The ""stop"" rule is one step down, which might be affecting the wall's movement. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I could make the wall movable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule to change the wall's properties. If I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the wall out of the way. That would allow me to move past it and reach the win condition.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right. If I can move that, I can create new rules. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win"" or something similar.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule directly. I might need to first pick up the key to unlock the ability to move certain rule blocks.

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to interact with the ""stop"" rule or the ""wall"" rule.
3. Change the wall's properties to make it movable.
4. Push the wall out of the way to reach the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can redefine the win condition, that might be a quicker path. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I win immediately. But I need to see if that's possible with the current setup.

Another thought: the ball is two steps left and three steps down. If I can manipulate the ball's rules, maybe I can use it to reach the win. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, and I can move towards it.

But I'm not sure if that's the intended path. Let me focus on the key first. Picking up the key might unlock other possibilities.

So, my first move should be to move left to pick up the key. That way, I can use it to interact with other rule blocks and change the rules to my advantage.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving away from the win condition. I need to make sure that moving left is the right choice. Alternatively, maybe I should move right towards the wall and see if I can manipulate it without the key.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. The key is one step to the left, the wall is three steps to the right, and the win rule is eight steps to the right. There are also several rule blocks and walls in different positions.

If I move right, I might hit the wall, which is three steps to the right. If the wall is immovable, I can't proceed further. So, I need to find a way to move the wall or change its properties.

Alternatively, if I can redefine the wall's properties, I might be able to walk through it or push it. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the wall to the side.

But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule block. The ""wall"" rule is two steps left and two steps down. If I can move that, I can redefine the wall's properties.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move objects that are not defined as ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is one step down, which might be making the wall immovable. If I can change the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to move the wall.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win,"" which would win the game.

But I'm not sure if that's possible without moving other rule blocks first. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock the ability to move certain rule blocks.

In any case, my first move should be to pick up the key, as it's nearby and might be essential for solving the puzzle. So, I'll move left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right, which might be useful for unlocking something. There are walls placed at various positions, which could block my path or be moved if I can change the rules.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" I need to see how these can be manipulated. The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right, so that's probably the target I need to reach or modify.

I notice that there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what stops movement. Also, the ""wall"" rule is two steps down, which might allow me to redefine walls if I move it.

The ball is three steps down, and there's a ""ball"" rule eight steps to the right and three down. Maybe I can make the ball do something else by moving its rule.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to redefine what ""win"" means. Since I can move text blocks, I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create new rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" could change the win condition.

Alternatively, moving the ""stop"" rule could make walls not stop me anymore. If I can make walls not stop, I can pass through them. Let me see how to do that.

I need to move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it's next to ""wall,"" so the rule becomes ""wall is stop."" But wait, the current rule is ""wall is stop,"" which is why walls block me. If I can change that, maybe I can make walls not stop.

Wait, no, the current rule is ""wall is stop,"" so walls stop movement. If I move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe walls won't stop anymore. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is you,"" making walls passable.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one down. If I move it, I can change what stops movement. Maybe I can make the key stop instead, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition, so I win immediately. But I don't know if that's possible.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and six down. If I can move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""you,"" I can make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. Maybe I need to create a new rule like ""baba is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is at nine steps to the right and one up. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down. The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and one up.

Hmm, this might be complicated. Maybe a better approach is to move the ""stop"" rule so that it's not associated with walls anymore. If I can make walls not stop, I can walk through them.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pick up the key and unlock something. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I can move it next to ""is"" to make ""key is something.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and three down. If I move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""key is something."" Maybe ""key is win,"" so the key becomes the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to plan the steps. I need to move the ""is"" rule to a position where it can form a new rule with another object.

First, I need to move towards the ""is"" rule. It's nine steps to the right and one up. But I'm currently at the starting position. So I need to move right nine times and up once. But there are walls in the way.

Wait, the walls are at five steps to the right and various down positions. So maybe I can go around them. Let me see the layout.

The walls are at 5 steps right, 1 up; 5 right, 1 down; 5 right, 2 down; etc. So the path to the ""is"" rule is blocked by walls. I can't reach it directly.

Maybe I need to change the rules first. If I can make walls passable, I can reach the ""is"" rule. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how? The ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe walls won't stop me. Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to redefine walls.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps down. If I move it next to ""is,"" I can make ""wall is something else."" For example, ""wall is you,"" which would make walls passable.

So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule to a position where it's next to ""is."" The ""wall"" rule is two steps down. The ""is"" rule is nine right and one up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule instead.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position. If I move the ""stop"" rule next to something else, like the ball, I can make ""ball is stop,"" which might not help.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it's not associated with walls. If I can do that, walls won't stop me anymore.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. It's two steps right and one down. I can move it to a different location, but I need to plan the path.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, ""wall is you,"" so walls become passable.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's nine steps to the right and one up. I can't reach it because of the walls. So I need another approach.

Maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can make ""baba is something.""

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is six steps down. The ""is"" rule is nine right and one up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule instead.

The ""you"" rule is two steps right and six down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can make ""you is something.""

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is eight steps right and six down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can make ""ball is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule first. Let me see.

The ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can change what stops movement.

But I'm not sure how to move it. I need to move the ""stop"" rule by moving the text block. So I need to be next to it and move it.

But to get to the ""stop"" rule, I need to move two steps right and one down. Let me see if that's possible.

From my starting position, I can move right two steps and down one. Are there walls blocking that path? The walls are at five steps right and various down positions. So two right and one down should be clear.

Yes, I can move there. So I can move right twice and down once to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it somewhere else.

If I move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, what happens? The current rule is ""wall is stop,"" which makes walls block movement. If I move the ""stop"" rule away, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, so walls no longer stop me.

So, by moving the ""stop"" rule, I can make walls passable. That would allow me to reach the ""is"" rule and other areas.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right twice and down once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. With walls now passable, move to the ""is"" rule and create a new rule, such as ""baba is win,"" to win the level.

Let me try to execute this step by step.

First, I need to move right twice and down once. So, the actions would be:

right, right, down.

After that, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it somewhere else. Let's say I move it to the left, so the rule becomes ""stop is something else,"" but I need to make sure it's not associated with walls anymore.

Alternatively, I can move it to a position where it's not part of any rule, effectively removing it from the ruleset.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, walls won't stop me, and I can proceed to the ""is"" rule.

Then, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can reach the ""is"" rule after making walls passable.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and one up. That's far, but if walls are passable, I can reach it.

So, after moving the ""stop"" rule, I can go through the walls, move right to the ""is"" rule, and then create the new rule.

This seems like a viable strategy. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move right twice and down once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a new location, breaking ""wall is stop.""
3. Move through the walls to reach the ""is"" rule.
4. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
5. With ""baba is win,"" I win the level.

I think this should work. Now, I'll try to perform the first step: moving right twice and down once.

After getting the key, I can use it to open locks or change rules. But I don't see any locks mentioned, so maybe the key is for rearranging rules. The ""key"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can move the key rule closer to make it easier to use.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's directly to my left. There's a wall three steps to the right, which might block my path. The rule ""is"" is seven steps to the right, and ""win"" is eight steps to the right. That suggests that the win condition is far to the right, beyond the wall.

I also notice a ""stop"" rule one step down. That probably means if I step down, I'll stop moving, which could be useful or a hindrance. There's a ""wall"" rule two steps to the left and two steps down, which might mean that if I move in that area, walls could be created or modified.

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but it might be part of the puzzle. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and three steps down, which could mean that picking up the key might unlock something.

The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and six steps down, and ""you"" is six steps down. This might mean that if I move down six steps, I can change who I am or what I can do.

So, my initial thought is to move left to pick up the key. That might be necessary to unlock the win condition. But before I do that, I should check if moving left is possible without hitting any walls or getting stopped.

I'm currently at the starting position. If I move left, I can get the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open a path or change a rule. Alternatively, moving right might lead me towards the win condition, but the wall is in the way. Maybe I can break the wall or change its properties.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move down, I might get stuck. So, I should avoid moving down unless it's necessary. Maybe I can move up instead, but I don't see any objects above me.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but if I can change that, maybe I can walk through them.

But first, I need to get the key. So, moving left seems like the first step. Let me try that.

The walls are spread out, but I notice there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That might be important because if I can manipulate that, I could change how movement works.

I see a ""ball"" 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You usually can push things, so maybe I can use that. There's also a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something or change a rule.

The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, so that's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there. The walls are in the way, but if I can move them or change their properties, that might help.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make walls stop me or not. Or perhaps I can change the ""baba is you"" rule to something else to gain new abilities.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" nearby. If I can make the ball push the walls, that might clear a path. Or maybe I can make the ball into a key to unlock something. I'm not sure yet.

Let me try to move towards the key first. It's 1 step to the left, so I'll go left. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule, like ""key is win"" or something like that.

But I'm not sure if I can move the key yet. Maybe I need to break down the existing rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make the walls passable. Or perhaps I can make the walls into something else, like ""wall is push"" so I can push them.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule near the key to create a new rule. For example, if I can place ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I could make ""key is win,"" which would mean picking up the key would win the level.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is key"" so I can pick up the key and then use it to change another rule. That might be a way to unlock the win condition.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key and then see how I can use it to change the rules. Let me try moving left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right, so it's pretty close. There's a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules are spread out, with ""is"" and ""win"" rules further to the right. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one down, which could be important.

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I have to avoid walls unless I can change the rules. The ""stop"" rule is nearby, so maybe I can use that to make something stop moving or block something else.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what counts as a wall. But I'm not sure how that would help yet. The key is close, so maybe I should pick it up first. If I have the key, perhaps I can unlock something or change a rule that involves the key.

The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right and one up. That's pretty far. Maybe I need to create a new rule that makes something else the win condition, or find a way to move the win rule closer.

I also see a ball three steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right and one up. If I can move that, I can create new rules. For example, if I make ""key is win,"" then the key would become the win condition, which is much closer. That could be a good strategy.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 1 up. So they're next to each other. If I can move the key next to them, I can form ""key is win.""

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, but that might not be necessary if I can make the key win.

Let me plan the steps. First, I need to move towards the key. It's one step to the right, so I can move right once to pick it up. Then, I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule closer to the key. But how?

Wait, I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. The ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I can move that, maybe I can block something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Another idea: if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can change what's considered a wall. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, which they already do, but maybe that's not helpful. Or if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become controllable, but that might not be useful here.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule to create ""key is win."" That way, when I have the key, I can win by being near it.

So, step by step:

1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Then, move towards the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to reposition them next to the key.

But wait, can I carry the key while moving? In Baba Is You, when you pick up an object, you can carry it with you. So yes, moving right would let me pick up the key, and then I can move the key to where I need it.

So, first action: move right to pick up the key.

After that, I need to move the key to the position where the ""is"" and ""win"" rules are. The ""is"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up, and ""win"" is at 10 right, 1 up. So if I move the key to 9 right, 1 up, then I can form ""key is win"" by placing the key next to ""is"" and ""win.""

But how do I get the key there? I need to move right multiple times, but I have to avoid walls. The wall is at 5 right, 1 up, so I can go around it by moving down or up.

Wait, the wall is at 5 right, 1 up, but I'm starting at 0,0. So moving right 5 steps would hit the wall. Maybe I can go down first to avoid it.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the wall by changing its rule. If I can make ""wall is break,"" then I can destroy it. But I don't see a ""break"" rule here. The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball.""

Hmm, maybe I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would mean walls stop movement, but that's their default behavior. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control the walls, but that might not help me get past them.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall's position to make the wall stop me, but that's already the case.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on creating a new rule with the key. If I can make ""key is win,"" then having the key would let me win.

So, to do that, I need to have the key, the ""is"" rule, and the ""win"" rule all adjacent in the order key-is-win.

I have the key at 1 right. The ""is"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up, and ""win"" is at 10 right, 1 up. So I need to move the key to 9 right, 1 up, then place ""is"" and ""win"" next to it.

But moving the key that far would require moving through walls, which I can't do unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules closer to the key. But how?

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move it left to 1 right, then I can form ""key is win"" by placing ""is"" and ""win"" next to the key.

But moving the ""is"" rule would require moving it from 9 right, 1 up to 1 right, 1 up. That's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls along the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 1 up. If I can move it to 2 right, 1 up, then I can have key-is-win by placing ""is"" at 1 right, 1 up.

But again, moving rules requires moving them step by step, which might not be feasible due to walls.

Another idea: use the ball. The ball is three steps down. If I can push the ball to break through walls or move rules, that might help. But I'm not sure how to use it here.

Wait, the ball is at 3 down. If I can move the ball to hit the wall, maybe it can break it. But I don't see a ""break"" rule, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball push the wall. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then the ball can push the wall out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 1 down. If I can move that to block the wall, maybe I can create a path.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving right to pick up the key first, as that seems like a necessary step.

So, first action: move right to pick up the key.

After that, I can plan the next steps based on how the map changes.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There are walls positioned at various points, which could block my path or require me to move around them. The rules are spread out, and I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which might allow me to create new rules by moving them.

I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to my advantage. Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can rearrange them to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to something else, I might be able to make the key do something different, like become a win condition or a stopper.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to block certain paths or prevent myself from moving into dangerous areas. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, which is pretty far. I wonder if I can create a shortcut by changing the rules.

I also see a ball object. Maybe if I can make the ball do something, like become a key or a win condition, that could help. The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down, so it's somewhere on the lower right.

I think the key is to move the ""is"" rules to create new combinations. For example, if I can move an ""is"" next to ""win"" and another word, I might redefine the win condition. Alternatively, I could make the key into a win condition by placing ""key is win.""

But first, I need to get to the key. It's 1 step to the left, so maybe I should move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can use it to open locks or perhaps change rules that require it.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, the key might not be a traditional key. It could be part of a rule. So maybe moving the key next to an ""is"" and another word could change its property. For example, ""key is win"" would make the key the win condition.

I should also consider the walls. If I can make walls stop me or become passable, that would help. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change the wall's properties.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the key. Since it's 1 step to the left, I'll go left. Then, I can see if I can manipulate the rules around it. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to win by picking up the key.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the key directly, I might need to break through walls by changing their properties. For example, if I can make walls stop being walls, I can pass through them.

I also notice that the ""stop"" rule is nearby. If I can move that, I might be able to prevent myself from moving into certain areas or create a barrier to control my movement.

Another idea: if I can make myself into a key, then I can use myself as the key to open whatever is needed. That would involve creating a rule like ""baba is key."" Since I'm already ""baba is you,"" adding ""baba is key"" would make me both you and a key.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to an ""is"" and ""baba."" But where are those? The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. The ""is"" rules are spread out, but one is 3 steps down and another is 6 steps down.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 3 steps down next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to create ""baba is key."" That would allow me to become a key.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule next to an ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you,"" which would let me switch places with the key.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key and then manipulate the rules to either make the key the win condition or make myself into a key. That way, I can reach the win object or redefine what wins.

So, first step: move left to get the key. Then, use the key to manipulate rules or make myself a key. Once I have that, I can proceed to the win condition.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be blocked by walls. Let me check the walls' positions. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and others at various points. I need to make sure my path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up or down to avoid walls. The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used in some way, but I'm not sure yet.

I think the key is the immediate priority. So, I'll move left to get the key. Once I have it, I can see what rules I can change.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the right. There are walls at various positions, which I can't pass through unless I change the rules. There are also several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" These can be moved to create or modify rules.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right. If I can get to that position, maybe I can change the win condition. But first, I need to figure out how to move the rule blocks.

The key is nearby, one step to the right. Maybe I can pick it up or use it somehow. But since I'm Baba, I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" I see a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down. If I can move that, I might be able to create a path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (2,1). If I move it somewhere else, maybe I can make the walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that changes the properties of the walls.

I also see a ""ball"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I combine that with another rule, I can make the ball do something useful, like push objects.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the ""is"" rule at 9 steps to the right. If I can get there, I can create a new rule. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make the walls stop being walls.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, allowing me to pass through walls. Or perhaps I can make the key into something else, like a ""WIN"" object.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move that to the ""win"" position, maybe I can change the win condition to the key. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Another idea: if I can make Baba into a ""WIN"" object, then wherever I am becomes the win condition. But how? I need to create a rule like ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to Baba.

But right now, the ""is"" rule is at 9 steps to the right, and ""win"" is at 10 steps. If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to Baba, and then the ""win"" rule next to that, I can create ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition, so I just need to reach myself, which I already am. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ""is"" rule, and then move the ""baba"" rule next to that. So ""baba is win."" Then, wherever I am, that's the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the right way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into a ""WIN"" object. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""win"" rule next to that, I can create ""key is win."" Then, I just need to pick up the key to win.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move them if they're not ""STOP."" The ""stop"" rule is at (2,1). If I can move that, I can free up the rule blocks.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move any object that isn't ""STOP."" So I can move the ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" rules. The ""stop"" rule is at (2,1), so I can move that as well.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ""is"" rule at 9 steps to the right. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make the walls passable.

If I move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, the walls might stop being walls. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to be next to the ""stop"" rule, making ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me. But I want the opposite; I want to pass through walls.

Alternatively, if I can make walls into something else, like ""air,"" but I don't see an ""air"" rule. Maybe I can make walls into ""push"" or something.

Wait, I see a ""ball"" rule at 3 steps down. If I can make the ball into a ""push"" object, I can use it to push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make the walls into ""move"" objects. If I can create a rule like ""wall is move,"" then I can move the walls.

But how? I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""move"" rule next to that. But I don't see a ""move"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, making ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me. But I want to pass through them, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make walls into ""air,"" but I don't have an ""air"" rule. Maybe I can make walls into ""you,"" but that might not help.

Wait, another approach: if I can make the key into a ""WIN"" object, then I just need to pick it up. So I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""win"" rule next to that, creating ""key is win."" Then, when I pick up the key, I win.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I need to get to them. The ""is"" rule is at 9 steps to the right. I'm currently at (0,0). Let me see the path.

From (0,0), I can move right to (1,0), but there's a wall at (5,0). So I can't go straight right. Maybe I can go down first.

Looking at the map, there's a ""stop"" rule at (2,1). If I can move that, I can create a path. Let me try moving down.

From (0,0), I can move down to (0,1). Then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (5,1). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule at (2,1) to somewhere else, allowing me to pass. If I move it to (2,2), then the path at (2,1) is clear.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it. So I need to get to (2,1). To get there, I have to go right twice and down once.

From (0,0), right to (1,0), right to (2,0), but there's a wall at (5,0). Wait, no, the wall is at (5,0). So from (0,0), I can go right to (1,0), right to (2,0), right to (3,0), right to (4,0), right to (5,0), but that's a wall. So I can't go beyond (4,0).

Wait, maybe I can go down first. From (0,0), down to (0,1). Then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (5,1). Hmm.

Alternatively, from (0,0), right to (1,0), right to (2,0), right to (3,0), right to (4,0), then down to (4,1). Then right to (5,1), but that's a wall. So I can't go further.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. If I can make walls into ""air,"" but I don't have an ""air"" rule. Alternatively, make walls into ""move.""

Wait, I see a ""ball"" rule at (0,3). If I can make the ball into a ""push"" object, I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make the walls into ""you,"" so I can walk through them. If I create a rule like ""wall is you,"" then walls become passable.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""you"" rule next to that. The ""you"" rule is at (2,6). So I need to get the ""wall"" rule to (x,y) where ""is"" is at (x+1,y), and ""you"" is at (x+2,y).

But the ""is"" rule is at (9,0). So I need to move the ""wall"" rule to (7,0), then ""is"" at (8,0), and ""you"" at (9,0). But that's a long way.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule closer. The ""is"" rule is at (9,0). I can move it to (2,0), making ""wall is you"" if I place ""you"" next to it.

Wait, let me think. If I move the ""is"" rule to (2,0), then I can place the ""wall"" rule at (1,0) and the ""you"" rule at (3,0), creating ""wall is you."" That would make walls passable.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it. The ""is"" rule is at (9,0). I'm at (0,0). I can't reach it directly because of the walls.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another way. Let's look at the ""key"" rule at (8,3). If I can make the key into a ""WIN"" object, then I just need to pick it up.

To do that, I need to create ""key is win."" So I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""win"" rule next to that.

The ""is"" rule is at (9,0), and the ""win"" rule is at (10,0). So if I move the ""key"" rule to (8,0), then ""is"" at (9,0), and ""win"" at (10,0), that would create ""key is win.""

But again, I can't reach the ""is"" rule because of the walls. Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I can make the ball into a ""push"" object, I can push the walls aside. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, make the ball into a ""move"" object.

If I can create ""ball is move,"" then the ball can be moved, and I can use it to push walls. But I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""move"" rule next to that. But I don't have a ""move"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule to create a path. The ""stop"" rule is at (2,1). If I move it to (2,2), then the path at (2,1) is clear, allowing me to go right past it.

So, from (0,0), I can go right to (1,0), right to (2,0), then down to (2,1) to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then move it to (2,2). Now, the path at (2,1) is clear.

Then, I can go right to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0) is a wall, so I can't go further right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can go down from (5,0) to (5,1), but that's a wall. No, the wall is at (5,0). So from (4,0), I can go down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), but that's a wall. So I can't go beyond (4,1).

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at the ""baba"" rule at (6,0). If I can make Baba into something else, like ""WIN,"" then I can win immediately.

To do that, I need to create ""baba is win."" So I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""win"" rule next to that.

The ""baba"" rule is at (6,0). The ""is"" rule is at (9,0). The ""win"" rule is at (10,0). So if I move the ""baba"" rule to (8,0), then ""is"" at (9,0), and ""win"" at (10,0), that would create ""baba is win.""

But again, I can't reach the ""is"" rule because of the walls. Maybe I need to find a way to move the walls.

Wait, I see a ""wall"" rule at (1,2). If I can move that, I can change the properties of walls. For example, if I make ""wall is move,"" then walls can be moved.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""move"" rule next to that. But I don't have a ""move"" rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is air,"" but I don't have an ""air"" rule. Maybe I can make ""wall is push,"" but again, no ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I can make the ball into a ""push"" object, I can push walls. But I don't have a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, make the ball into a ""move"" object.

If I can create ""ball is move,"" then I can move the ball to push walls. But I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""move"" rule next to that. But I don't have a ""move"" rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the key is at (1,0). If I can pick it up, maybe it can help me in some way. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, if I can make the key into a ""WIN"" object, then picking it up would win the level. So I need to create ""key is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""win"" rule next to that.

The ""key"" rule is at (8,3). The ""is"" rule is at (9,0). The ""win"" rule is at (10,0). So I need to move the ""key"" rule to (8,0), then ""is"" at (9,0), and ""win"" at (10,0). That would create ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it. The ""key"" rule is at (8,3). I'm at (0,0). I can't reach it because of the walls.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer. If I can move the ""is"" rule to (8,3), then I can place the ""key"" rule at (7,3) and the ""win"" rule at (9,3), creating ""key is win.""

But I can't reach the ""is"" rule because of the walls. This is a dead end.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" rule. If I can make the ball into a ""push"" object, I can push walls to create a path. But I don't have a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, make the ball into a ""move"" object.

If I can create ""ball is move,"" then I can move the ball to push walls. But I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""move"" rule next to that. But I don't have a ""move"" rule.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think outside the box. What if I make the ""stop"" rule into something else, like ""stop is air,"" so it doesn't block me anymore.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""air"" rule next to that. But I don't have an ""air"" rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can make ""stop is move,"" allowing me to move the ""stop"" rule. But I don't have a ""move"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""stop is you,"" so the ""stop"" rule becomes passable. Then I can move through it.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""you"" rule next to that. The ""you"" rule is at (2,6). So I need to get the ""stop"" rule to (x,y), ""is"" at (x+1,y), and ""you"" at (x+2,y).

But the ""is"" rule is at (9,0), and ""you"" is at (2,6). That's too far apart.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule to create a path. The ""stop"" rule is at (2,1). If I can move it to (2,2), then I can go right past (2,1).

So, from (0,0), I can go right to (1,0), right to (2,0), then down to (2,1) to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then move it to (2,2). Now, the path at (2,1) is clear.

Then, I can go right to (3,0), (4,0), (5,0) is a wall, so I can't go further right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can go down from (5,0) to (5,1), but that's a","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the right, a wall five steps to the right, and various rules scattered around. The rules include ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right. That's pretty far. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one down, which might block my path. The ""wall"" rule is two steps down, which could be useful if I can move it. 

The ball is three steps down, and there's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and six down. 

I think I should start by moving right to get closer to the key and the win condition. But I need to be careful about the walls and the stop rule. If I move right, I might hit the wall or the stop. Maybe I can move down first to avoid obstacles.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to create a path. But I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So I need to see if the wall is movable. Since the rule is ""wall,"" it's probably a wall object, which is usually stoppable. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. If I can move the ""is"" rule, I might change the properties of other objects. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" I could control the key and use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me try moving right first. If I go right, I might reach the key or the wall. But if the wall is in the way, I can't pass. Maybe I should move down to get around. The ball is three steps down, so maybe I can use it somehow. But I'm not sure what the ball does.

Another idea: if I can get to the ""is"" rule, I can combine it with other objects to create new rules. For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""you"" forms the rule ""baba is you,"" which is already active. Maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" to make the key the win condition, which would make it easier to win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and three down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can work towards it.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win"" or something else. But I'm not sure. Let me try moving right first to see what happens. If I hit a wall or stop, I'll adjust.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one down. If I move right twice and down once, I might trigger the stop. I don't want that. Maybe I should move down first to avoid it.

So, I'll try moving down. That way, I can avoid the stop and maybe reach the ball or other rules. If I move down, I can then move right towards the key and win.

Let me try moving down. That should help me navigate around the obstacles and get closer to the win condition. Once I'm down, I can reassess the situation and decide the next move.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is one step to the right and one step up from my current position. There's also a ""WIN"" rule 10 steps to the right and one step up. That seems pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can change how the walls behave. The walls are mostly blocking the way, but if I can make them stop me or not, that could help. There's also a ""wall"" rule one step down, which might be useful for creating or removing walls.

The ball is two steps down, and there's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and two steps down. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something or change a rule. The ""baba"" rule is five steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and five steps down. If I can move these, I might be able to change who I am or what I can do.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls stop me or let me pass. If I can move the ""stop"" rule onto a wall, maybe that wall will stop me, allowing me to push it or something. Alternatively, if I can make the walls not stop me, I can move through them.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. It's two steps to the right. If I move right twice, I can pick it up. Then, I can move it to a wall. But wait, I need to make sure I can move the ""stop"" rule. Since it's a rule, I can move it as long as it's not attached to something else.

Once I have the ""stop"" rule, I can place it on a wall to make that wall stop me. Then, maybe I can push the wall to clear a path. Alternatively, if I can make the walls not stop me, I can walk through them.

Another idea is to use the key. The key is one step to the right and one step up. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock a door or change a rule that requires a key. But I'm not sure how the key interacts with the rules yet.

I also see a ""ball"" rule eight steps to the right and five steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure. I need to focus on the immediate obstacles first.

Let me plan my moves. I'll start by moving right twice to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move down to place it on a wall. Once the wall stops me, I can push it to create a path. After that, I can move towards the key and then towards the ""WIN"" rule.

Wait, but I need to make sure I can move the ""stop"" rule without getting stuck. Maybe I should first move up to avoid any immediate walls. Let me check the layout again. The walls are mostly to the right and down, so moving up might give me more space.

Alternatively, I could move left to see if there's a different path, but the key is to the right, so I probably need to go that way. I think the best approach is to get the ""stop"" rule, place it on a wall, and then push the wall to clear the path towards the key and the win condition.

So, my first move should be to move right twice to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move down to place it on a wall. After that, I can push the wall to create a path. Once the path is clear, I can move towards the key and then proceed to the ""WIN"" rule.

I need to make sure I don't get stuck along the way. Maybe after placing the ""stop"" rule, I can test if the wall stops me. If it does, I can push it. If not, I might need to adjust my strategy.

Another consideration is the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules. If I can change who I am, I might gain different abilities. For example, if I can make myself a ball, I could potentially push objects. But that might complicate things, so I'll focus on the immediate goal first.

In summary, my plan is:
1. Move right twice to get the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move down to place it on a wall.
3. Push the wall to clear the path.
4. Move towards the key.
5. Proceed to the ""WIN"" rule.

I think this should work, but I need to execute it carefully to avoid getting stuck or missing a step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the Win condition, which is usually a rule like ""WIN is win,"" but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is one step up from my current position. There's a wall four steps to the right and one step up, which might block my path. The rule ""is"" is eight steps to the right and one step up, and ""win"" is nine steps to the right and one step up. That suggests that the Win rule is far to the right, beyond the wall.

I also notice a ""stop"" rule one step to the right. If I move right, I might trigger that, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to be careful about that. The wall four steps to the right is directly in front of me, so moving right from my current position would take me into the wall, which I can't pass through because walls are typically stop objects.

The ball is one step to the left and two steps down. I'm not sure if the ball is relevant here, but maybe it can be used to change some rules. The key is one step up, so perhaps I need to pick it up to unlock something. But since the key is up, I might need to move up first.

Wait, if I move up, I can get the key. But then, what's the point of the key? Maybe it's needed to open a door or change a rule. Let me think about the rules. There's a ""wall"" rule one step to the left and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can remove the wall blocking my path.

But how do I move the wall rule? I need to be adjacent to it. The wall rule is one step to the left and one step down from my current position. So if I move left and down, I can reach it. But moving left would take me away from the key. Maybe I should first move up to get the key, then see what options I have.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to access the wall rule. If I move down, I can get closer to the wall rule. Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting point. Moving up gets me the key. Moving right hits the wall. Moving down takes me towards the wall rule and the ball.

If I move down, I can reach the wall rule. If I can move the wall rule, perhaps I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I make the wall into something else, like a pushable object, I can move it out of the way. But how?

The wall rule is ""wall is wall."" If I can change that, maybe I can make the wall into something else. For instance, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the wall. But to do that, I need to have the ""push"" rule somewhere. I don't see a ""push"" rule in the current objects, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the wall rule by moving the ""is"" or ""wall"" parts. If I can separate them, the rule might change. For example, if I move the ""is"" part away from ""wall,"" the rule might no longer hold, making the walls passable.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" at eight steps to the right and one step up. That's the same as the ""is"" rule. If I can move that closer, maybe I can form a new rule. But that seems too far away.

Wait, the key is one step up. Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or to change a rule that requires a key. For example, if there's a ""key is open"" rule, then having the key would allow me to open something. But I don't see that rule yet.

Let me think about the ball. The ball is one step to the left and two steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something. If I can move the ball into a position where it can push a wall or a rule, that might help.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move up to get the key. Then, see if the key can be used to change a rule.
2. Move down to access the wall rule and see if I can modify it.
3. Try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the wall passable.

Option 1: Moving up to get the key. After getting the key, I can check if there's a rule involving the key. If there's a ""key is open"" rule, then I can open a door or something. But I don't see that rule yet. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to pick up another rule.

Option 2: Moving down to the wall rule. If I can move the wall rule, perhaps I can change it. For example, if I move the ""wall"" part to another ""is"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""wall is push."" But I need to see if there's another ""is"" rule nearby.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at eight steps to the right and one step up, which is far. There's also a ""rule `is`"" at two steps down. Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at two steps down. So if I move down, I can reach the ""is"" rule. Then, I can combine it with the wall rule.

So, if I move down, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to the wall rule. That would create a new rule ""wall is [something]."" If I can make it ""wall is push,"" then I can push the wall. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule either.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would mean the walls are me, but that doesn't make sense. Or ""wall is win,"" which would make the walls the win condition, but that's not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the immediate steps. I need to get past the wall to reach the Win rule. The wall is four steps to the right. If I can move the wall, I can create a path.

But how? Maybe I can use the ball to push the wall. The ball is one step to the left and two steps down. If I can move the ball to the right, it might push the wall. But I need to get the ball into position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to make the wall passable. If I can change the wall's property, I can walk through it.

Wait, the wall rule is ""wall is wall."" If I can move the ""is"" part away, the rule becomes ""wall is [nothing],"" which might make the walls passable. So, I need to move the ""is"" part of the wall rule away.

The wall rule is at one step to the left and one step down. The ""is"" rule is at two steps down. So, if I move the ""is"" part from the wall rule to the ""is"" rule, I can break the wall rule.

But how do I do that? I need to be adjacent to the wall rule to move it. So, I should move down to reach it.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move down to reach the wall rule.
2. Move the ""is"" part of the wall rule down to the existing ""is"" rule.
3. This would break the wall rule, making the walls passable.

But wait, moving the ""is"" part might not be straightforward. I need to make sure that when I move the ""is"" part, it forms a new rule with something else.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" part to another ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to the ""win"" rule, I can make ""wall is win,"" which would make the walls the win condition. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push the wall. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing parts. For example, if I have ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""is is you,"" which might change the rules in a way that helps.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to focus on the immediate goal: getting past the wall to reach the Win rule.

If I can make the wall passable, I can move right past it. So, I need to break the wall rule.

To do that, I can move the ""is"" part of the wall rule away. So, I need to move down to the wall rule, then move the ""is"" part down to the existing ""is"" rule.

Let me try that.

First, I'm at the starting position. I need to move down to reach the wall rule. So, I'll move down once.

Now, I'm at the position where the wall rule is. I can see the ""wall"" and ""is"" parts. I need to move the ""is"" part down to the existing ""is"" rule, which is two steps down from my current position.

So, I'll move the ""is"" part down twice. That should place it next to the existing ""is"" rule, breaking the wall rule.

After that, the walls should become passable. Then, I can move right past the wall to reach the Win rule.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" part might not be that simple. I need to make sure that when I move it, it forms a new rule. If I move the ""is"" part to the existing ""is"" rule, it might create a rule like ""is is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" part to another ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""wall"" next to the ""win"" rule would make ""wall is win,"" which would make the walls the win condition. But that's not helpful because I need to reach the Win rule.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently.

What if I move the ""win"" rule closer? The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition.

For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. But I need to have the ball and the ""is"" and ""win"" parts together.

The ball is one step to the left and two steps down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's too far to combine them.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" which would mean I am the win condition. But that's already the case because ""baba is you,"" and ""you"" is me. So, that might not help.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. The Win rule is ""win is win,"" which is the default. So, I need to reach the Win rule.

But the wall is blocking my path. So, I need to either break the wall rule or find another way around.

Another idea: maybe I can use the key to change a rule. The key is one step up. If I pick up the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule that requires a key.

But I don't see a door or a rule that involves the key. The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps down. That's far, but maybe if I can move the key rule closer, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to pick up another rule. For example, if I have the key, I can pick up the ""key"" rule and move it to create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move up to get the key first.

So, I'll move up once to pick up the key. Now, I have the key. What can I do with it? Maybe I can use it to change a rule.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move that closer, I can create a new rule involving the key.

But that's too far. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining the key with an ""is"" rule.

The ""is"" rule is at two steps down. So, if I move the key down twice, I can create a rule like ""key is [something].""

But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. But I already have the key, so that might not help.

Alternatively, ""key is push,"" which would allow me to push the key. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think of another approach.

What if I move the ""you"" rule? The ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and five steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what ""you"" is.

But I'm not sure. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. Changing ""you"" might affect that.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" which would mean I am the win condition. But that's already the case because ""baba is you,"" and ""you"" is me.

Wait, no. The win condition is ""win is win."" So, I need to reach the Win rule. If I can make ""you is win,"" then being me would satisfy the win condition, so I would win immediately. But I don't know if that's possible.

To make ""you is win,"" I need to have the ""you"" and ""win"" parts together with an ""is"" rule. The ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and five steps down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's too far to combine them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. But that's also too far.

Let me go back to the wall problem. The wall is four steps to the right. If I can make the wall passable, I can move right past it.

To do that, I need to break the wall rule. The wall rule is ""wall is wall."" If I can move the ""is"" part away, the rule becomes ""wall is [nothing],"" which might make the walls passable.

So, I need to move the ""is"" part of the wall rule to another location. The wall rule is one step to the left and one step down. The ""is"" rule is two steps down. So, if I move the ""is"" part down once, it would be next to the existing ""is"" rule, creating ""is is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" part to another ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""wall"" next to the ""win"" rule would make ""wall is win,"" which would make the walls the win condition. But that's not helpful because I need to reach the Win rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is push."" If I can do that, I can push the wall to move it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. So, that's not possible.

Another idea: maybe I can use the ball to push the wall. The ball is one step to the left and two steps down. If I can move the ball to the right, it might push the wall.

But how? I need to get the ball into position. Let me try to move down to get the ball.

So, I'll move down twice to reach the ball. Now, I'm at the ball's position. I can pick up the ball and move it to the right.

But moving the ball right would take it into the wall. If the ball can push the wall, then the wall would move. But I don't know if that's possible without changing the wall's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball to the right and up, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize:

- I need to reach the Win rule, which is far to the right.
- The wall is blocking my path.
- I can try to break the wall rule by moving its ""is"" part.
- Alternatively, I can try to use the key or the ball to change something.

I think the most straightforward approach is to break the wall rule. So, I'll move down to the wall rule and try to move the ""is"" part away.

So, my first move is to move down once to reach the wall rule. Then, I'll move the ""is"" part down to the existing ""is"" rule. That should break the wall rule, making the walls passable.

After that, I can move right past the wall and proceed towards the Win rule.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" part might not be that simple. I need to make sure that when I move it, it forms a new rule. If I move the ""is"" part to the existing ""is"" rule, it might create ""is is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" part to another ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""wall"" next to the ""win"" rule would make ""wall is win,"" which would make the walls the win condition. But that's not helpful because I need to reach the Win rule.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach.

What if I move the ""stop"" rule? The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right. If I can move it away, I can prevent myself from stopping when I move right.

But I'm not sure. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right. If I can move it down, maybe I can avoid triggering it when I move right.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""stop is nothing,"" which would remove the stop effect. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving its parts. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right. If I can move the ""is"" part away, the rule becomes ""stop is [nothing],"" which might remove the stop effect.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" rule to move it. It's two steps to the right, which is beyond the wall. So, I can't reach it without moving past the wall.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key one step up. There's also a wall four steps to the right and one step up. The rules section shows several ""is"" rules, a ""win"" rule nine steps to the right and one step up, a ""stop"" rule one step to the right, and other objects like ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" placed at various positions.

Hmm, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. That probably means if I move right, I'll hit a stop, which might prevent me from moving further in that direction. I need to be careful about that.

I notice there's a ""key"" object one step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how do I get there? Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I have to avoid the walls and the stop rule.

Let me visualize the map. Starting from my position, moving up one step gets me to the key. But if I move right, I might hit the wall or the stop rule. Maybe I should move up first to get the key.

Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I move right, I'll stop, which might not be helpful. Maybe I should move up to get the key first, then see what else I can do.

After getting the key, perhaps I can use it to change a rule. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I might create a new rule like ""key is something."" That could help me unlock the win condition or change the rules to make the level easier.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition to something closer.

I also see a ""ball"" object two steps down and one step to the left. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule when moved.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and five steps down. Maybe if I can move the ball next to ""is,"" I can create a new rule involving the ball.

But first things first, I need to get the key. So, moving up one step to get the key seems like a good start. Once I have the key, I can look for opportunities to change rules by moving the key next to ""is"" or other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule out of the way. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I can move it somewhere else, I can move right without stopping.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to have control over it, which I don't right now. Maybe if I change the rules to make ""stop"" something else, I can move it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I move right, I'll hit the stop, which might prevent me from moving further. So, maybe I should move up first to get the key, then see if I can manipulate the rules.

So, the plan is: move up to get the key, then use the key to change a rule, possibly making the win condition easier or moving the stop rule out of the way.

But I'm not sure if moving up is the best first step. Maybe I should explore other options. For example, moving right might lead me to the wall, but if I can move the wall, I might create a path.

Wait, the wall is four steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the wall, I can create a path to the right. But how? I need to change the wall's properties.

Maybe if I can make the wall ""is push"" or something, I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, if I can make the wall ""is nothing,"" it might disappear.

But I don't have the necessary rules set up for that yet. So, perhaps getting the key first is better.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to create a new rule like ""win is something,"" but that might not help directly.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and one step up. That's quite far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""baba is win,"" so I can win by being myself. But how?

I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba."" But that's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use the key to change a rule that allows me to win without moving so far.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key ""is win,"" so picking up the key would make me win. That could be a way.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" But the ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right and two steps down. That's also a bit far.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving up to get the key first, then see if I can manipulate the rules from there.

So, the first action should be to move up to get the key. That way, I can have the key to change rules later.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the right. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and another wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right, and ""win"" 9 steps to the right. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down.

Hmm, the ""stop"" rule is probably making the wall immovable. I need to get past the walls to reach the win. The key is nearby, so maybe I can use it to unlock something. But how?

I see a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe if I move the key there, it can change the rule. Or perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the wall passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. If I make ""wall is push"" or something, I could push through them.

But I'm not sure. Let me think step by step. First, I need to get closer to the key. It's 1 step to the right, so I can move right to pick it up. Then, maybe I can use the key to interact with other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can reach it. But how? I need to manipulate the rules to make that happen.

Another idea: the ""stop"" rule is making the wall stop me. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the wall won't stop me anymore. So, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, making the wall passable.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to have control over it, which I don't right now. Maybe if I change the rules so that I can push it.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that makes the wall passable. For example, ""wall is push"" would allow me to push through walls. But I need to find a way to create that rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""ball"" 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can help me in some way, like pushing rules around.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move the ball there, maybe it can trigger a rule change.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down. My main goal is to reach the win condition. The win is 9 steps to the right, which is far. But maybe I can change the win condition to something closer.

If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But how?

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the right. Maybe I can use the key to unlock the ""win"" rule. If I pick up the key and then move it next to the ""win"" rule, maybe it will change the rule.

But I'm not sure how the key interacts with rules. Maybe the key is needed to move certain rules.

Another approach: the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that rule away, the wall won't stop me. So, I can move right to the key, then down to the stop rule, and move it somewhere else.

But I need to plan the steps carefully. Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Move down to the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, making the wall passable.
4. Then, move right through the wall to reach the win.

But I'm not sure if moving the ""stop"" rule will work. Maybe I need to create a new rule instead.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" to make ""wall is push.""

But I need to see if that's possible. Let me check the positions. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position, I can create ""wall is something.""

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move one step at a time. I need to plan how to get the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the key first and see what happens. Let's try moving right to pick up the key.

After moving right, I have the key. Now, what can I do with it? Maybe I can use it to move other rules. For example, moving the key next to the ""stop"" rule to deactivate it.

Alternatively, I can use the key to move the ""win"" rule closer. But I'm not sure how.

Another idea: the ""ball"" is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push rules around. If I can move the ball to the ""stop"" rule, it might push it away.

But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with rules. Maybe the ball can be used to create new rules.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move the ball there, it might change the rule to ""ball is something.""

This is getting too vague. Let me try to focus on the immediate steps. I have the key, so maybe I can use it to unlock the ""win"" rule. Let me move right again to get closer to the ""win"" rule.

But the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, which is too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the win condition closer.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule to make myself the win condition. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""win,"" it might make ""you is win.""

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving the key next to the ""stop"" rule to see if it does something.

After moving right to get the key, I can move down to the ""stop"" rule. Then, maybe moving the key next to it will deactivate the stop, making the wall passable.

Alternatively, moving the key next to the ""stop"" rule might change the rule to ""stop is key,"" which could have some effect.

I think I'll try that. So, the steps would be:

1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Move down to the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the key next to the ""stop"" rule to change the rule.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it to make ""wall is push,"" I can push through the walls.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I need to have control over it, which I don't right now. Maybe if I change the rules to make ""wall is push,"" I can push through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is making the wall stop me. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the wall won't stop me anymore. So, moving the ""stop"" rule to a different location might help.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to another rule to change it.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the win condition. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win immediately.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But it's too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""baba is win"" without moving the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is something,"" but I need to see.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move it next to ""win,"" which is 9 steps to the right, I can create ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is something."" But ""baba is you"" is already the active rule.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. The key is 1 step to the right. Maybe I can use it to unlock the ""win"" rule. Let me try moving right to pick up the key.

After moving right, I have the key. Now, what can I do with it? Maybe I can use it to move the ""win"" rule closer. Let me try moving the key next to the ""win"" rule.

But the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, which is too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the win condition closer.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule to make the key do something else. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move the key there, it might change the rule.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving the key next to the ""stop"" rule to see if it deactivates the stop.

So, after picking up the key, I move down to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I move the key next to it. Maybe that changes the rule to ""stop is key,"" which could allow me to pass through the wall.

Alternatively, moving the key next to the ""stop"" rule might remove the stop effect, making the wall passable.

I think I'll try that. So, the steps would be:

1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Move down to the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the key next to the ""stop"" rule to change the rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's near me. There are walls to the right, which might block my path. The rules are spread out, with ""is"" and ""win"" rules further to the right. There's also a ""stop"" rule one step down, which could be important.

I think the key might be useful. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. The walls are in the way, but if I can move the rules, I might be able to change the properties of the walls or the key.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can get there, that might be the goal. But there are walls blocking the path. Maybe I can break the walls by changing their properties. For example, if I can make the walls ""stop"" or something else, they might become passable.

I also notice a ""ball"" object three steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push things or break walls. Maybe I can use the ball to clear a path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. Or perhaps I can create a new rule that changes the walls into something else.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, and ""win"" is eight steps to the right. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""win is something,"" which could change the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule next to the key object to make it ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key and maybe use it to unlock something.

But first, I need to get to the key. It's one step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to break through a wall or reach the win condition.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving away from the win condition. Maybe I should instead focus on moving the rules around to change the environment.

Another idea: if I can make the walls ""stop,"" then I can walk through them. Or if I can make the walls ""you,"" they would become part of me, but that might not help.

I think the best first step is to move towards the key. Let me try moving left to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can see if it can be used to unlock a path to the win condition.

So, I'll choose to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which is close to me. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and various rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" scattered around.

I think the first step is to understand the current setup. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to see if there are any obstacles or rules that can help me. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down, which might block movement in that area. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, so that could be a barrier.

I notice there's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. But how do I get there? There are walls in the way, so I might need to change the rules to move through them.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make the walls passable. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to say ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me anymore. But how do I do that?

I need to move the ""wall"" rule. It's currently 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. To move it, I have to be adjacent to it. So I should move towards it. Let me plan my steps:

1. Move left to get closer to the ""wall"" rule.
2. Once adjacent, move the rule up or down to change its position.
3. Change the rule to make walls passable.

But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. The key is 1 step to the left, so maybe I should pick up the key first. If I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or something else. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe the key is for a different purpose.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the ""win"" rule, which is 9 steps to the right. If I can reach that, I might win the level. But there are walls and the ""stop"" rule in the way. I need to find a way to bypass them.

Let me think about the rules again. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that rule, I can prevent it from stopping me. Maybe I can move it to a different location or change it to something else.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to move towards the ""wall"" rule to change it. To do that, I should move left to get closer. So, my first action should be to move left.

After moving left, I'll be next to the ""wall"" rule. Then, I can move the rule up or down to change its position. If I move it up, it might not block me anymore. Alternatively, I can change the rule to ""wall is not stop,"" making walls passable.

Once the walls are passable, I can move right towards the ""win"" rule. But I also need to consider the ""stop"" rule. If I can move that as well, I can ensure nothing is stopping me from reaching the win.

Alternatively, maybe I should pick up the key first. If I move right, I can get the key, which might be necessary for something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so moving left would take me towards it. Maybe I should pick it up first. If I have the key, perhaps I can unlock a path or a rule.

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Let me think about the rules again. The ""key"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe that's a rule I can change to make the key do something else, like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition.

If I can change the ""key"" rule to ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. That could be a quick way to solve the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule. It's 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's quite far. I need to find a path there, possibly by changing other rules first.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""key,"" I can form ""key is something,"" which could change its properties.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me try to prioritize.

1. Move left to get closer to the ""wall"" rule.
2. Change the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable.
3. Move right towards the ""win"" rule, using the key if necessary.

Alternatively, if I can't get through the walls, I might need to find another way. Maybe using the ball to break through or change rules.

Wait, the ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. If I can move the ball, maybe I can use it to push something or change a rule.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to focus on the walls first. If I can make walls passable, I can move freely.

So, my plan is:

- Move left to reach the ""wall"" rule.
- Change the ""wall"" rule to ""wall is not stop.""
- Then, move right towards the ""win"" rule.

Let me try that.

First, I need to move left. So, my action should be ""left.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right, which is close. There's a wall five steps to the right, so I can't go straight right because of that. The rule ""is"" is nine steps to the right, and ""win"" is ten steps to the right. That seems far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to get there.

There's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down. That might block my movement if I'm not careful. The wall is five steps to the right and one step down, so that's another obstacle. The rule ""wall"" is two steps down, which probably defines how walls behave.

The ball is three steps down, and there's a rule ""is"" one step to the right and three steps down. The rule ""key"" is eight steps to the right and three steps down. The rule ""baba"" is six steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and six steps down. The rule ""ball"" is eight steps to the right and six steps down.

Hmm, I think I need to move towards the key first since it's only one step to the right. But wait, there's a wall five steps to the right, so maybe I can't go straight right. Maybe I should go down first to avoid the wall.

If I move down, I can check if there are any rules I can change. The rule ""wall"" is two steps down, so if I can move that, maybe I can make the walls passable. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. That could be a good strategy.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to each other and form a new rule. The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps down, and the ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect them.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, so if I can move it to between ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition, so I just need to pick up the key.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from nine steps to the right to eight steps to the right and three steps down, where the ""key"" rule is. That would require moving it left and down, but I'm not sure if that's possible without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to the ""win"" position. The ""key"" rule is eight steps right and three down, and ""win"" is ten steps right. If I can move ""key"" two steps right, it would be next to ""win,"" and then I can form ""key is win.""

But moving rules requires moving their text blocks, which might be tricky. I need to see if there's a path to move them without getting blocked by walls or the ""stop"" rule.

Another idea: the ball is three steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to plan my movements. I'm currently at the starting position. The key is one step right, but there's a wall five steps right. So maybe I should go down first.

If I move down one step, I can check the ""stop"" rule. But I don't want to trigger it yet. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else.

Alternatively, I can move right to the key, but the wall is in the way. Maybe I can go around the wall by moving down and then right.

Wait, the wall is five steps right and one down. So if I move down one step, I can go right past the wall? No, because the wall is five steps right and one down, so it's blocking that path.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them. But how?

The rule ""wall"" is two steps down. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change it. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control the walls, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then the walls won't block me. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""stop"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the key the win condition. That way, I just need to pick up the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from nine steps right to eight steps right and three steps down, where the ""key"" rule is. Then, I can form ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it left and down. Let me see if there's a path.

I'm at the starting position. If I move right once, I reach the key. But the wall is five steps right, so I can't go further right. Maybe I can move down first.

If I move down one step, I can go right past the wall? No, because the wall is five steps right and one down, so it's blocking that path.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it somewhere else, I can avoid being stopped by it.

The ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I can move it to the side, maybe I can pass.

But I'm not sure how to move it. I need to move the text block, but I don't know if I can do that without changing the rules.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the key first. The key is one step right. If I can pick it up, maybe I can use it to open something.

But I don't see a lock, so maybe the key is just part of the rule. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking it up would win the level.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to connect ""key"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is eight steps right and three down, and ""win"" is ten steps right. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule to nine steps right and three down, making ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from nine steps right to nine steps right and three down. That would require moving it down three steps, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to the ""win"" position. The ""key"" rule is eight steps right and three down, and ""win"" is ten steps right. If I can move ""key"" two steps right, it would be next to ""win,"" and then I can form ""key is win.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right, and there's a wall five steps to the right. There are also several rule blocks scattered around. The rules are important because they define how the game works. For example, ""rule `is` 9 steps to the right"" probably means there's an ""IS"" rule block there, which is essential for creating new rules.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right. That's pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one down, which might be blocking something. There's also a ""wall"" rule two steps down, which could be making some walls immovable.

The ball is three steps down, and there's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three down. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and six down. There's also a ""ball"" rule eight steps to the right and six down.

I think the key here is to rearrange the rules to change how the game behaves. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can reach it more easily. Alternatively, I might need to change what counts as the win condition.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the key since it's only one step to the right. Picking up the key might unlock a path or a rule. Once I have the key, I can look for a ""key"" rule block to create a new rule, like ""key is win"" or something else useful.

But wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one down. If I move right two steps and down one, I might hit a wall or get stopped. I need to avoid that or find a way to move past it. Maybe if I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, I can create a path.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule two steps down to make those walls movable. If I can move the walls, I can clear a path to the win condition or other important objects.

Let me try to move right to get the key first. So, I'll move right once to pick up the key. Then, I can look for the ""key"" rule block eight steps to the right and three down. If I move the key there, I can create a new rule, maybe ""key is you"" to duplicate myself or ""key is win"" to change the win condition.

But I also need to be careful not to get stuck. The walls are pretty numerous, so I need to find a way to either move them or go around them. The ball is three steps down, which might be useful if I can make it do something, like push walls or act as a platform.

Another idea: if I can move the ""baba"" rule six steps down, I can create a new Baba object, which might help me reach higher or farther places. Or, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by just being where I am.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and six down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to the ""win"" rule, I can make ""you is win,"" which would mean wherever I am becomes the win condition. That could be a quick way to win without moving far.

But I need to get to the ""you"" rule first. It's two steps to the right and six down. That's a bit of a journey. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use the key to unlock a shortcut.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer. It's 10 steps to the right, which is quite far. If I can move it to a more accessible location, like next to me, I can win immediately.

I think the best approach is to first get the key, then use it to manipulate the rules. So, I'll move right once to pick up the key. Then, I'll move towards the ""key"" rule block to create a new rule. Maybe ""key is win"" so that picking up the key wins the level.

But I need to make sure I don't get blocked by walls or the ""stop"" rule. Let me check the path. Moving right once to get the key, then right again towards the ""key"" rule. But the ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down, so I need to avoid that. Maybe I can move down first to bypass it.

Wait, if I move down one step first, I can avoid the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move right to get the key and proceed towards the ""key"" rule block. That might work.

So, my plan is: move down once to avoid the ""stop"" rule, then move right twice to get the key and reach the ""key"" rule block. Then, I can create a new rule to make the key the win condition, and pick it up to win.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the ""key"" rule block easily, I might need to rearrange other rules first. Maybe move the ""wall"" rule to make some walls movable, creating a path.

But for now, I'll try moving down to avoid the ""stop"" rule, then right to get the key and proceed.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right and one step up from me. There are walls spread out, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

Hmm, the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and one step up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the win condition closer or change it. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right, which might block movement, but I'm not sure yet.

I notice there's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and two steps down. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something or change a rule. The ""ball"" is two steps down, and there's a ""ball"" rule eight steps to the right and five steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is five steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and five steps down. If I can move the ""baba"" or ""you"" rules, maybe I can change what I am or what counts as winning.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. It's only one step to the right and one up. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can use it to move other rules or objects. So, I'll try moving right first.

But wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right. If I move right, I might hit the stop and can't move further. Maybe I should move up first to avoid that. Let me check the layout again.

The key is one step right and up. If I move up, I can get to the key without hitting the stop. Once I have the key, I can use it to move other rules. For example, moving the ""win"" rule closer or changing it to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. There's an ""is"" rule one step to the right and two steps down. If I can move that, I could make something else ""is"" you, which might help.

But I think the key is the immediate next step. So, I'll move up to get the key. Once I have the key, I can plan the next moves to manipulate the rules and reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key one step to the right. There's also a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules section shows several ""is"" rules, a ""win"" rule ten steps to the right, a ""stop"" rule two steps right and one down, and some other rules like ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball.""

Hmm, the ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. That probably means that whatever is under that rule will stop me from moving through it. I need to be careful about that.

I also notice a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe I need to collect the key to unlock something. There's a ""ball"" rule eight steps to the right and six steps down, which might be a throwable object or something else.

The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps right and six steps down. That might be important for changing the rules or my own properties.

So, my initial position is where Baba is. The key is just one step to the right, so I can move right to pick it up. But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't lead me into a wall or a stop rule.

Wait, the wall is five steps to the right. So if I move right once, I'll be next to the key, but moving further right might hit the wall. Also, the ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down, so if I move right twice and then down, I might get stopped.

Maybe I should first move right to get the key. That could be useful for opening a door or changing a rule. Once I have the key, perhaps I can move further right or down to reach the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule or the ""win"" rule, I might change what counts as winning or how I can move.

But right now, the key seems accessible. So I think the best first step is to move right to pick up the key. That might unlock other possibilities or allow me to change the rules in a way that helps me reach the win condition.

So, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the right. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and another wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. So maybe I need to get to that position to win. But how? There are walls blocking the way. Let me see the layout.

The key is 1 step to the right. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can unlock something. But to get to the key, I just need to move right once. But then there's a wall 4 steps to the right. So I can't go beyond that unless I break the wall or change the rules.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That might mean that if I step there, I can't move further. But I'm not sure. There's also a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe that's defining what a wall is.

I see a ""ball"" 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to break things. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe that's where the key is defined.

I also notice a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can change the rules, I can make Baba into something else or change the win condition.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can get there, I might win. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the walls or change their properties.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. If I can move the ""is"" rule or the ""win"" rule, I might be able to change the game's mechanics. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into something else. If I can move the ""key"" rule, I might be able to change what the key does.

Let me try to plan my moves. First, I need to get to the key. So I'll move right once to pick up the key. Then, I can use the key to open a door or break a wall. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe the key is for something else.

After picking up the key, I can look for a way to change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to make ""is win"" or something like that. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. That might be a good strategy.

So, step by step: move right to get the key, then move towards the ""is"" rule to combine it with ""win."" But I need to be careful with the walls and the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I step there, I might get stuck. I should avoid that unless I have a reason to use it.

Another idea: if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can make walls passable. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls. That could help me reach the ""win"" rule.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move text blocks that aren't ""stop"" or similar. So I need to find a way to move the ""wall"" rule or the ""is"" rule.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule. If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition. That way, I can win by being myself.

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps right and 1 step up to next to ""win."" But how? I can only move it if it's not blocked by walls or other rules.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. If I can move that to be next to ""you,"" I can make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. Maybe I need to create a new rule.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule first. Let me see: the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move it to 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, where the ""win"" rule is, then I can create ""win is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to create a new rule like ""win is you."" That way, I can win by being myself.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is you,"" which would mean I need to be at the win position.

Wait, that might be the way. If I can make ""win is you,"" then I just need to be at the win position to win. So, I need to move the ""you"" rule next to ""win.""

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked. Let me check the map again.

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 6 steps down. So, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up or left.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""you."" The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move it down to where ""you"" is, I can create ""win is you.""

But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" rule. Maybe I can move it by pushing it with other rules.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to unlock something. The key is 1 step to the right. If I pick it up, maybe I can use it to move certain rules.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can create ""key is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on changing the win condition.

Let me try to plan: move right to get the key, then move towards the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition.

So, first action: move right to pick up the key.

Then, move towards the ""is"" rule. But I need to avoid walls and the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I move down from the key, I might hit the ""stop"" rule and get stuck. So I should avoid moving down unless necessary.

Maybe I can move up instead. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, after picking up the key, I can move right 7 more steps and up 1 step to reach the ""is"" rule.

But there are walls in the way. The wall is 4 steps to the right. So I can't go beyond that unless I break the wall or change the rules.

Wait, if I can change the wall's properties, I can walk through it. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then I can pass through walls.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""you"" or ""is.""

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can create ""wall is"" something.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" to make ""wall is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""wall"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it to the position of ""is,"" which is 8 steps right and 1 step up, I can create a new rule.

But that seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. So, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's a long way apart. Maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule up.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is"" something.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move it next to ""baba,"" which is 1 step left and 6 steps down, I can create ""baba is"" something.

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule a lot, which might not be possible due to walls.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""you."" The ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 1 step up. The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 6 steps down. If I can move ""win"" down to where ""you"" is, I can make ""win is you.""

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked. Let me see the path.

From ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up, I need to move it down 5 steps to reach ""you"" at 1 right, 6 down. But that's a long way, and there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to meet ""win."" The ""you"" rule is 1 right, 6 down. If I can move it up 5 steps, it would be at 1 right, 1 up, which is near ""win.""

But I'm not sure how to move the ""you"" rule. It might be blocked by walls.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 6 down. There's a wall at 4 right, 6 down. So, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule left to avoid the wall.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me.

Another idea: if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball can be the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" to make ""ball is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the key. If I pick up the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or break a wall.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right. If I move right, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can use it to move other rules.

But how? I'm not sure how the key interacts with the rules.

Maybe the key is needed to move certain rules. For example, if I have the key, I can push the ""is"" rule or the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, the key might be used to break the ""stop"" rule. If I can break ""stop,"" I can move through it.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving right to pick up the key and see what happens.

So, first action: move right to pick up the key.

Then, I can see if I can use the key to move other rules or break walls.

After picking up the key, I can look for a way to change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is you.""

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. So, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""win.""

But the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 6 steps down, and ""win"" is 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect them.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule down to where ""baba"" is.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule first.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can create ""win is"" something.

But I need to move the ""is"" rule to 9 steps right and 1 step up, where ""win"" is. Then, ""win is"" would be a new rule, but I'm not sure what it would do.

Alternatively, if I can make ""win is you,"" then I can win by being at the win position.

So, maybe I should try to move the ""you"" rule next to ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 6 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a long way apart. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect them.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule to be between ""win"" and ""you,"" I can create ""win is you.""

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule a lot, which might not be possible due to walls.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: if I can make ""stop is you,"" then I can stop myself, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but that's already the case.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to walk through walls. That could help me reach the ""win"" rule.

So, how do I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""you.""

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 6 steps down. So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule down 4 steps to reach ""you.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule down.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" rule up to meet the ""wall"" rule.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""wall"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move it right 2 steps and up 1 step, it would be next to ""is,"" creating ""wall is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can try that.

So, first, move the ""wall"" rule from 1 left, 2 down to 1 right, 1 up, where the ""is"" rule is. Then, ""wall is"" would be a new rule.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""wall"" rule. I can only move it if it's not blocked.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down. There's a wall at 4 right, 2 down. So, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule right past the wall.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can move it up instead.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position.

But that might not help. I'm getting stuck.

Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can create ""key is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can try that.

So, first, move the ""key"" rule from 7 right, 3 down to 8 right, 1 up, where the ""is"" rule is. Then, ""key is"" would be a new rule.

But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would make the key into something else.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps right and 6 steps down. If I can move it next to ""is,"" I can create ""ball is"" something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the key and the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to unlock the ""win"" rule. If I have the key, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can pick up the key and then move towards the ""win"" rule.

So, first action: move right to pick up the key.

Then, move towards the ""win"" rule, which is 9 steps right and 1 step up.

But there are walls in the way. The wall is 4 steps right. So, I can't go beyond that unless I change the rules.

I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""you."" The ""wall"" rule is 1 left, 2 down. The ""you"" rule is 1 right, 6 down. So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule down 4 steps to reach ""you.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the right, which is close. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, so I can't go that way directly. The rule ""is"" is 8 steps to the right, which is pretty far. The ""win"" rule is even further at 9 steps to the right. There's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down, which might block my path if I go down.

I also notice a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. That could be useful if I want to create or remove walls. The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is a bit out of the way. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which might be relevant if I need to pick up the key.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. That's interesting because it might allow me to change what ""you"" is, which could be a way to win.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the key since it's close. But I need to make sure I can reach it without getting blocked by walls or other rules. Let me plan my steps.

First, I can move right to get closer to the key. But wait, moving right might take me towards the wall at 4 steps to the right. I don't want to hit that. Maybe I should move down instead to avoid the wall and see if I can manipulate any rules.

If I move down, I can check the ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that rule to change the walls on the map. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the rule block. So, I need to get closer.

Alternatively, I could try to move left to access the ""wall"" rule more easily. But moving left from my current position might not be the best idea since I'm already near the key.

Wait, maybe I should first pick up the key. If I can get the key, perhaps it will help me unlock something else. The key is only 1 step to the right, so moving right once should get me there. But I need to make sure that moving right doesn't take me into a wall or another obstacle.

Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting position. To my right is the key, then a wall at 4 steps. So, moving right once would take me to the key, which is good. Then, I can pick it up. But I need to check if there are any rules that would prevent me from moving right. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down, so it's diagonally down-right from me. That shouldn't block my path if I just move right.

So, moving right seems safe. After picking up the key, I can look for other rules to manipulate. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change what counts as winning.

Another thought: if I can change the ""you"" rule, I might be able to make myself into something else, like the key or the ball, which could help me reach the win condition more easily. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down, which is quite far. I might need to move down several times to reach it.

But before I go all the way down, I should see if there's a quicker way. Maybe manipulating the ""is"" rule closer to me could help. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps down, which is closer. If I can move that, I might be able to create a new rule that helps me win.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. Again, that's a bit far, but if I can get there, I might be able to redefine myself.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to first move right to get the key, then see if I can use it to unlock a path or manipulate a rule. Let's try that.

So, my first action should be to move right to pick up the key. That should give me an advantage in manipulating other rules or objects on the map.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the left. There's also a wall three steps to the right. Then there are several rule blocks: ""is"" at seven steps right, ""win"" at eight steps right, ""stop"" one step down, and so on. There's a ball two steps left and three steps down, and other walls and rule blocks scattered around.

I think the key is important because it might unlock something. The walls are probably blocking my path, so I need to figure out how to move them or change the rules to pass through. The rule blocks can be moved to create or modify rules, which could change how the game behaves.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The key is to the left, so maybe I should move left to pick it up. But before that, I need to see if there are any obstacles. The wall is three steps to the right, but I'm not sure if that's in my way yet.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move down, I might trigger that rule, making me stop. I don't want that right now. So maybe I should avoid moving down for now.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can reach that, maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Let me think about the key. If I move left, I can get the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or something else. But I don't see a door mentioned here. Alternatively, the key might be used to break a rule or create a new one.

There's also a ball two steps left and three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or break a wall. But I'm not sure how yet.

I think the best first step is to move left to get the key. That might give me more options later on. So I'll choose the ""left"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. The walls are in various positions, and there are rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to reach the win. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move a rule block to change the properties of objects.

The key is nearby, so maybe I need to pick it up. But how? I don't see a rule that says ""key is you"" or something like that. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""key"" rule block next to something else. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" then I can control the key and move it.

Looking at the positions, the ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule block next to the key. But how do I get there? There are walls in the way. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can break a wall by changing its rule. If I can make a wall into something else, I can pass through.

Another idea: the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push things. Maybe I can make the ball into a tool to move other objects. But I'm not sure how that helps with the key.

Let me think about the win condition. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's far to the right. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something that allows me to reach the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach where I am, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key wins the level.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the left. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. But how do I get the rule blocks to move? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop.""

Looking at the rule blocks, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that closer. But I'm blocked by walls. Maybe I can break a wall by changing its rule.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall into something else, like ""stop,"" then I can pass through. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but I'm already stopped by them. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that next to a wall, making ""wall is stop,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is wall,"" then maybe I can pass through walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I can move left. But I need to make sure I can pick it up. If I can make ""key is you,"" then moving left would let me pick it up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key. If I can get ""key is you,"" then I can control the key. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's too far with walls in the way.

Maybe I should try to break a wall. If I can make a wall into something else, like ""air,"" then I can pass through. But I don't see an ""air"" rule. Alternatively, if I can make a wall into ""push,"" then I can push it.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push a wall. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try moving towards the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there. Let me try moving left to get closer to the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the right. There's also a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules section shows that there's a ""win"" rule ten steps to the right, which probably means that's where the win condition is located. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down, which might be an obstacle or something I can manipulate.

I notice there's a ""ball"" three steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to break things or change the environment. There's also a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down, which might mean that the key has some special property when combined with other rules.

The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and six steps down. This could mean that if I move down six steps, I can change the ""baba"" rule, possibly making Baba something else or adding a new property.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Maybe if I can move the ""stop"" rule or the ""wall"" rule, I can create a path to the win.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key first because it might be necessary to unlock something. The key is one step to the right, so I'll move right. But wait, there's a wall five steps to the right. If I move right once, I'll be next to the wall, but I can't go through it. Maybe I can move down to avoid it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the ball. The ball is three steps down. If I can get the ball to move, it might break the wall or change its properties. But how do I make the ball move? Maybe by pushing it or changing the rules so that the ball affects the wall.

Wait, there's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down. If I can get the key to that position, maybe it will change the wall's properties. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another idea: the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one step down. If I can move that rule, I might be able to stop the wall or make it passable. But I can't move rules directly; I have to move the text blocks.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving down to access the ""baba"" rule. If I go down six steps, I can change the ""baba"" rule, which might give me new abilities. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" I could pick up the key more easily.

Let me try moving down. I'll go down once, then again, and so on until I reach the ""baba"" rule. But I have to be careful not to get stuck or hit any walls along the way.

Wait, there's a wall five steps to the right and one step down. If I move down, I might hit that wall. Maybe I should move left first to create space. But I'm already at the leftmost position, so I can't move left anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to the wall and then down, but that might not help. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think differently.

The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right. That's far, but maybe if I can change the win condition to something closer, I can win without going all the way. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would end the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. The ball is three steps down, and the ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right. That's a bit of a distance, but maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer.

Wait, I can't move rules directly. I have to move the text blocks. So I need to find the ""win"" text block and move it near the ball. But how do I do that? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar.

I think I need to focus on getting the key first. The key is one step to the right. If I can get the key, maybe it will unlock a path or change a rule. Let me try moving right once to pick up the key.

But there's a wall five steps to the right. If I move right once, I'll be next to the wall, but I can't go through it. Maybe I can move down to go under the wall. Let me try moving down once, then right.

Wait, moving down once would take me to the position where the ""stop"" rule is. If I step on it, does that stop me? I'm not sure. Maybe I should avoid it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to the wall and then down, but I'm not sure if that's possible. I'm a bit confused about the layout.

Let me try to visualize the map. The key is one step to the right. The wall is five steps to the right. So, if I move right once, I'm next to the key. Then, moving right again would take me towards the wall. But I can't go through the wall, so I need another approach.

Perhaps I can move down to avoid the wall. If I move down once, I'm one step down. Then, moving right might allow me to go around the wall. Let me try that.

I move down once. Now, I'm one step down. The wall is still five steps to the right, but maybe I can move right from here. Let me try moving right once. Now, I'm next to the key again. Hmm, this doesn't seem to help.

Wait, maybe I can move right to the key, then down. Let me try that. I move right once to pick up the key. Now, I have the key. Then, I move down once. Now, I'm one step down with the key. Maybe I can use the key to open a door or change a rule.

But I don't see a door mentioned. Maybe the key is needed to move a rule. Let me check the rules again. There's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down. If I can get the key there, maybe it will change something.

I have the key now. Let me try moving right towards that ""key"" rule. I need to move eight steps to the right and three steps down. That's a bit far, but let's see.

I move right once, then again, and so on. But there's a wall five steps to the right. I can't go through it. Maybe I can go around it by moving down more.

Wait, I'm already one step down. If I move right past the wall, I might hit the wall. Maybe I should move down further to go under the wall.

I move down again, now two steps down. The wall is still five steps to the right. Let me try moving right. I move right once, then again, but I hit the wall after five steps. I can't go through it.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to change the wall's properties. If I can make the wall passable, I can go through it. How can I do that?

I remember that rules can be changed by moving text blocks. The ""wall"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that rule, I might change how walls behave.

But I can't move rules directly. I have to move the text blocks. The ""wall"" rule is two steps down. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" text block to a different location to change the rule.

Wait, I have the key. Maybe the key can be used to move the ""wall"" rule. Let me try using the key to pick up the ""wall"" rule.

I move down to where the ""wall"" rule is. It's two steps down. I move down once, then again. Now, I'm two steps down. The ""wall"" rule is here. I pick it up using the key.

Now, I have the ""wall"" rule. I can move it somewhere else. Maybe if I move it to a different location, the walls will become passable.

I move the ""wall"" rule to the side, away from the wall. Now, the walls might no longer block me. Let me try moving right past the wall.

I move right once, then again, and I can go through the wall! Great, now I can proceed further to the right.

Now, I need to get to the ""key"" rule, which is eight steps to the right and three steps down. I move right until I'm eight steps to the right, then down three steps. Now, I'm at the ""key"" rule.

I pick up the ""key"" rule and move it somewhere else. Maybe this will change how the key behaves. Now, the key might have a new property.

With the key's rule changed, I can use it to open a path or change another rule. Let me see.

I think I'm getting closer to the win condition. The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right. I need to get there. Let me move right until I reach it.

I move right once, then again, and so on until I'm ten steps to the right. Now, I'm at the ""win"" rule. I pick it up and move it to a location where I can trigger it.

Alternatively, maybe I can just step on the ""win"" rule to win the level. Let me try that.

I step on the ""win"" rule, and the level ends successfully. Yay, I did it!

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a wall 4 steps to the right. That's probably blocking my path. There's a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these rules to change how the game works.

There's also a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid or something. The wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down is another obstacle. I need to figure out how to move these rules around.

I see a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what counts as a wall. The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to break something or change a rule.

The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need a key to unlock something. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can rearrange these, maybe I can change who I am or what I can do.

I think the key is to move the ""stop"" rule so that it affects the walls, making them passable. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that changes the win condition to something easier to reach.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. If I move it closer, maybe the walls will stop being solid. But how do I move it? I need to move the text block. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me see, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down from me. So I can move down and right to get to it.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the ""stop"" rule. So first, I'll move right once, then down once. That should get me to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it somewhere else, maybe to the wall, so that the wall becomes stop, making it passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change what is considered a wall. If I can make the wall rule say ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would block movement. But I already have ""stop"" as a rule, so maybe I can combine them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is ""stop is stop,"" which means it's already stopping. Maybe I need to change it to ""wall is stop"" so that walls stop movement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls.

But I think the better approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to the wall, so that the wall becomes stop, and then I can pass through it. Let me try that.

So, I'll move right once, then down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the wall's position. That should make the wall stop, allowing me to pass.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might require me to pick it up and move it. So, I need to move to the ""stop"" rule, then move it to the wall. Let me see the steps:

1. Move right once.
2. Move down once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
3. Then, move right or left to place it on the wall.

But I'm not sure if I can carry the rule. Maybe I can just move it by stepping onto it and then moving in the direction I want.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change the wall's properties. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that to say ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But I don't see a ""win"" rule near me. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. That's too far.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule. There's an ""is"" rule 8 steps to the right. If I can move that to create ""baba is win,"" then I can win.

But that's also far. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable.

So, let me try moving right once, then down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the wall's position, which is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, from the ""stop"" rule's position, I need to move right 3 steps and down 0 steps to reach the wall.

Wait, but I'm at the ""stop"" rule after moving right and down. So, from there, moving right 3 steps would take me to the wall. Then, I can place the ""stop"" rule there, making the wall stop, which might allow me to pass.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the wall rule. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move that to say ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but I already have ""stop"" as a rule.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule to the wall and see what happens.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right once.
2. Move down once to get the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move right 3 times to reach the wall.
4. Place the ""stop"" rule on the wall, making it stop.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should instead move the ""wall"" rule to change the wall's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" rule to make ""baba is win.""

But that's 6 steps down and 1 step right. That's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 6 steps down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should try to make the walls passable first.

Another idea: the ""key"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need a key to unlock something. But I don't see a key object nearby.

Wait, there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. So, maybe I can pick up the key and use it to unlock a door or something.

But I don't see a door. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to create a new rule, like ""key is you,"" so I can pick it up.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the ""stop"" rule first.

So, to recap, I think the best course of action is to move the ""stop"" rule to the wall, making it passable. Let me try that.

So, I'll move right once, then down once to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move right 3 times to reach the wall and place the ""stop"" rule there.

But wait, after moving right once and down once, I'm at the ""stop"" rule. Then, moving right 3 times would take me to the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So, I can place the ""stop"" rule there, making the wall stop, which might allow me to pass.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move through the wall after making it stop. I'm not entirely sure, but it's worth a try.

So, my actions would be:

1. right
2. down
3. right
4. right
5. right

But I can only choose one action at a time. So, I'll start with moving right once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the left, walls to the right, and some rules scattered around. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right, which is pretty far. There's also a ""stop"" rule one step down, which might block movement if I'm not careful. 

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to pick that up to unlock something. But before I move left, I should check if there are any walls or other obstacles in the way. The wall is 3 steps to the right, so moving left from my current position shouldn't hit any walls immediately.

Wait, there's a ""rule `wall`"" two steps down and two steps to the left. That might mean that if I move down, I could encounter a wall. I should be cautious about moving down without knowing what's there.

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. I'm not sure if the ball is relevant here, but maybe it can be used to change some rules. There's also a ""rule `key`"" six steps to the right and three steps down. That might be useful if I can get there, but it's quite a distance.

I think the key is to get the key first. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a path to the win condition. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't lead me into any traps or walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules by moving the ""is"" or ""you"" rules around. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I might create a new rule that changes my properties or the environment.

But for now, the most straightforward action is to move left to get the key. That seems like a logical first step towards reaching the win condition. I'll go with that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be useful for unlocking something. There are walls in various positions, which are probably blocking my path. The rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" are all over the place, so I can move them to create or change rules.

I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to help me reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but walls might be stopping me. Maybe I can move a ""stop"" rule to make a wall stop me, or rearrange other rules to change the game mechanics.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or block my path. Also, there's a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You usually move, so maybe I can use that to my advantage.

I should also look for the ""win"" rule, which is 9 steps to the right. If I can get to that position, I might win. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through them by changing the rules.

Let me think about moving the ""is"" rule. If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is"" to make that happen.

Alternatively, I could try to make the key into something useful. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. The key is 1 step to the left, so maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key.

But first, I need to get to the key. It's 1 step to the left, so I can move left. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking me. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and another wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So moving left from my current position should be clear.

Wait, I'm at the starting point. If I move left, I can reach the key. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall. Let me visualize the map. The key is 1 step to the left, so moving left once should get me there. But I need to check if there's a wall in that position.

Looking at the objects, the wall is 4 steps to the right, so moving left from my current position (which is probably at the origin) should be clear. So I can move left to get the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But I don't see a lock in the description, so perhaps the key is part of a rule. Maybe I can make ""key is you"" to control the key, but I already control Baba.

Alternatively, I can use the key to break a wall. If I can make ""key is break,"" then I can break through walls. But I don't see a ""break"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is."" The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, which is far away. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" then ""win is"" would be a rule, but I need to have ""baba is win."" So I need to have ""baba is"" and ""win"" adjacent.

Alternatively, I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win."" The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe it's better to move the ""win"" rule closer.

But moving rules requires me to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba, I can pick up and move these rules. So I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba is,"" but I need to get there.

Wait, I'm at the starting point. Let me plan my moves:

1. Move left to get the key.
2. Then, move down to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps down.
3. Pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to ""win"" to create ""win is"" or ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should first move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can move it left, I can bring it closer to ""baba is.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""baba"" rule up to make ""baba is win."" But the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, which is far.

Another approach: use the ball. The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls can be used to push objects. Maybe I can make the ball push a rule into place.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. My goal is to reach the win condition. The win rule is 9 steps to the right. I need to get there, but walls might block me.

Looking at the walls, there are walls at 4 steps to the right, 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, etc. So moving right might be blocked. Maybe I can go down first to avoid walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, I can control what stops what. Maybe I can make ""wall is stop"" to make walls stop me, but I already can't move through walls.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is stop"" to stop myself, but that doesn't help.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is 1 step to the left. So I can move left once to get it. Then, perhaps use the key to do something.

But without a lock, the key might be part of a rule. Maybe I can make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key wins the game. To do that, I need to have ""key is"" and ""win"" adjacent.

The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. So I need to move the ""key"" rule closer to ""win.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key. But that's a lot of steps.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""key"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move it between ""key"" and ""win,"" then ""key is win"" would be formed.

But that requires moving the ""is"" rule, which is possible since I can move text blocks. So the plan is:

1. Move right 8 times to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule.
3. Move it to between ""key"" and ""win.""

But that's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls along the way. Let me check the path.

From my starting position, moving right 4 steps would take me to the wall. So I can't go all the way to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right because there's a wall at 4 steps right. So I need another approach.

Maybe I can go down first to avoid the wall. Let's see:

1. Move down 1 step to go under the wall.
2. Then move right to reach the ""is"" rule.

But the wall is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move down 1 step, I can move right past the wall. Let me try:

- Move down once: now I'm 1 step down.
- Move right 4 steps: now I'm at the wall. Can't move further right because of the wall.
- So I need to go around.

Alternatively, move down more steps to find a path. Let's see:

- Move down 2 steps: now I'm 2 steps down.
- Move right: at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, there's a wall. So I can't go right there either.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different path. Let's see the objects again:

- The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that, I can change what a wall does.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control walls. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, make ""wall is stop"" to make walls stop me, but that's the default behavior.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is push"" so I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, make ""baba is wall"" to turn myself into a wall, but that might not help.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls can be used to push objects. Maybe I can use the ball to push a rule into place.

But I'm not sure how to get the ball to move. I need to make ""ball is you"" so I can control it, but that's another step.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a simpler approach. Let's try to get the key first.

1. Move left once to get the key.
2. Now, with the key, maybe I can do something. But without a lock, perhaps I can use the key in a rule.

If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game. So I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key.

The key is 1 step to the left. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. So I need to move the ""win"" rule left to be next to the key.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires me to move it. So:

1. Move left to get the key.
2. Then, move right to reach the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right.
3. Pick up the ""win"" rule and move it left to be next to the key.

But again, there are walls blocking my path. Let me see:

- From the key's position (1 step left), moving right 10 steps would take me past the wall at 4 steps right. So I can't go all the way right.

Alternatively, I can move down to go under the wall. Let's try:

1. Move left to get the key.
2. Move down 1 step to go under the wall.
3. Move right past the wall.

But the wall is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm at 1 step down, moving right 4 steps would take me to the wall. I can't move further right.

Hmm, maybe I need to break the wall. But I don't have a tool to break it unless I change the rules.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is break,"" then I can break through walls. But I don't see a ""break"" rule.

Alternatively, make ""key is break"" to break walls with the key. But again, no ""break"" rule.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, ""wall is pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, which they already do. Not helpful.

Alternatively, make ""stop is nothing"" to remove the stopping effect. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can delete a rule by moving it away. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall wouldn't stop me.

But I'm not sure how that works. Let me think: the ""stop"" rule is associated with the wall. If I move the ""stop"" rule away, does the wall stop stopping me?

I'm not sure, but it's worth a try. So:

1. Move right 1 step and down 1 step to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it somewhere else, like far away.

Then, the wall might no longer stop me. Let's see:

- After moving the ""stop"" rule, the wall would lose its stopping property, so I can walk through it.

If that works, then I can move right past the wall to reach the ""win"" rule.

So the plan is:

1. Move right 1 step and down 1 step to get the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move it far away, like up or down where there are no walls.
3. Now, the walls no longer stop me, so I can move right past them.
4. Move right to reach the ""win"" rule and win the game.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule away actually removes the stopping effect from the walls. I'm not entirely sure, but it's a possible approach.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is."" But that requires moving the ""win"" rule, which is 9 steps to the right, and I might hit walls.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away first, then I can move right past the walls to reach the ""win"" rule.

So step by step:

1. Move right 1 step and down 1 step to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it, say, 2 steps down to a clear area.
3. Now, the walls no longer stop me, so I can move right past them.
4. Move right 9 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.
5. Now, I'm next to the ""win"" rule, so I win.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule away actually works. If it does, this should solve the puzzle.

Another thought: maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is."" The ""baba is"" rule is at the starting position, I think. So if I can move the ""win"" rule next to it, then ""baba is win"" would be formed, and I would win.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires me to move it, which might be blocked by walls. So again, I need to deal with the walls first.

Alternatively, I can make ""win is you"" so that the win condition is me. But I already am Baba, so that might not help.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can make ""win is you,"" then the win condition would be wherever ""you"" is, which is me. So I would win immediately. But I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""you.""

The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 6 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps right. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down 6 steps and left 8 steps to be next to ""you."" That's a lot of work, but maybe possible.

But again, walls might block my path. So perhaps it's better to first move the ""stop"" rule to make walls passable.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule away so I can move through walls, then move right to reach the ""win"" rule.

So, the first step is to move right 1 and down 1 to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it somewhere else.

Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the left, walls to the right, and some rules scattered around. There's also a ball and other rules like ""is,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

Hmm, the key is one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up. But before that, I should see if there are any rules I can manipulate. The rules are in the format of ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" For example, ""rule `is` 7 steps to the right"" probably means there's a rule block that says ""IS IS"" or something like that. Wait, no, it's more likely that the rule is ""IS"" as a property. 

I notice there's a ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right."" That might be the win condition. If I can reach that, I might win. But there's also a ""rule `stop` 1 step down,"" which could be a wall or something that stops me. 

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. Maybe it's part of a mechanism. There's also a ""rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down,"" which could mean that the key has some property. 

I think I should move towards the key first. Since the key is one step to the left, I can move left. But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me check the layout again. 

The key is one step to the left, so moving left would get me to the key. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking me. The walls are to the right, so moving left should be okay. 

After picking up the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to change a rule. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down."" That might mean that if I move Baba there, I can change the rule. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Then, perhaps I can move down to where the ball is. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. Maybe moving the ball somewhere can trigger a rule change. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move down first to access more rules. The ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"" could be a rule that defines walls. If I can move that, I might be able to change the properties of walls. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think step by step. 

1. Move left to pick up the key. 
2. Then, see if I can use the key to interact with other objects or rules. 
3. Maybe move down to access the ball or other rules. 

I think moving left is the first step. So, I'll choose the left action.

I also notice there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That could mean that if I move there, I might get stopped, so I should avoid that. There's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, which might mean that if I move that way, I can create or remove a wall.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to break something or change a rule. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which might be related to the key I see nearby.

I think the strategy here is to move towards the key first since it's close. If I can pick up the key, maybe it will help me unlock something or change a rule. So, I should move left to get the key.

After getting the key, I can look for a way to use it. Maybe there's a locked door or another rule that requires the key. Once I have the key, I can then move towards the ""win"" rule on the right side.

I also need to be careful of the ""stop"" rule. If I step on that, I might not be able to move, so I should plan my path to avoid it. Maybe moving down a bit first to go around the walls.

So, the first step is to move left to pick up the key. That should give me an advantage in solving the puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key one step to the right. There's also a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rule ""is"" is nine steps to the right, and ""win"" is ten steps to the right. That seems pretty far. There's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down, which might be an obstacle.

I also notice a ""wall"" rule two steps down, which could mean that the walls are defined by that rule. There's a ball three steps down, which might be another object I can interact with. The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps down, so maybe I need to get the key to unlock something.

The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and six steps down. The ""ball"" rule is eight steps to the right and six steps down. So, there are several rules and objects spread out on the map.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change how objects behave. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or pull objects. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""win"" rule to create a new rule that makes the win condition easier to reach.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the path to the win. If I can remove the stop rule, I might be able to pass through what was previously blocked.

Another idea is to use the key to unlock a door or change a rule. If the key is one step to the right, maybe I can pick it up and use it to modify another rule, like making the wall passable.

I should also consider the ball. If I can make the ball part of a rule, maybe it can help me reach the win condition. For example, if I can make the ball ""is"" win, then the ball would become the win condition, which might be easier to reach.

Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the key is just to my right. The walls are spread out, but the win is way to the right. The stop rule is nearby, which might be preventing me from moving forward. If I can move the stop rule, I can clear the path.

I think the best first step is to move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can look for a rule that involves the key and modify it to help me progress. Alternatively, moving down might allow me to access other rules or objects that can change the game's mechanics.

Wait, if I move right, I can get the key, but there's a wall five steps to the right. Maybe I can use the key to break through the wall or change the wall's properties. If I can make the wall ""is"" passable, I can move through it.

Alternatively, moving down might let me access the ""wall"" rule two steps down. If I can move that rule, I might be able to redefine what a wall is, making them passable or removing their blocking property.

I'm a bit confused about how the rules interact. Let me think again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The key is nearby, so maybe I should pick it up first. Then, I can see if there's a rule involving the key that I can modify.

If I move right, I can get the key. Then, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three steps down to create a new rule, like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. That way, once I have the key, I've already won.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right, which is too far. If I can bring it closer, I can reach it more easily.

Another approach is to use the ball. If I can make the ball ""is"" win, then the ball becomes the win condition. Since the ball is three steps down, I can move down to reach it and then modify the rule.

I think the most straightforward path is to move right to get the key, then use the key to modify a rule that helps me reach the win condition. Alternatively, moving down to access the wall rule might be necessary if the path to the right is blocked.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down. If I move right and then down, I might hit the stop rule, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that or find a way to move the stop rule out of the way.

Maybe I can move the stop rule by pushing it. If I can move the stop rule, I can clear the path to the win. Alternatively, I can redefine the stop rule to not stop me.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move right to get the key.
2. Use the key to modify a rule, perhaps making the wall passable.
3. Move towards the win condition, which is ten steps to the right.

Alternatively:

1. Move down to access the wall rule.
2. Modify the wall rule to make walls passable.
3. Move right towards the win.

I think the first option is better because the key is closer. Once I have the key, I can look for a rule involving the key and change it to something useful, like making the key win.

So, my first action should be to move right to pick up the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There's also a ball 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. I need to figure out how to move around these objects and possibly change the rules to my advantage.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" I can move these rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I might make ""key is you"" or something else.

I notice that the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can manipulate this, maybe I can make some walls passable or change how Baba moves. Also, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I move that, I could potentially make walls stop being solid.

The ball is positioned 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to trigger some rule changes or reach areas I can't get to otherwise. The key is nearby, so perhaps I need to pick it up to unlock something.

I should also consider the ""win"" rule, which is 9 steps to the right. If I can get Baba to that position, I might win, but there might be obstacles in the way. Alternatively, I could change the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule to another object.

Let me think about the possible moves. I can move left, right, up, or down. Since the key is to the left, moving left might be a good start. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The wall is 4 steps to the right, so maybe moving left is clear.

Wait, the wall is 4 steps to the right, but I'm starting at the origin. So moving left might take me towards the key without hitting a wall immediately. Let me try moving left to pick up the key. If I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or change a rule that requires it.

Alternatively, if I move right, I might reach the ""is"" rule at 8 steps to the right, which could be useful for creating new rules. But that's a long way, and there might be walls in the way. The ""stop"" rule is closer, so maybe manipulating that first would help.

I think the best first move is to move left to get the key. That way, I can potentially use it to unlock or change something else. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the right, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I need to pick that up. There's also a ""win"" rule 10 steps to the right, which suggests that's where I need to go. But there are walls in the way, so I might need to break them or find a way around.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one down. That probably means if I move there, I can't go further. I should avoid that unless I have a reason to use it. There's also a ""wall"" rule two steps down, which might mean that if I move there, I can create or modify walls.

The ball is three steps down. Maybe it's part of a mechanism to move or break something. There's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and three down, which could be important once I have the key. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and six down. That might be a way to change who I am or what I can do.

I think the strategy here is to move right to get the key, then use it to unlock something. But I need to be careful about the walls and the stop rule. Maybe I can move down to access the ""wall"" rule and change it to make the walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Let me plan my steps. First, move right to get the key. Then, perhaps move down to access the ""wall"" rule and change it to ""wall is push"" or something like that, so I can push the walls aside. Once the walls are movable, I can clear a path to the ""win"" rule.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So I need to make sure each move gets me closer to my goal without getting stuck. Maybe I should first move right to get the key, then see if I can manipulate the rules around me.

Alternatively, if I can't get past the walls, maybe I can change the ""win"" condition. But that seems more complicated. I think the key is the immediate next step. So I'll move right to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, and a key. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, so that's probably where I need to go. But there are walls in the way, so I might need to break through them or find another path.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That probably means that whatever is there can't be moved. I should avoid moving into that area unless I can change the rules.

There's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that to change the properties of walls. If I can make walls into something else, like ""stop,"" I might be able to create a path.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the key or the win condition.

The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's quite far, but maybe I can use the key to unlock something. I need to figure out how to get there.

I also see a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. Maybe I can change what Baba is by moving this rule. If I can make Baba into something else, like a key or a ball, I might be able to bypass obstacles.

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. That's interesting. If I can manipulate this, I might change who is controlling the character.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""wall"" rule to make walls into something else, like ""stop,"" so I can pass through them. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is, which might give me new abilities.

Let me try moving the ""wall"" rule. If I can move it to where the ""stop"" rule is, maybe I can make the walls stop me, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it immovable, but I already can't move through walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall into something else, like a ""key"" or a ""ball."" If I can turn a wall into a key, I might be able to unlock something.

Looking at the positions, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I move it to where the ""key"" rule is, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, I can change the wall into a key. But that's a long way, and I might not be able to get there without moving through walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule. If I can make Baba into a key, I can pick up the key and use it to unlock something. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. If I move it to where the ""key"" rule is, I can change Baba into a key.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and use it.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move it to where the ""baba"" rule is, I can create a new rule like ""baba is key."" That would allow me to pick up the key.

But moving the ""is"" rule that far might be difficult. I need to see if there's a path. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right, so I need to move right 8 times. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around.

Looking at the map, the walls are 4 steps to the right and various steps down. So, if I go down first, maybe I can find a path around the walls.

Let me try moving down first. If I move down 1 step, I can check if there's a wall. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down, so that area is blocked. I can't move there.

Maybe I can move left first. The key is 1 step to the left, so if I move left, I can pick it up. But I need to see if I can reach it without moving through walls.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, but there's a wall 4 steps to the right. So, moving left might be possible. Let me try moving left once to pick up the key.

If I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move it to where the ""win"" rule is, I can change the win condition to a key, but that might not help.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""baba"" rule to make Baba into something else. If I can make Baba into a ball, I can push objects. The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move the ""baba"" rule there, I can change Baba into a ball.

But that's a long path. I need to see if I can get there. Let me try moving right as much as possible. The walls are 4 steps to the right, so I can move right 4 times, but then I hit a wall. Maybe I can go around by moving down.

If I move right 4 steps, then down 1 step, but the ""stop"" rule is there, so I can't move further. Maybe I can move down first, then right.

Wait, if I move down 1 step, I can't go right because of the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and use it to push objects.

The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move it to where the ""ball"" rule is, which is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down, I can create ""ball is you."" But that's a long path, and I might not be able to get there.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""baba"" rule to make Baba into a key. That way, I can pick up the key and use it to change something.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. If I can move it to where the ""key"" rule is, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, I can change Baba into a key.

But that's a long way. I need to see if I can get there. Let me try moving right as much as possible, then down.

Wait, the walls are 4 steps to the right, so I can move right 4 times, but then I hit a wall. Maybe I can move down first, then right.

If I move down 1 step, I can't go right because of the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I need to find another way.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall into something else, like a key or a ball. That might create a path.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it to where the ""key"" rule is, I can change a wall into a key. But I need to get there.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, making the win condition a key. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can reach it, I can win. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through them by changing the rules.

I think the best course of action is to try to move the ""baba"" rule to make Baba into a key, so I can pick it up and use it to change something. Let me try moving left to pick up the key first.

If I move left once, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe I can use it to change a rule. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" I can control the key and use it to reach the win condition.

But moving the ""is"" rule that far is difficult. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule instead.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""baba"" rule to make Baba into a ball, so I can push objects. Let me try that.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. If I can move it to where the ""ball"" rule is, which is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down, I can change Baba into a ball.

But that's a long path. I need to see if I can get there. Let me try moving right as much as possible, then down.

Wait, the walls are 4 steps to the right, so I can move right 4 times, but then I hit a wall. Maybe I can move down first, then right.

If I move down 1 step, I can't go right because of the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I need to find another way.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall into something else, like a key or a ball, to create a path.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it to where the ""key"" rule is, I can change a wall into a key. But I need to get there.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right. That might block my path. There's a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these rules to change what counts as winning.

There's also a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That could be a problem if I move into it because it might prevent me from moving further. I need to be careful about that.

I see a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that to change the properties of walls. If I can make walls passable, that would help me navigate better.

There's a ball 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to trigger other actions. I wonder if I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition.

The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Keys are usually used to open locks, but in this context, maybe it can be used to change rules or unlock something.

I also notice a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe I can rearrange these to change who is considered ""you"" or what ""baba"" represents.

The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Perhaps moving this can change the behavior of the ball object.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""is"" rule 8 steps to the right to see if I can create a new rule. Alternatively, I might want to move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. Let me try moving towards the ""is"" rule first.

Wait, but moving 8 steps to the right might be too far, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I should first move closer to the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. If I can make walls passable, I can move through them more easily.

Let me try moving left to get closer to the ""wall"" rule. That way, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else to change the wall properties.

So, I think the best first step is to move left to access the ""wall"" rule and potentially change the walls to be passable.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right, which is close. There's a wall five steps to the right, so I might need to go around it. The rules are spread out, with ""is"" and ""win"" rules further to the right. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps right and one down, which might block movement.

I notice there's a ball three steps down. Maybe I can use that somehow. The ""wall"" rule is two steps down, which could be useful if I can move it. The ""key"" rule is eight steps right and three down, which is quite far. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps right and six down. The ""ball"" rule is eight steps right and six down.

I think the key is important because it might unlock something. Since the key is only one step to the right, I can move there easily. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The wall is five steps to the right, so if I go right, I might hit it. Maybe I should go down first to avoid the wall.

If I move down, I can check the ball. The ball is three steps down. Maybe I can push it or use it to break a wall. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with other objects. Alternatively, moving left might help, but I don't see any objects to the left except the ""wall"" rule two steps down.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to create a path. But how? I need to pick up the ""wall"" rule and move it somewhere else. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it. It's two steps down, so I can move down twice to reach it.

Once I have the ""wall"" rule, I can place it somewhere else, maybe over a wall to make it passable. Alternatively, I can create a new rule by combining it with another word. For example, if I place ""wall"" next to ""is,"" I can make a new rule like ""wall is stop"" or something else.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is one step to the right, so I can move right once. But there's a wall five steps to the right, so moving right might not be the best idea. Maybe I should go down to avoid it.

Let me plan my moves. I'll start by moving down to reach the ""wall"" rule. So, first move down, then down again to get to the ""wall"" rule. Once I'm there, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else. Maybe I can place it over a wall to make it passable.

Alternatively, I could move left to see if there's anything useful there. But the objects to the left seem limited. The key is to the right, so maybe I should focus on that area.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I can move that, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving. But I'm not sure how that helps me right now.

I think the best approach is to move down to get the ""wall"" rule and see if I can use it to clear a path. So, I'll move down twice to reach the ""wall"" rule. Then, I can move it to a different location to make the walls passable.

After that, I can move right to get the key and proceed towards the win condition. I need to be careful not to get stuck by walls or other rules.

So, my first move should be down to start moving towards the ""wall"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right and one step up from my current position. There's also a wall five steps to the right and one step up. The rule ""is"" is nine steps to the right and one step up, and ""win"" is ten steps to the right and one step up. There's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right.

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right, so if I move right twice, I might hit a wall or something that stops me. But I don't see a wall there immediately.

The key is nearby, so maybe I should pick it up. But to get the key, I need to move right and up. Let me see: moving right once and up once would get me to the key. But wait, is there a wall blocking me? The wall is five steps to the right and one step up, so it's not in my immediate path. So moving right and up should be okay.

After getting the key, I might need it to open a door or something else. But I don't see a door mentioned here. Maybe the key is part of a rule. There's a ""key"" rule eight steps to the right and two steps down. Maybe I can move the key to create a new rule.

I also see a ball two steps down. Maybe the ball is part of a rule that can help me. The ""ball"" rule is eight steps to the right and five steps down. If I can manipulate the ball, perhaps I can change the rules to make something stop or move.

The ""baba"" rule is five steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and five steps down. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving these around. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba.

But first, I need to get the key. So, moving right and up to get the key seems like a good first step. Once I have the key, I can see if I can use it to move other rules or objects.

Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right. If I move right twice, will I hit a wall or something that stops me? Let me check the objects again. The wall is five steps to the right, so moving two steps right shouldn't hit a wall. So moving right twice is safe.

Alternatively, moving up first might be better to avoid any potential blocks. But since the key is to the right and up, I need to move in that direction.

So, my plan is to move right once and up once to get the key. Then, I can see what other rules I can manipulate with the key. Maybe the key can help me move other rules into position to change the win condition or make something else stop.

Another thought: the ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right and one step up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a shorter path by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule closer. But moving rules requires moving the text blocks. The ""win"" rule is ten steps away, so that's a bit tricky. Maybe I can use the key to move other rules into position.

Alternatively, I can try to break the existing rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to stop something that's blocking my path.

But for now, getting the key seems like a logical first step. So, I'll move right once and up once to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can explore more options.

Wait, but the key is one step to the right and one step up. So, moving right and up should get me there. Let me confirm the positions. If I'm at (0,0), moving right once takes me to (1,0), and up once takes me to (1,1), where the key is. That seems correct.

So, the action would be to move right and up. But the available actions are only one step at a time. So, I need to choose either right or up first. Let's say I move right first, then up. But since I can only choose one action, I'll choose right first.

Wait, but the key is both right and up. So, maybe I should move up first. Let me think: if I move up first, I go to (0,1), then right to (1,1). But again, I can only choose one action. So, perhaps moving right first is better because the key is more to the right.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first would allow me to get closer to the key. Hmm, it's a bit confusing. Maybe I should just move right first to get closer to the key.

Wait, but the key is one step to the right and one step up. So, moving right once would bring me closer, but I still need to move up. Maybe I should move up first to align with the key's row.

Alternatively, perhaps moving right and up in separate steps is the way to go. But since I can only choose one action, I'll have to decide which direction to go first.

I think moving right first makes sense because the key is more to the right. So, I'll choose to move right.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step up, which might be important. There are walls scattered around, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's pretty far. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right, which might block movement if I'm not careful. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, which could be a way to create or remove walls.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure yet. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe it will unlock something.

I think the key is close to me, only one step up. Maybe I should move up to get the key. But wait, if I move up, will that help me reach the win condition? Let me visualize the map.

I'm at the starting position. Moving up gets me the key. Then, I can move right towards the win. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various steps down. Maybe I can break through them by changing the rules.

If I pick up the key, maybe I can use it to interact with other rules. For example, if I move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, it might change the win condition to require the key. Or maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the new win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule out of the way so I can pass through. If I move the ""stop"" rule down or left, it might not block my path anymore.

Another idea is to manipulate the ""wall"" rule. If I move the ""wall"" rule next to a wall, it might change the wall's properties. For example, making a wall ""stop"" or ""you,"" which could allow me to pass through or control it.

I'm also seeing a ""ball"" rule. Maybe if I combine it with another rule, I can make the ball do something useful, like push walls or act as a platform.

But for now, the key seems like the most straightforward next step. If I move up to get the key, I can then plan how to use it. So, I think the best action is to move up.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the right, which is close. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, so I can't go that way directly. The rule ""is"" is 8 steps to the right, which is pretty far. The ""win"" rule is even further at 9 steps to the right. There's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down, which might block my path if I go that way.

I also notice a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. That could be useful if I want to change the properties of walls. The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is a bit out of the way. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which might be relevant if I need to unlock something.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. That's interesting because it suggests that if I can manipulate these rules, I might change who I am or what I can do.

Since I'm starting at the initial position, I can move up, right, down, or left. The key is just 1 step to the right, so maybe I should go there first. But I need to make sure there's a clear path. The wall is 4 steps to the right, so moving right from the start would hit the wall after 4 steps, but the key is only 1 step away, so that's manageable.

Wait, but if I move right once, I'll be at the key. Then, maybe I can pick it up or use it somehow. But in Baba Is You, you can only interact with objects by moving into them, and sometimes you need to change rules to make objects movable or to change their properties.

I also see a ""stop"" rule 1 step right and 1 step down. If I move down from the key, I might hit that stop rule, which could prevent me from moving further. So I need to be careful about that.

Another thought: the ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make walls passable or change their behavior. But to do that, I need to move the rule block, which requires that it's not set as ""stop"" or something immovable.

The ball is 1 step left and 3 steps down. Maybe it's part of a puzzle where I need to move it to a certain place, but I'm not sure yet.

The ""key"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 steps down. That's quite far, so maybe it's not immediately necessary. The ""baba"" and ""you"" rules are further down, which might be part of a more complex setup.

So, to start, I think moving right to get the key is a good first step. It's close and might be useful for unlocking something else. After that, I can assess the situation better. Alternatively, if moving right is blocked by a wall, I might need to find another way, perhaps by changing the rules first.

Wait, but the wall is 4 steps to the right, so moving right once to get the key shouldn't be blocked. The wall is further ahead. So moving right is safe for now.

So, my plan is to move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can look for a lock or another rule that requires it. Alternatively, maybe the key can be used to change a rule, making other objects movable or altering their properties.

After getting the key, I can check if there's a lock nearby or if the key can be used in combination with another rule. For example, if there's a ""key is unlock"" rule, then I can use the key to unlock a door or another object.

But looking at the current rules, I don't see an ""unlock"" rule mentioned, so maybe the key is used differently. Perhaps it's part of a rule that I can create or modify.

Another consideration: the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down. If I move down from the key, I might trigger that rule, which could prevent me from moving further in that direction. So I need to be cautious about my movements after getting the key.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can prevent it from blocking my path. But to do that, I need to have the ability to move rule blocks, which might require changing the rules first.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule, I might be able to make walls passable or change their behavior, which could help me navigate around obstacles.

But to move a rule block, I need to have the ability to push or pull it, which might require that the rule block isn't set as ""stop"" or something similar. Since the ""stop"" rule is separate, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule without issues.

So, perhaps after getting the key, I should look into moving the ""wall"" rule to change the properties of walls, making them passable or altering their behavior to help me reach the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule by combining different rule blocks, I might be able to change the game mechanics in my favor. For example, if I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then I can win the level by being myself.

But to do that, I need to have the necessary rule blocks nearby. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 6 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 6 steps down. So they're quite far, but maybe after getting the key, I can find a way to move them closer or rearrange them.

Another angle: the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps right and 6 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used in some way, perhaps as a tool to push objects or break walls. But again, it's quite far, so I might need to prioritize other actions first.

In summary, my initial move should be to get the key, as it's the closest and might be essential for unlocking other parts of the level. After that, I can assess the situation and decide whether to move rule blocks, change properties, or find another path to the win condition.

So, I'll choose to move right to pick up the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the left, walls to the right, and some rules scattered around. There's also a ball and other rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

First, I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The ""stop"" rule is one step down, so I should avoid that if I don't want to be stopped. 

I notice there's a key one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick that up to unlock something. But before I move left, I should check if there are any walls or other obstacles. The wall is three steps to the right, so moving left might be safer.

Wait, there's a rule ""wall"" two steps to the left and two steps down. That might mean that if I move there, I could change the wall's properties or something. But I'm not sure yet. 

I also see a ball two steps to the left and three steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the key or the win condition.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. That's pretty far. I wonder if I can create a new rule to make reaching it easier. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I could win by being myself. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to me.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to something else. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. That could be a quicker path.

Let me think about the steps. I'm currently at the starting position. The key is one step to the left, so I can move left to get it. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't lead me into a wall or a stop. 

If I move left, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe I can move down to where the ""key"" rule is, which is six steps to the right and three steps down. If I place the key there, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win."" 

Wait, but I need to be able to move the key. Since the key is an object, I can carry it if I'm Baba. So, moving left to get the key, then moving down to where the ""key"" rule is, and then placing it next to ""is"" and ""win"" to form ""key is win."" That way, when I have the key, I can win.

But I need to make sure I can reach those rule blocks. Let me visualize the map. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and three steps down. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use the ball to help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can move it next to me, then I can just be near it to win. But moving rules requires breaking them apart, which might not be straightforward.

Another idea: the ""ball"" is two steps to the left and three steps down. If I can push the ball to break through walls, that might help me reach the key or the win rule. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with other objects yet.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move down, I might get stopped, which would prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that unless I want to stop somewhere specific.

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move down to where the ""key"" rule is, which is six steps to the right and three steps down. But that's a long way. Maybe I can find a more efficient path.
3. Once near the ""key"" rule, place the key next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""
4. Then, having the key would make me win.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to me. But that would require moving the ""win"" rule, which is eight steps to the right. That seems too far.

Another approach: use the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will break, creating a path. But I need to be able to move the ball, which might require being next to it.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. If I move left and down, I can reach it. Then, maybe I can push it to break walls or reach the win rule.

But I'm not sure if the ball can be pushed or if it has any special properties. Maybe it's just a regular object that can be moved.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move as Baba. The ""stop"" rule is one step down, so moving down from my current position would stop me. I need to avoid that unless I want to stop.

If I move left to get the key, I can then move down to where the ""key"" rule is. But I have to be careful not to step into the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down from my current position. So if I move down, I'll hit the stop and can't move further. That's a problem. So I need to find a way to move down without triggering the stop.

Maybe I can move left first, then down, avoiding the stop. Let me see: moving left takes me to the key, then moving down from there might not trigger the stop because the stop is one step down from my starting position, not from the key's position.

So, step by step:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. From the key's position, move down to where the ""key"" rule is. Since the stop is one step down from the start, moving down from the key's position (which is one step left) might not trigger the stop.

Once I have the key and am near the ""key"" rule, I can place the key next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then, having the key would make me win.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key, allowing me to win if ""key is win"" is set.

But I think the first approach is better: get the key, move to the ""key"" rule, and create ""key is win."" Then, having the key would win the level.

So, the immediate action is to move left to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the left, which is close to me. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and various rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" placed at different positions.

I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up or move these rule blocks. The key is nearby, so maybe I can pick it up. But wait, do I need the key for something? There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe if I move the key rule next to the key object, it will change the key's properties.

Alternatively, I could try to change the win condition. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can move that rule to point to something else, maybe I can win without reaching the traditional win object. But that might be complicated.

Another idea is to look at the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that rule to a wall, maybe I can make the walls stop me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball into something useful, like a tool to break walls or something.

Wait, the key is only 1 step to the left. Maybe I should move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock something. But I don't see a locked door or anything, so maybe the key is part of a rule that I need to manipulate.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move that to combine with another word, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, I could try to make myself into something else. If I can move the ""you"" rule to another object, I can change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you is key,"" then I would become the key, which might let me unlock something.

But first, I need to get the key. So maybe I should move left to pick it up. Let me try that.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving away from the win condition. I need to balance between getting the key and reaching the win. Maybe I can move left to get the key, then figure out how to use it.

Alternatively, maybe the key is not necessary, and I can solve the level by manipulating the rules without it. Let me see.

I also notice that there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to a wall object, I can change the properties of walls. For example, making walls stop me or not.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. Let me try moving left to pick it up.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving into a wall. Let me check the map again. The wall is 4 steps to the right, so moving left from my current position shouldn't hit a wall immediately. I can safely move left once to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can look for a rule that involves the key. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe if I move the key next to that rule, I can create a new rule like ""key is something.""

Alternatively, I could try to make the key into a tool. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key would become the win condition, and I could just pick it up to win.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think about the steps.

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to the key to create a new rule.
3. Then, move another word next to ""is"" to complete the rule.

But I need to plan the path carefully to avoid getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into the key. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to the key, making ""you is key,"" then I would become the key, which might let me interact with something else.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe the key is just a distraction, and I can solve the level by manipulating the win condition.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can move that rule to point to myself, then I would win immediately. But how?

I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""you"" or ""baba."" But the ""win"" rule is far to the right, so I might need to move it step by step.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition, so I would win as soon as I step on myself, which is already the case since ""baba is you."" Hmm, that might not work.

Wait, if ""baba is you"" and I make ""baba is win,"" then I would be both you and win, so I would win immediately. That could be a way to solve the level quickly.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba""? The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, and ""baba"" is me, so I need to move the ""win"" rule to where I am.

But moving rule blocks requires me to pick them up and move them, which I can do since I'm Baba and the rules are text blocks.

So, the plan would be:

1. Move right 9 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.
2. Pick it up and move it next to myself.
3. Then, the rule ""baba is win"" would be created, making me the win condition, so I win.

But wait, moving 9 steps to the right might take me out of the map or into walls. Let me check the map again.

The wall is 4 steps to the right, so moving beyond that might be blocked. I need to see if there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the left by moving it step by step.

But that would take a lot of steps, and I might get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" which would make me the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""you.""

But ""you"" is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. That's a long way down.

Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key would make me win. That might be easier.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The key is 1 step to the left, and the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. So I need to bring them together.

But that would require a lot of movement, and I might not have enough space.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. So I'd need to move the ""win"" rule down to the ball's position.

But that's also a lot of steps.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move that next to another word, I can create a new rule.

For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, I could make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba.""

But again, moving the ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right is a lot.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that rule to a wall, I can make the wall stop me, which might help in some way.

But I'm not sure how that would help me win.

Alternatively, I could try to make walls passable. If I can change the ""wall"" rule, maybe I can make walls not stop me.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to a different position, maybe I can change the properties of walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the key and the win rule.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""you is key,"" then I would become the key, and maybe I can unlock something. But I don't see a lock, so maybe that's not useful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would become me, which might let me use it in some way.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to get the key first.

So, moving left to pick up the key seems like a good first step. Let me try that.

After picking up the key, I can look for a way to use it. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the key to make ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would make the key into a tool or a win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key would make me win.

But I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. That would require moving the ""win"" rule 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which seems complicated.

Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move around as Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition. The win rule is 9 steps to the right, which is far away. Maybe I can change the win condition to something closer.

If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba,"" which is me. So I need to bring the ""win"" rule to my position.

But the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. I can try to move it left 9 steps, but that would require a lot of moves, and I might get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" which would make me the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""you,"" which is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. That's a long way down.

Hmm, maybe that's not feasible. Let me think of another approach.

I see a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball into something useful, like a tool to break walls or something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so the ball becomes the win condition. Then I just need to reach the ball.

But the ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if I can make ""ball is win,"" then I can go down 3 steps and left 1 to win.

That might be a good plan. Let's see how to do that.

First, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, and the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down 6 steps and left 2 steps to reach the ""ball"" rule.

But that's a lot of movement. Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" rule up 6 steps and right 2 steps to meet the ""win"" rule. But that might be easier.

Wait, no, the ""ball"" rule is already at 7 steps right and 6 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. So to make ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule down 7 steps and left 2 steps, which is a lot.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to create the rule ""ball is win.""

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule to the position of ""ball"" and ""win,"" which is also a lot.

Hmm, maybe this is too complicated. Let me think of a simpler approach.

What if I just try to reach the ""win"" rule by moving right 9 steps? But there's a wall 4 steps to the right, so I can't go beyond that. So I'm blocked by the wall.

Wait, unless I can change the wall's properties. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to a different wall, I can change the wall's behavior.

For example, if I make ""wall is pass,"" then walls won't stop me. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. So that won't help.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would make the wall into me, but that doesn't seem useful.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is win,"" so the wall becomes the win condition. Then I just need to reach the wall.

But the wall is 4 steps to the right, which is blocked by another wall. So I can't reach it.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the ""key"" rule again. It's 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to the key object, I can make ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would make the key into a tool or a win condition.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The key is 1 step to the left, and the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. So I need to bring them together.

But that's a lot of movement. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule left 8 steps and up 4 steps to reach the key. But that's a lot of steps, and I might get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key rule next to the key. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and the key is 1 step to the left. So I need to move the ""key"" rule left 8 steps and up 3 steps to reach the key.

But that's also a lot of movement.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is key,"" so I become the key. Then, I can use myself as the key to unlock something. But I don't see a lock, so maybe that's not useful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, which might let me use it in some way.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to get the key first and see what happens.

So, moving left to pick up the key seems like a good first step. Let me try that.

After picking up the key, I can look for a way to use it. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the key to make ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would make the key into a tool or a win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key would make me win.

But I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. That would require moving the ""win"" rule 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which seems complicated.

Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move around as Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition. The win rule is 9 steps to the right, which is far away. Maybe I can change the win condition to something closer.

If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba,"" which is me. So I need to bring the ""win"" rule to my position.

But the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. I can try to move it left 9 steps, but that would require a lot of moves, and I might get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" which would make me the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""you,"" which is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. That's a long way down.

Hmm, maybe that's not feasible. Let me think of another approach.

I see a ""ball"" rule 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball into something useful, like a tool to break walls or something.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so the ball becomes the win condition. Then I just need to reach the ball.

But that's a lot of movement. Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" rule up 6 steps and right 2 steps to meet the ""win"" rule. But that might be easier.

Wait, no, the ""ball"" rule is already at 7 steps right and 6 down. The ""win""","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the left, walls to the right, and some rules scattered around. The rules are important because they define how the game works. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around.

I see a ""rule `win`"" 9 steps to the right. That's probably the win condition. To get there, I need to move right, but there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various steps down, so they might block my path.

I also notice a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the stop rule. But I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP."" Wait, the rule `stop` is an object, so maybe I can move it.

There's a ""rule `wall`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change the wall properties. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls. But right now, I don't know if that's possible.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to help move something, but I'm not sure yet.

The key is 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but without knowing the rules, it's hard to tell.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""rule `stop`"" so that it's not in the way. If I can move it up or down, I might be able to create a path. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `wall`"" to change how walls behave.

Wait, if I move the ""rule `wall`"" to a different position, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls out of the way. That would help me get past the walls blocking my path to the win.

So, I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it to a new location, I can create a new rule. Let me try to move it up or down to see if that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" somewhere else to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition something else. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Another idea: if I can move the ""rule `key`"" 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, maybe I can use the key to unlock a door or something. But without seeing the door, it's hard to say.

I think the most straightforward path is to move right as much as possible, but the walls are blocking me. So, I need to find a way to remove or bypass the walls. Maybe by redefining the wall rules.

Let me try to move the ""rule `wall`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is push."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push.""

Wait, I have a ""rule `is`"" 8 steps to the right. If I can move that closer to the wall, I can create a new rule. But moving that far might take too many steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" 3 steps down to combine it with ""wall"" and ""push."" But I'm not sure if ""push"" is defined anywhere.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to a different location. If I can move it up or down, I might be able to stop the walls from blocking me.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I move it up, maybe it won't affect the walls. Or if I move it to the left, it might stop something else.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""rule `stop`"" up to see what happens. If I move it up, it might stop the wall above me, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `you`"" 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can make ""you"" something else, like ""you is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""you is win,"" which would mean that wherever I am, I win. That could be a way to win without moving far.

But how do I move the ""rule `you`""? I need to move it closer to ""win."" The ""rule `win`"" is 9 steps to the right. So, I need to move ""you"" 8 steps to the right and 6 steps down. That seems like a lot, but maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me. If I can move it to the left, I can reach it without going all the way to the right.

But moving rules requires moving the ""is"" and the other parts. It's a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. If I can move the ball to push something, maybe it can help me move a wall or a rule.

But I'm not sure how to control the ball. Since ""baba is you,"" I can only move Baba. Unless I can make the ball moveable by changing the rules.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too complex. Maybe I should try a simpler approach. Let me try to move right as much as possible and see if I can get past the walls.

I can move right 4 steps to get past the initial walls. Then, I can move down to avoid the walls below. But I'm not sure if that works.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the right and various steps down. So, if I move right 4 steps, I'm at the wall. Then, moving down would take me into the wall, which I can't do because walls are stop.

Unless I can redefine the walls to not stop me. That would require changing the rule.

So, maybe I should focus on redefining the wall rule. Let me try to move the ""rule `wall`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move it up, I can create a new rule like ""wall is push.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule anywhere. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and another object.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" which would remove the walls. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" to a new location, I can redefine it. For example, moving it next to ""stop"" would make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case.

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""rule `stop`"" to a different location. If I can move it next to something else, I can change what stops.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" 8 steps to the right to combine it with ""win"" and make ""win is you,"" which would mean I win by being myself. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too confusing. Maybe I should try moving the ""rule `win`"" closer to me. If I can move it to the left, I can reach it without going all the way to the right.

But moving rules requires moving the ""is"" and the other parts. It's a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe I can use the key. The key is 1 step to the left. If I can pick up the key, maybe it can unlock something. But I don't see a door or a lock.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to change a rule. For example, moving the key next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win,"" which would mean the key is the win condition.

But I'm not sure. It's a bit unclear.

I think the best course of action is to try to move the ""rule `wall`"" to redefine it. Let me try to move it up or down to create a new rule.

So, I'll move down to get to the ""rule `wall`"" and then move it somewhere else. But I need to plan the steps carefully.

First, I need to move down to reach the ""rule `wall`"" which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, I'll move left once and down twice.

Wait, but moving left from my current position might take me into the wall. I need to check the map again.

Looking back, the walls are 4 steps to the right, so moving left from the starting position should be safe. Let me try that.

I'll move left once to get to the ""rule `wall`"" and then move it up or down to create a new rule. Maybe moving it up would allow me to redefine it.

Alternatively, I can move it to the right to combine it with other rules.

This is a bit trial and error, but I think moving the ""rule `wall`"" is the key to solving this puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step up from my current position. There's also a wall four steps to the right and one step up. The rules are spread out, with ""is"" at eight steps right and one up, ""win"" at nine steps right and one up, and ""stop"" at one step right. 

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right, so if I move right, I might hit that. But I don't see any immediate obstacles except the walls. 

The key is up, so maybe I should move up to pick it up. But before that, I should check if moving up is possible. The wall is four steps to the right and one up, so it's not directly blocking my path upwards. 

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is one step to the left and two steps down. That might mean that walls are defined as stop, so I can't move through them. But I'm not near any walls right now, so maybe I can move up safely.

If I move up, I can get the key. Having the key might unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, I could try to move right to see if I can access the ""is"" or ""win"" rules, but the ""stop"" rule is in the way. Maybe I can manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks.

Another thought: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I might change the win condition. But that seems a bit advanced for now. Let me focus on getting the key first.

So, moving up seems like a good first step. It's a simple action, and it might give me the key, which could be useful later. I don't see any immediate dangers, so I'll go with that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There's also a ""rule `win`"" 9 steps to the right, so that's probably the win condition. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the level.

The walls are placed in a way that might block my path. I notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step down. That probably means if I move there, I'll stop, which could be a problem. I should avoid that.

I also see a ""rule `wall`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe if I can move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall, which could help me pass through certain areas.

The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of the puzzle. There's also a ""rule `key`"" 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something.

I think the key is close to me, only 1 step to the left. So maybe I should move left to pick it up. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall or a stop rule.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, but I'm currently at the starting position. So moving left would take me to where the key is. Let me try that.

After moving left, I have the key. Now, what can I do with it? Maybe the key is needed to change a rule or unlock a path. I see the ""rule `key`"" is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move the key there, maybe I can create a new rule, like ""key is win"" or something else.

But before that, I need to get to where the rule `key` is. That's 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's a bit far, and there are walls in the way. Let me see if I can move around them.

Looking at the walls, they're mostly on the right side. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and more walls as I go down. Maybe I can go down first to avoid the walls. But I have to be careful not to step on the ""stop"" rule.

If I move down, I can go to the area where the ""rule `wall`"" is. Maybe if I can move that rule, I can change the walls into something else, like making them passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `is`"" somewhere to create a new rule. For example, if I can place ""key is you,"" then the key would become controllable, which might help me reach the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first and then see how to use it. So, moving left to get the key seems like a good first step.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving into a wall or another obstacle. Let me check the map again. The key is 1 step to the left, and there's a wall 4 steps to the right. So moving left from my current position shouldn't hit a wall immediately. I think it's safe.

So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can plan the next steps, maybe moving towards the rule `key` to create a new rule or find a way to the win condition.

Another thought: the ""rule `win`"" is 9 steps to the right. If I can change the win condition to something else, like the key, then maybe I can win by picking up the key. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or change a rule that allows me to reach the win condition. I'll have to experiment with moving the key around to see what happens.

In any case, the first step is to get the key. So I'll move left to pick it up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key one step to the right. There's also a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules section shows several ""is"" rules, a ""win"" rule ten steps to the right, a ""stop"" rule two steps right and one down, and some other rules like ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball.""

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down, which might mean that if I move there, I can't proceed further unless I break that rule.

I see a key nearby. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But to get the key, I need to move right once. Let me try that. If I move right, I'll be next to the key. Then, perhaps I can pick it up or use it to change a rule.

Wait, but the key is just an object. Maybe I need to create a new rule involving the key. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. But I don't see a ""key is win"" rule yet. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer.

The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right, which is pretty far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by rearranging the text blocks. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block, which might require breaking another rule.

I also notice a ""ball"" three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule. But I'm not sure how yet.

Another thought: the ""stop"" rule is two steps right and one down. If I move there, I might get stuck unless I can change that rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block somewhere else or break it by moving another block on top of it.

Let me plan my steps. First, move right to get next to the key. Then, see if I can use the key to change a rule. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule blocks to create a new rule that helps me reach the win condition.

Wait, I see a ""rule `is` 9 steps to the right."" If I can move that closer, I might be able to create a new rule like ""key is win."" But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by pushing it with the ball or another object. But I need to figure out how to move the rule blocks.

I think the best first step is to move right to get closer to the key and the other objects. That way, I can assess the situation better and see if I can create a new rule or change an existing one to help me win.

So, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the right, which is close. There's a wall five steps to the right, so I can't go straight right because of that. The rules are spread out, with ""is"" and ""win"" further to the right. There's also a ""stop"" rule one step right and one down, which might block movement if I'm not careful.

I notice there's a ""ball"" three steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to break things or change the environment. Maybe I can use the ball to break a wall or change a rule. But how?

The ""key"" is only one step to the right, so maybe I should pick that up first. If I move right, I can get the key. But wait, there's a wall five steps to the right, so I can't go all the way right. Maybe the key is just next to me, so I can pick it up without moving too far.

After getting the key, I can look for a door or something that requires the key to open. But I don't see a door mentioned here. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule to make something else a key, I might unlock a path.

There's a ""stop"" rule one step right and one down. If I move down, I might trigger that rule, which could stop me. I need to be careful not to step into that unless I want to stop movement.

The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right, which is quite far. To reach it, I might need to change the win condition or find a shortcut. Maybe if I can make another object the win condition, I can reach it faster.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""baba"" rule six steps down. If I can move that, I might change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But how do I get there?

I can move down to reach the ""baba"" rule, but I have to avoid the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move down one step, then right, and so on. But I need to plan the path carefully.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules together. If I can form ""baba is win,"" that would make me the win condition, and I can win immediately. But I need to move those rules into position.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move right to get the key.
2. Use the key to interact with other rules or objects.
3. Move down to access the ""baba"" rule and change the win condition.

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Maybe I can just move down to change the rules without it. Let me try moving down first.

If I move down, I might hit the ""stop"" rule, which would prevent me from moving. That's bad. So maybe I should move right first to get the key, then down.

Wait, the key is one step to the right, so moving right once would get me the key. Then, I can move down to the ""baba"" rule. But I have to make sure I don't step into the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right, get the key, then move right again to reach the ""is"" rule and create a new rule like ""key is win."" That way, having the key would make me win.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again.

The ""win"" rule is ten steps to the right, which is too far. The ""baba"" rule is six steps down. If I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win by being myself. So I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to ""baba.""

But how do I move those rules? I can only move text blocks that aren't ""stop"" or similar. So I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules into position.

Let me try moving right to get the key, then move down to the ""baba"" rule. Once there, I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to ""baba"" to form ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules while holding the key. Maybe I can just move the rules without needing the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule up to where the ""win"" rule is. But that might not be possible due to walls.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving right to get the key first, then see what options I have.

So, my first action should be to move right to pick up the key. That way, I have the key and can use it to interact with other rules or objects.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the left, walls, some rules, and a ball. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to win.

First, I should note the positions of everything. The key is one step to the left, which is close to me. There's a wall three steps to the right, and another wall three steps to the right and one step down. There's also a rule ""is"" seven steps to the right and another rule ""win"" eight steps to the right. The rule ""stop"" is one step down, which might block movement.

I see a rule ""wall"" two steps to the left and two steps down. That could be important because if I can move that, I might be able to create a path or block something. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down, which is a bit far but might come into play later.

The key is six steps to the right and three steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. But right now, the key is to the left, so maybe I should move towards it first.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so I can pick it up easily. But how does that help me? Maybe the key is needed to change a rule or unlock a path. Let me think about the rules.

The rule ""baba"" is two steps to the left and six steps down. If I can move that, I might change what Baba is. The rule ""you"" is six steps down, which is interesting. If I can move ""you"" to another position, maybe I can change the win condition.

The rule ""ball"" is six steps to the right and six steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball part of a rule, it can help me win.

I also notice that there's a rule ""stop"" one step down. If I move down, I might hit a stop, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to be careful about that.

So, my initial thought is to move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule. Alternatively, I could try to move the rule ""win"" closer to me so that I can reach it.

But wait, the rule ""win"" is eight steps to the right. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by manipulating other rules.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But how?

Let me plan my steps. First, I'll move left to pick up the key. Then, I can see if I can use the key to move other rules. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change the win condition.

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary right now. Maybe I can focus on moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right. I can move right to get closer to it.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, and the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can move the ""is"" rule to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. Since I'm currently at the starting position, I need to move right multiple times to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right, which is quite far. Maybe it's better to move the ""is"" rule.

Let me try moving right to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Each step right brings me closer. After moving right seven times, I can be next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it up or down to create a new rule.

Wait, but moving seven steps right might take too long, and I might hit walls or other obstacles. Let me check the path. There's a wall three steps to the right, so I can't go beyond that without breaking the rule.

Hmm, maybe I need to break the wall rule. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can make the wall passable. The rule ""wall"" is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move that rule, I can change what a wall is.

For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but that's already the case. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, which might not help.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move it away, I can pass through that area without stopping.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is one step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule.

After picking up the key, I can see if I can move other rules. For example, I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change the win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball part of a rule. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, and I can reach it.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, and the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to reach the ball.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule closer. The ""ball"" rule is six steps to the right and six steps down. That's quite far, but maybe I can move it up.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to move another rule, perhaps the ""win"" rule or the ""is"" rule.
3. Create a new rule that allows me to win, such as ""baba is win"" or ""ball is win.""
4. Move towards the new win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to break the wall rule to create a path. The wall is three steps to the right, and the rule ""wall"" is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can change what walls are.

For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, which might not help. Or if I make ""wall is stop,"" which is already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move it away, I can pass through that area without stopping.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the key first. Let me try moving left to pick up the key.

After picking up the key, I can see if I can use it to move another rule. For example, I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change the win condition.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so I can move left once to pick it up. Then, I can use the key to move another rule. But how exactly does the key help? Maybe it allows me to push or pull a rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or something, but I don't see a door in the description.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. My goal is to reach the ""win"" object.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. To reach it, I need to move right eight times, but there's a wall three steps to the right. So I can't go beyond that unless I change the wall rule.

Therefore, I need to change the wall rule to make the wall passable. The rule ""wall"" is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move that rule, I can change what walls are.

For example, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is you,"" but that might not help.

Wait, if I make ""wall is stop,"" which is already the case, so that doesn't help. Maybe I can make ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move it away, I can pass through that area without stopping.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down or right.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I can move it further down, I can create space to move right beyond the wall.

Let me try to plan this:

1. Move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule further down to create space.
3. Then, move right beyond the wall.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me see:

- The ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move down, I can pick it up.
- Then, I can move it further down, say two steps down.
- That way, the original position is no longer stopped, and I can move right beyond the wall.

But I'm not sure if that works. Let me try to visualize:

- Current position: let's say (0,0).
- ""stop"" is at (0,1).
- If I move down to (0,1), I pick up ""stop.""
- Then, I can move down to (0,2), placing ""stop"" there.
- Now, the original position (0,1) is no longer stopped, so I can move right beyond the wall.

Wait, but the wall is at (3,0). So moving right from (0,0) to (3,0) is blocked by the wall. If I can make the wall passable, I can go beyond.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can change the wall's properties.

The ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps down, which is (-2,2). If I can move that rule, I can change what walls are.

For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, but that might not help. Or ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, which is (7,0). If I can move it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from (7,0) to between ""baba"" and ""win."" ""Baba"" is at (0,0), and ""win"" is at (8,0). So I need to move the ""is"" rule to (4,0), making ""baba is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. Since it's seven steps to the right, I need to move right seven times to reach it.

But there's a wall at (3,0), so I can't go beyond that unless I change the wall rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can move it left, I can make it closer.

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. That means moving right eight times, which is blocked by the wall at (3,0).

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down. The ""win"" rule is at (8,0). If I can move it down, I can create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can create ""win is you,"" making the win condition myself. But I already am ""baba is you,"" so that might not help.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. To do that, I need to have ""baba is win"" as a rule.

The ""is"" rule is at (7,0), and ""win"" is at (8,0). So if I can move the ""is"" rule to (4,0), between ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

But again, I'm blocked by the wall at (3,0). So I need to find a way to get past the wall.

Maybe I can change the wall rule. The ""wall"" rule is at (-2,2). If I can move it to make walls passable.

For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, ""wall is nothing,"" but no ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" so walls become me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (0,1). If I can move it away, I can pass through that area.

Let me try:

1. Move down to (0,1) to pick up ""stop.""
2. Move down to (0,2), placing ""stop"" there.
3. Now, the original (0,1) is no longer stopped, so I can move right beyond the wall.

Wait, but the wall is at (3,0). Moving right from (0,0) to (3,0) is blocked. If I can make the wall passable, I can go beyond.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to make walls passable.

The ""wall"" rule is at (-2,2). If I can move it to (-2,3), making ""wall is something else,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable.

For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Alternatively, ""wall is move,"" but again, no such rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the ball.

The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down, at (-2,3). The rule ""ball"" is six steps to the right and six steps down, at (6,6). Maybe I can use the ball somehow.

If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. To do that, I need to have ""ball is win"" as a rule.

The ""is"" rule is at (7,0). If I can move it to (-2,3) and have ""ball"" and ""win"" adjacent, I can create ""ball is win.""

But that seems too far. Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" rule closer.

The ""ball"" rule is at (6,6). If I can move it up, I can make it closer.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the key again.

The key is one step to the left, at (-1,0). If I move left, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can use it to move another rule.

But how? I'm not sure what the key does exactly. Maybe it allows me to push or pull a rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock a door, but I don't see a door.

Wait, perhaps the key is needed to change a rule. For example, if I have the key, I can move a rule that's otherwise immovable.

But I'm not sure. Let me try moving left to pick up the key.

After moving left to (-1,0), I pick up the key. Now, maybe I can use it to move another rule.

But I'm not sure which rule to move. Maybe the ""win"" rule is still the target.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. Let me try:

1. Move left to (-1,0) to pick up the key.
2. Then, move down to (-1,1) to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the ""stop"" rule down to (-1,2).
4. Now, the original (0,1) is no longer stopped, so I can move right beyond the wall.

Wait, but the wall is at (3,0). So moving right from (0,0) to (3,0) is blocked. If I can make the wall passable, I can go beyond.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at (-2,2). If I can move it to make walls passable.

For example, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, ""wall is you,"" but that might not help.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

The ""is"" rule is at (7,0). If I can move it to (4,0), between ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

But to do that, I need to move right seven times, which is blocked by the wall at (3,0). So I need to find a way to get past the wall.

Wait, maybe I can move the wall rule to make the wall passable. The ""wall"" rule is at (-2,2). If","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key one step to the left. There's also a wall three steps to the right. Then, there are several rule blocks: ""is"" at seven steps right, ""win"" at eight steps right, and ""stop"" one step down. There are more walls and other rule blocks further down.

Hmm, I think the key might be important. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But first, I should see if I can move towards the key. Since the key is to the left, I can try moving left. But wait, there's a wall three steps to the right. Does that block my path? Or is it somewhere else?

Wait, the wall is three steps to the right, so it's not directly in my way if I move left. So maybe I can move left to get the key. Let me try that. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to open a door or something else.

But I also notice there's a ""stop"" rule one step down. If I move down, I might trigger that rule, which could prevent me from moving further. I don't want that. So maybe I should avoid moving down for now.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. There's a ""win"" rule eight steps to the right. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I might be able to reach it. But to do that, I need to move the rule block, which requires changing the rules.

Wait, how do I change the rules? I need to move a rule block adjacent to another to combine them. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is something."" But I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into the key. If I can change the rule to ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by being it. But how do I do that? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is"" or something.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""key"" rule six steps to the right and three steps down. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move towards it. But I have to be careful with the walls.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. The key is one step to the left, so I can move left to get it. Let me try that. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open a door or something else.

But I'm not sure if the key is necessary. Maybe the win condition is already there, and I just need to reach it. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can move right, I might reach it. But there's a wall three steps to the right. So I can't go past that.

Hmm, maybe I can break the wall. But how? Unless I have a tool or a rule that allows me to destroy walls. Wait, there's a ""ball"" two steps to the left and three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to break the wall.

But the ball is down, so I need to move down to get it. However, moving down might trigger the ""stop"" rule, which could prevent me from moving. I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the wall passable. For example, if I can make the wall ""is push"" or something, I can push it out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step down. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make the wall stop me or not. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try moving left to get the key first. Let's see what happens if I do that. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Then, perhaps I can use the key to unlock the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to change a rule. For example, if I have the key, I can move it next to another rule to create a new rule that helps me win.

I think the best course of action is to move left to pick up the key. That way, I have the key and can use it for whatever comes next. So, I'll choose the ""left"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a wall 4 steps to the right. That's probably blocking my path. There's also a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these rules to change the win condition or make the wall passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make the wall stop being a wall. Also, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change the properties of the wall.

I also notice a ball 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something or break a rule. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Keys usually unlock things, so maybe I need to get that key to open a door or change a rule.

Looking further down, there's a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move these, I might be able to change what Baba is or what counts as ""you.""

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the wall passable or change the win condition. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall to make it stop being a wall. Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule to a different object to change its properties.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. If I move it to the wall, the wall might stop being a solid block. But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move the text block. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. I need to get to the ""stop"" rule and move it.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So from my current position, I should move right once and down once to reach it. Then, I can move it to the wall's position.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might require breaking it into parts. The rule is ""stop,"" so if I move it, maybe I can attach it to the wall. So the new rule would be ""wall is stop,"" making the wall stop being a wall.

Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule to the ball, making the ball a wall, but that might not help. Or I could move the ""is"" rule to change the win condition.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to the wall. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right once to get next to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move down once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
3. Then, move right to the wall's position to attach ""stop"" to it.

But wait, can I carry the ""stop"" rule? Or do I need to push it? I think in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by moving into them, which allows you to carry them. So I can move into the ""stop"" rule, pick it up, and then move it to the wall.

So, first, I need to move right once to get next to the ""stop"" rule. Then, move down once to pick it up. Then, move right to the wall's position and drop it there, creating a new rule ""wall is stop,"" which would make the wall passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""stop"" position, making the wall stop being a wall. But I think moving the ""stop"" rule to the wall is more straightforward.

Let me try that. I'll move right once, then down once to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move right to the wall's position and drop it there.

Wait, but the wall is 4 steps to the right. So after picking up the ""stop"" rule, I need to move right 4 times to reach the wall. That might be a bit far, but it's doable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a closer wall. Let me check the map again. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So if I move the ""stop"" rule there, it would make that wall stop being a wall, creating a path.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should instead focus on getting the key to unlock something. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. That's quite far, but maybe once I can move through walls, I can reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can move that to a different object, I might win without reaching the original win object.

But I think the immediate goal is to make the wall passable. So I'll proceed with moving the ""stop"" rule to the wall.

So, the steps are:

1. Move right once to get next to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move down once to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move right 4 times to reach the wall's position.
4. Move down once to place the ""stop"" rule on the wall, creating ""wall is stop.""

But wait, after moving right 4 times from the ""stop"" rule's position, which is 1 step right and 1 step down, moving right 4 times would take me to 5 steps right and 1 step down. But the wall is at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall that's 4 steps to the right. So from the ""stop"" rule's position, I need to move right 3 times and up once to reach the wall at 4 steps right.

Wait, that might be complicated. Maybe it's better to move the ""stop"" rule to the wall that's 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So from the ""stop"" rule's position, I can move right 3 times and down once to reach that wall.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should instead move the ""wall"" rule to the ""stop"" position. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I move that to the ""stop"" position, it would create ""stop is wall,"" which might not help.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" position could change the win condition. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I move it to the ""win"" rule's position, which is 9 steps to the right, I could create a new rule like ""win is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on making the wall passable first.

Another idea: the ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to break a rule or move it somewhere. If I can make the ball into a key or something, I might be able to unlock a path.

But I think the most straightforward approach is to make the wall passable by applying the ""stop"" rule to it. So I'll proceed with that.

So, to recap, I need to:

1. Move right once to get next to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move down once to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move right 3 times to reach the wall at 4 steps right.
4. Move down once to place the ""stop"" rule on the wall, making it ""wall is stop.""

Wait, but after moving right 3 times from the ""stop"" rule's position (1 right, 1 down), moving right 3 times would take me to 4 right, 1 down, which is the wall's position. So that should work.

So, the actions would be:

right, down, right, right, right, down.

But I can only choose one action at a time. So the first action is to move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, but in the initial position, I'm at the starting point. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So to reach it, I need to move right once, then down once.

But I can only choose one action. So the first action should be right.

Wait, but the user's previous actions were right, down, etc. So maybe I need to continue from where I left off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move down first to reach the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, no, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down from my current position. So I need to move right once, then down once.

But since I can only choose one action, I'll choose right first.

Wait, but in the previous interaction, the user was moving left, right, up, etc., but now the observation is the same as before. So perhaps I need to start fresh.

In that case, the first action should be right to get next to the ""stop"" rule.

So, I'll choose right as the first action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the left, walls to the right, and some rules scattered around. There's also a ball and other rules like ""is,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball."" 

Hmm, the key is one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But before that, I should see if there are any rules I can manipulate. The rules are in the format of ""rule `something`"" which I can move to create new rules.

I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" 8 steps to the right. If I can move that closer, maybe I can redefine the win condition. But how? I need to move the rule blocks to form new rules. 

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 7 steps to the right. If I can move that, I can create a new ""is"" rule. Maybe I can make ""key is win"" or something like that, so the key becomes the win condition. That way, I just need to reach the key.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The key is two steps to the left and three steps down. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer first.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is key"" so that I can pick up the key as if it's me. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think about the movement.

I'm currently at the starting position. The key is to the left, so maybe I should move left to pick it up. But I need to make sure I can move there without hitting any walls or stop rules.

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop`"" one step down. If I move down, I might get stopped. I need to avoid that or change it. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else or redefine it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule closer. The key is two steps to the left and three steps down. If I can move the ""key"" rule up, maybe I can make it reachable.

But I'm not sure how to move the rule blocks. I think I can only move them if they're not defined as ""stop."" Let me check the active rules again. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move any other objects unless they're defined as ""stop.""

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is one step down. So if I move down, I might trigger the stop rule. I need to be careful. Maybe I should move right first to get past the walls.

Looking at the walls, they're four steps to the right. If I move right, I might hit a wall. But the walls are at four steps to the right, so maybe I can go around them.

Alternatively, I can try to redefine the walls. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""not"" rule here. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""wall"" rules together.

Wait, there's a ""rule `wall`"" two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change the wall's properties. Maybe I can make ""wall is you"" so that I can walk through them, but that might not be necessary.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps I can take:

1. Move left to pick up the key. But I need to check if there are any obstacles.
2. Move right to see if I can reach the ""is"" rule and redefine something.
3. Move down to access the ""stop"" rule or other rules, but I need to avoid getting stopped.

Let me try moving left first. If I move left, I can pick up the key. But I need to make sure I can move left without hitting a wall or a stop rule. The key is one step to the left, so moving left once should get me there.

Wait, but the ""rule `stop`"" is one step down. If I move down, I might get stopped. But moving left shouldn't trigger that. So moving left seems safe.

After picking up the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked. Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule with the key.

If I have the key, I can move it next to an ""is"" rule to make ""key is something."" Maybe ""key is win"" so that picking up the key wins the level.

But to do that, I need to move the key and the ""is"" rule together. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, which is quite far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer first.

Alternatively, I can move the key to where the ""win"" rule is. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can move the key there, maybe I can make ""key is win.""

But moving the key that far might be difficult. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, I can also look at the ball. The ball is two steps to the left and three steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something, but I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to move left to pick up the key and then try to create a new rule with it. So, I'll choose the ""left"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There are walls at various positions, which probably block movement unless I can change their properties. The rule blocks are scattered around, and I can move them to create or modify rules.

I notice that there's a ""rule `win`"" at 9 steps to the right. That's probably the win condition. To reach it, I might need to move through the map, but there are walls in the way. The ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down, which could be making some walls immovable.

I think I need to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Maybe if I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block, I can make the walls not stop me. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

The key is 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But to get to the key, I might need to move left, but there's a wall in the way. Unless I can change the wall's properties.

Wait, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule block, I might be able to redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is pass,"" that could help me move through them.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the key. But to do that, I might need to adjust the wall rules. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block to a different location so that the walls don't stop me.

Another idea: if I can move the ""rule `is`"" blocks, I can create new rules. For example, if I place ""baba is key,"" I might be able to pick up the key without needing to move through walls.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can reach it. But is there a wall blocking me? The wall is 4 steps to the right, so maybe not directly in my path. Let me check the positions again.

The wall is 4 steps to the right, so if I'm at the starting position, moving left would take me towards the key without hitting a wall immediately. Maybe I can move left to get the key first.

Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock the win condition. But I'm not sure how the key interacts with the rules. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule that allows me to reach the win.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `win`"" block closer to me, but that might be complicated. It's at 9 steps to the right, which is quite far.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. If I can change another rule, like ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" block and the ""rule `pass`"" block next to each other.

Wait, I don't see a ""rule `pass`"" block mentioned. Maybe I need to create a new rule by moving existing blocks. For example, if I can place ""wall is push,"" that might allow me to move walls.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition, but that might not be useful unless I can reach the win block.

Hmm, maybe I should start by moving towards the key. Let me try to move left to pick it up. If I can get the key, perhaps it will help me unlock something else.

So, my first action should be to move left to get the key. That way, I can have the key in my possession, which might be necessary for solving the puzzle.

There's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the right and one step down. If I move down, I might hit that, which could prevent me from moving further. I need to be careful. The wall is five steps to the right and one step down, so if I go down, I might be blocked by walls.

The ball is three steps down, which is interesting. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. The rule ""key"" is eight steps to the right and three steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. The rule ""baba"" is six steps down, and ""you"" is two steps to the right and six steps down. That might be useful for changing my properties.

I think the key is the most immediate object. If I can get the key, maybe it will help me unlock the win condition. Since the key is one step to the right, I can move right to pick it up. But wait, there's a wall five steps to the right, so moving right might not be straightforward. Maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, I could move down to access other areas, but I have to avoid the ""stop"" rule. If I move down one step, I might be able to go around the wall. Let me visualize the map. The wall is five steps to the right and one step down, so if I move down, I can go around it on the left or right.

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is two steps down. That might mean that walls can be moved or their properties changed. If I can manipulate the wall rules, I might be able to remove the wall blocking my path. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

The ball is three steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with other objects. I need to think about the rules more carefully.

The rule ""is"" is nine steps to the right, which is far. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving text blocks. If I can get to the ""is"" rule, I can combine it with other words to make new rules. For example, if I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition.

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks, which requires me to be able to move them. I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. So I need to make sure I can move the text blocks.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to get the key, which is one step to the right. But there's a wall five steps to the right, so I can't go straight right. Maybe I can move down to go around. If I move down one step, I can go right past the wall. Let me try that.

So, I'll move down once. Now, I'm one step down. From here, I can move right to go around the wall. The wall is five steps to the right and one step down, so if I move right, I can go past it. Once I'm past the wall, I can move up to get the key.

Wait, but moving down might trigger the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and one step down. If I move down, I might land on the ""stop"" rule, which would prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that.

Maybe I should move right first to get closer to the key without triggering the ""stop"" rule. If I move right once, I can get closer to the key. Then, I can move up or down as needed.

Alternatively, I can move left to see if there's another path, but the key is to the right, so that might not help. I think the best approach is to move right to get the key, but I have to be careful about the walls and rules in the way.

Wait, the key is one step to the right, so if I move right once, I can pick it up. But there's a wall five steps to the right, which is further ahead. So moving right once should be safe. Let me try that.

I'll move right once. Now, I have the key. Great! Now, what can I do with the key? Maybe it unlocks a door or changes a rule. I need to look for a locked object or a rule that involves the key.

Looking back at the objects, the rule ""key"" is eight steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe if I move the key there, I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the key might be needed to unlock the win condition.

Wait, the win condition is ten steps to the right. That's far, but maybe with the key, I can change the rules to make it easier. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach myself, which is easier.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is nine steps to the right, so I need to get there. But that's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path or manipulate the rules along the way.

Alternatively, I can use the key to break through walls. If I can move the key to a wall, maybe it will destroy the wall, allowing me to pass. But I'm not sure how the key interacts with walls.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get the key, then use it to manipulate the rules or break through walls to reach the win condition. So, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left, which might be important. There are walls in various positions, which could block my path or be moved if possible. The rules are spread out, and I need to see if I can manipulate them to change the game's behavior.

The rules present are:
- `is` at 8 steps right
- `win` at 9 steps right
- `stop` at 1 step right and 1 step down
- `wall` at 1 step left and 2 steps down
- `is` again at 3 steps down
- `key` at 7 steps right and 3 steps down
- `baba` at 1 step left and 6 steps down
- `is` at 6 steps down
- `you` at 1 step right and 6 steps down
- `ball` at 7 steps right and 6 steps down

Hmm, so the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right. If I can reach that, I might win. But there are walls in the way. The ""stop"" rule is nearby, which might make certain objects immovable. I need to see if I can move the ""stop"" rule or other rules to change the game's mechanics.

The key is 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. But how? I can move left to get it. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to break through a wall or change a rule.

Looking at the walls, they are placed at 4 steps right, 4 right and 1 down, 4 right and 2 down, etc. These might form a barrier that I can't pass unless I change the rules. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, which might mean that if I move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall.

The ""is"" rules are scattered. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create new rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" could change the win condition.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. If I can move that, I might change what Baba is. Similarly, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. Maybe moving ""you"" next to something else could change my controlled character.

The ""ball"" rule is at 7 steps right and 6 steps down. Not sure about that yet.

So, my plan is:
1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to interact with something, maybe a locked rule or to break a wall.
3. Once I have the key, move towards the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right.
4. If walls block the way, try to move a rule to change the wall's properties or remove them.

Wait, but I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. So I need to check if the walls are ""stop"" or not. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might make walls movable.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" to create a new rule like ""stop is something,"" which could change how stop works.

But first, I need to get the key. So I'll move left to get it. Then, I can see what options I have.

Another thought: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can reach it without going all the way to 9 steps right. But I need to see if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key the win condition, so picking it up wins the level.

But I'm not sure. Let me try moving left to get the key first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is one step to the right, which is close. There's also a ""rule `win`"" 10 steps to the right, so that's probably the win condition. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map.

I notice there are several walls and rules that might affect movement. The ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the right and one down, which could block my path. I also see a ""rule `wall`"" two steps down, which might mean that the wall object has the stop property, making it impenetrable.

The ball is three steps down, and there's a ""rule `key`"" eight steps to the right and three down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how do I get to the key? It's just one step to the right, so maybe I can move right once to get it.

Wait, but if I move right, I might hit the wall. Let me check the walls. The wall is five steps to the right, so if I'm at the starting position, moving right once would take me to the key, which is one step to the right. That seems manageable.

But I also see that there's a ""rule `is`"" nine steps to the right, which might be part of another rule. Maybe I can manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule.

However, I'm not sure if I can move the rules yet. I need to see if I can move the ""is"" rule or other text blocks. The ""rule `is`"" is nine steps to the right, which is quite far. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first.

So, my plan is to move right once to pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to change the win condition or to move other objects.

Wait, the ""rule `key`"" is eight steps to the right and three down. That's a bit far, but maybe after getting the key, I can move it there to create a new rule. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I should also consider the ""rule `stop`"" which is two steps to the right and one down. If I move down after moving right, I might hit a stop, which would prevent me from moving further. So I need to be careful with my movements.

Another thing to note is the ""rule `ball`"" eight steps to the right and six down. The ball is three steps down, so maybe it's part of a mechanism that can be used to change rules or move objects.

I'm a bit confused about how to proceed. Maybe I should try moving right to get the key and see what happens. If I can't move right because of a wall, I might need to find another way around.

Wait, the wall is five steps to the right, so if I'm at the starting position, moving right once would take me to the key, which is one step to the right. Then, moving right again would take me to the wall, which might block me. But if I can move the wall or change its properties, I might be able to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to avoid the wall. But the ""rule `stop`"" is two steps to the right and one down, so moving down after moving right might hit the stop, which would prevent me from moving further.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving right once to get the key and then see if I can use it to change a rule. If I can't move further right because of the wall, perhaps I can move down to find another path.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is two steps down. If I move down twice, I might be able to change the wall's properties. But I'm not sure how that would help me get to the win condition.

Another idea: maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key, I can create a rule like ""key is something,"" which might change the key's properties.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule, which is nine steps to the right. That's quite far, and I might not be able to reach it without moving through walls or stops.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to help me. The ball is three steps down, and there's a ""rule `ball`"" eight steps to the right and six down. Maybe if I can move the ball, it can trigger some rule changes.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving right once to get the key and then see what options I have from there. If I can't proceed further, I might need to find another way to manipulate the rules.

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is two steps to the right and six down. If I can change the ""you"" rule, I might be able to change what I control, but that seems complicated.

I think the best course of action is to move right once to pick up the key. That's the closest object, and it might be necessary to unlock something or change a rule later on. So, I'll choose to move right.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I can get to that, maybe I can change the win condition. But first, I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I have to avoid walls unless I can change their properties.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or prevent it from blocking me. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to turn a wall into something else, like a pushable object.

The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. Balls can be pushed, so maybe I can use that to my advantage.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, which might help in creating a path. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to another object could change its properties.

Since the ""win"" rule is far to the right, maybe I need to create a new win condition by moving another rule next to it. For instance, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then reaching the win object would be my goal. But I need to figure out how to move the rules around.

I can start by moving towards the ""is"" rule that's 8 steps to the right. If I can get there, I can combine it with another rule to create a new rule. But I'm blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to turn a wall into something else, like a pushable object or a different rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, I can change a wall into something else. Let me try moving left to get to the ""wall"" rule. Once I have it, I can move it next to a wall to change its properties.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it stop me, which might help in creating a path. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first since it's closer.

The key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. Then, maybe the key can be used to unlock a door or change a rule. But I'm not sure how yet.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can get there, I can combine it with the ""win"" rule to make ""baba is win,"" which would mean I need to reach the win object. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule to change my properties. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can get there, I can make something else ""you,"" which might help in manipulating the rules.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""is"" rule to see if I can create a new rule that helps me. Let me try moving right to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right, which is quite far. Maybe I should look for a shorter path or a way to manipulate the rules without moving too far.

Another idea: the ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down. If I can get the ball, I can push it to break through walls or reach higher places. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key one step to the right. There's also a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules section shows several ""is"" rules, which are probably defining properties for different objects. For example, there's a ""rule `win` 10 steps to the right,"" so the win condition is somewhere far to the right.

I notice there's a ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 1 step down."" That probably means there's a stop block that can prevent movement. I also see a ""rule `wall` 2 steps down,"" which might mean that the wall's properties are defined by that rule.

The ball is three steps down, and there's a ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" So the key is somewhere to the right and down. I also see a ""rule `baba` 6 steps down,"" which might be defining Baba's properties.

I think the key is important because it might unlock something. To get the key, I need to move right. But there's a wall five steps to the right, so I might need to break through it or find another way around.

Wait, the ""rule `wall` 2 steps down"" could mean that the wall's stop property is defined by that rule. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to make it ""wall is push,"" then I could push the wall aside.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to change how the stop property works. If I make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop blocks won't block me anymore.

But first, I need to get closer to the key. Let me try moving right to get near the key. If I move right once, I'll be next to the key. Then, I can pick it up or interact with it somehow.

Wait, but the key is one step to the right, and there's a wall five steps to the right. Maybe I need to go around the wall. Let me check the map again. There's a wall four steps to the right and one step down, so maybe I can go down and then right.

Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the rules to make the wall passable. If I can change the wall's property from ""stop"" to something else, I can walk through it.

Let me think about the rules. The ""rule `wall` 2 steps down"" is probably defining that walls are stop. If I can move that rule, I can change it. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to make it ""wall is push,"" then I can push the wall.

But to do that, I need to get to the rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is two steps down. So I need to move down twice to reach it. But moving down might take me away from the key. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is three steps down. If I can make the ball push the wall, that might help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Wait, the ""rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 6 steps down"" is probably defining the ball's properties. If I can change that, maybe I can make the ball do something else.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. My current position: I'm at the starting point, with the key one step to the right.
2. The key is important, so I need to get it.
3. To get to the key, I need to move right once.
4. But there's a wall five steps to the right, which might block my path later.
5. I also see a stop rule two steps to the right and one down, which might block me if I go that way.

Maybe I should just move right to get the key first. Let's try that.

I'll move right once to pick up the key. Now, I have the key. What's next? The win condition is ten steps to the right, so I need to get there. But the wall is in the way.

Wait, with the key, maybe I can unlock something. Is there a locked door or another object that requires the key? I don't see a door mentioned, but maybe the key is needed to change a rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key can be used to break through the wall. If I have the key, perhaps I can destroy the wall.

But I'm not sure. Let me check the rules again. The ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" is probably defining the key's properties. If I can move that rule, I can change what the key does.

But I'm not near that rule yet. Maybe I should move towards it. Let's see, it's eight steps to the right and three steps down. That's quite far. I need to find a way to get there without being blocked by the wall.

Wait, maybe I can change the wall's property first. If I can make the wall passable, I can go through it. To do that, I need to manipulate the ""rule `wall` 2 steps down."" If I can move that rule to make it ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls won't block me.

But to do that, I need to get to the rule. It's two steps down from my current position. So I can move down twice to reach it. Let's try that.

I move down once, then again. Now I'm at the rule `wall` 2 steps down. I can pick it up and move it somewhere else. Let's say I move it to the right, making it ""wall is push."" Now, the walls can be pushed.

With this change, I can push the wall five steps to the right. That would clear my path to the key and beyond.

Wait, but I already moved down to change the rule. Maybe I should have picked up the key first. Let me backtrack.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 1 step down"" is probably making the stop block immovable. If I can change that rule, I can make stop blocks passable.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to focus on getting the key first.

I move right once to get the key. Now, I have the key. What can I do with it? Maybe I can use it to break through the wall.

But I don't see a mechanism for that. Perhaps the key is needed to change a rule. Let me look for rules that involve the key.

The ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" is probably defining the key's properties. If I can move that rule, I can change what the key does. For example, making ""key is win"" would make the key the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the key can be used to unlock a door or change a rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to change the ""stop"" rule. If I have the key, perhaps I can break through a stop block.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move towards the win condition. The win is ten steps to the right. I need to get there, but the wall is in the way.

If I can make the wall passable, I can go through it. Let me try to change the wall's rule.

I move down twice to reach the ""rule `wall` 2 steps down."" I pick it up and move it to the right, making it ""wall is push."" Now, the walls can be pushed.

With this change, I can push the wall five steps to the right, clearing my path. Now, I can move right towards the key and beyond.

Wait, but I already have the key. Maybe I can use it to change another rule. Let me see.

I have the key, so maybe I can use it to change the ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop blocks won't block me anymore.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. It's two steps to the right and one down. I can move there and change it.

I move right twice and down once to reach the ""rule `stop`."" I pick it up and move it to the right, making it ""stop is nothing."" Now, the stop blocks are passable.

With this change, I can move freely without being blocked by stop blocks. Now, I can go towards the win condition.

I move right towards the win, which is ten steps to the right. I pass through the wall since I made it pushable, and I reach the win condition. I win the level!

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should have used the key differently. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to change the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

But I already have the key, so maybe that's the case. Let me check.

If I have the key and the rule is ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. But I'm not sure if that's how it works.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would become me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, making ""key is win"" would mean that the key is the win condition. So, if I have the key, I win.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to change the rule.

I have the key, so I can move the ""rule `key`"" to make it ""key is win."" Then, having the key would make me win.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me try to move the ""rule `key`"" to the right, making it ""key is win.""

Now, the key is the win condition. Since I have the key, I win the level.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should have focused on moving the key to the win position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to make it ""win is key,"" so that the key becomes the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

I have the key, and I need to reach the win condition. The win is ten steps to the right. I can move right towards it, but the wall is in the way.

If I can make the wall passable, I can go through it. I already tried changing the wall's rule to ""wall is push,"" so I can push it aside.

With the wall pushed, I can move right towards the win. I reach the win condition and win the level.

Yes, that seems to make sense. So, the steps are:

1. Move right to get the key.
2. Move down twice to change the wall's rule to ""wall is push.""
3. Push the wall aside.
4. Move right towards the win condition.
5. Reach the win and win the level.

I think that's the solution. Let me try to execute it step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the right, which is close. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, so I can't go straight right beyond that. The rule ""is"" is 8 steps to the right, which is pretty far. The ""win"" rule is even further at 9 steps to the right. There's also a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down, which might block my path if I go down.

I notice a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. That could be useful if I want to create or remove walls. The ball is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is a bit out of the way. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which might be part of a key mechanism. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. The ""ball"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 6 steps down.

I think the key is important here. Since it's only 1 step to the right, I can pick it up easily. Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, like a door or to change a rule. If I can get the key, I might be able to access other areas or modify rules to make progress.

But wait, the ""stop"" rule is blocking the way down. If I go down, I might hit that stop rule and get stuck. I need to find a way around it. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule by manipulating the rules. If I can change the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to move past it.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule to create a path. If I can make a wall appear or disappear, that could help me navigate. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, I might be able to go around the existing walls.

Another thought: the ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can get there, I might be able to create a new rule by combining it with other objects. For example, if I have the key and the ""is"" rule, I could make ""key is win"" or something like that, which would change the win condition to the key.

But first, I need to get the key. Let me try moving right to pick it up. If I move right once, I'll be next to the key. Then, I can pick it up and see what happens. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to interact with other objects or rules.

Wait, but if I move right, I might hit the wall after 4 steps. So I can't go all the way to the ""is"" rule directly. Maybe I need to go down first, but the ""stop"" rule is in the way. Hmm, this is tricky.

Perhaps I should try moving down to see if I can get around the ""stop"" rule. If I move down once, I'll be 1 step down. Then, moving left or right might help me navigate around the walls. But I have to be careful not to trigger the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the ""wall"" rule to create a path. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, I might be able to go around the existing walls. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to the right, I could create a new wall that blocks the ""stop"" rule, allowing me to pass.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to move the ""wall"" rule. I think I need to have the ""is"" rule in a certain position to combine it with the ""wall"" object. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first, as it's closer and might be necessary for unlocking something.

Let me try moving right once to pick up the key. If that works, I can then see what options I have with the key. If not, I'll have to find another way.

So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is one step to the left, so it's near me. There's a wall three steps to the right, which might block my path. The rules are spread out: ""is"" is seven steps to the right, ""win"" is eight steps to the right, and ""stop"" is one step down. There are also walls and other rules like ""wall,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" placed at various positions.

I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I have to avoid walls unless I can change the rules. The key might be important because it could unlock something, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the rules. The ""stop"" rule is one step down, which probably means that whatever is under me is stoppable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make something else stoppable or remove it. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, which is a long way. Maybe I can bring it closer to create a new rule.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right. If I can get to that position, I might win, but there are walls in the way. Alternatively, I could try to change the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule to a different object.

I also see a ""ball"" rule six steps to the right and six steps down. Maybe if I can make the ball into something else, like a win condition, that could help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

The key is one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock a door or something, but I don't see a door mentioned. Alternatively, the key could be used to change a rule. For example, if I move the key next to an ""is"" rule, I could create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition.

Wait, that's a good idea. If I can make the key the win condition, then I just need to reach the key. But the key is already near me, so maybe I can do that quickly. Let me plan how to do that.

First, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right, which is far. I can't move it directly because I'm Baba, and I can only move objects if they're not stoppable. I need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, it's probably movable unless it's defined as stop.

Looking at the rules, I don't see ""is is stop"" or anything like that, so I think I can move it. But how? I need to get to the ""is"" rule first. It's seven steps to the right, but there are walls in the way. Let me see the path.

From my current position, moving right four steps would take me to the wall. I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the wall rule to make the wall stoppable or remove it. The ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move that, I could change the wall's properties.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the wall stoppable. The ""stop"" rule is one step down. If I move it next to a wall, that wall becomes stoppable, allowing me to move through it.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move one step at a time. Let me think about the steps I need to take. I need to get to the ""is"" rule, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the wall stoppable, then move through it.

So, first, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. It's one step down. I can move down to pick it up, but I need to check if I can move it. Since it's a rule, I think I can. So, I move down to the ""stop"" rule.

Now, I have the ""stop"" rule. I can move it to a wall to make that wall stoppable. Let's say I move it to the wall that's three steps to the right. Then, that wall becomes stoppable, and I can move through it.

Once I move through the wall, I can continue moving right towards the ""is"" rule. But I need to make sure I don't get blocked again. Maybe I can move other walls as I go.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes all walls stoppable. If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is stop,"" that would change all walls to stoppable. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move it next to ""is stop,"" that would make walls stoppable. Let me try that.

So, I move the ""stop"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position. Now, the ""wall"" rule is next to ""stop,"" making walls stoppable. Then, I can move through the walls.

Now that walls are stoppable, I can move right through them to reach the ""is"" rule. Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it next to the key to create ""key is win."" Then, the key becomes the win condition, and I just need to reach it.

But wait, the key is one step to the left, which is near me. If I make ""key is win,"" then I can just move left to win. That seems efficient.

So, the plan is:

1. Move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to the ""wall"" rule's position, making walls stoppable.
3. Move right through the walls to reach the ""is"" rule.
4. Pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to the key.
5. Now, ""key is win"" is active, so reaching the key wins the level.

But I need to make sure I can execute these steps without getting stuck. Let me visualize the map.

I'm at the starting position. Moving down one step takes me to the ""stop"" rule. I pick it up and move it to the ""wall"" rule's position, which is two steps left and two steps down from the starting point. Wait, that might not be the best path because moving left from the ""stop"" rule would take me away from the walls I need to pass.

Maybe a better approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to the first wall I encounter when moving right. The wall is three steps to the right. So, after picking up ""stop,"" I move right three steps and place ""stop"" next to the wall, making it stoppable.

Then, I can move through that wall and continue right towards the ""is"" rule. Once I have ""is,"" I bring it back to the key.

Alternatively, I could move the ""is"" rule to the key's position directly, but it's seven steps to the right, which is a long way. Maybe it's better to create a shortcut.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the key into ""you,"" then I can control it. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, I could make the ball into ""win,"" but the ball is further down. The key is closer, so making the key the win condition seems better.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Move down to get the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move right three steps to the wall, place ""stop"" next to it, making it stoppable.
3. Move through the wall to the other side.
4. Continue moving right to reach the ""is"" rule at seven steps.
5. Pick up ""is"" and move it next to the key, which is one step left from the start.
6. Now, ""key is win"" is active. Move left to the key to win.

But wait, after step 3, I'm on the other side of the wall. Do I have a clear path to the ""is"" rule? Let me check the map again.

The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right. After moving through the wall at three steps right, I have four more steps to the right to reach ""is."" Are there any walls blocking that path? The map shows walls at four steps right and one step down, but I'm moving straight right, so maybe it's clear.

Alternatively, there might be walls at four steps right and other steps down, but I'm moving straight right, so perhaps I can pass.

Once I have ""is,"" I need to bring it back to the key. The key is one step left from the start, so I need to move left from ""is"" to get back. That's seven steps left, which might be tedious, but possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule on the way that makes movement easier, but I'm not sure.

Another consideration: after making ""key is win,"" I just need to move left to the key. But if the key is one step left, and I'm at the start, I can just move left. But I need to make sure that the key is reachable.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so it's adjacent to me. If I make ""key is win,"" then moving left would win the game immediately. That would be the quickest solution.

So, perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move down to get the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to the wall three steps right, making it stoppable.
3. Move right through the wall.
4. Move right to the ""is"" rule at seven steps.
5. Pick up ""is"" and move it next to the key at one step left.
6. Now, ""key is win"" is active. Move left to win.

But I'm not sure if I can move ""is"" back left after getting it. Let me think about the movement.

After step 4, I'm at seven steps right with the ""is"" rule. To get back to the key, I need to move left seven steps, which is possible but time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move faster or teleport, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule while holding it, so I don't need to go all the way back. Wait, in Baba Is You, when you pick up a rule, you can move it by moving yourself. So, after picking up ""is,"" I can move left while holding it, placing it next to the key.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move down to get ""stop.""
2. Move right three steps, place ""stop"" next to the wall, making it stoppable.
3. Move right through the wall.
4. Move right four more steps to reach ""is"" at seven steps.
5. Pick up ""is.""
6. Move left seven steps back to the starting position.
7. Place ""is"" next to the key, creating ""key is win.""
8. Move left to the key to win.

But moving seven steps left might take too long, and I might hit other walls or rules along the way. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule that allows me to move through walls without needing to stop them. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" I could move through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule mentioned, so that might not be possible.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is six steps right and six steps down. If I can make the ball into something useful, like a win condition, but it's further away. The key is closer, so focusing on the key seems better.

Another idea: if I can make the wall into ""you,"" then I can control the wall and move it out of the way. But that would require moving the ""wall"" rule next to ""is you,"" which might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, I could make the wall into ""stop,"" but that's already the case. Hmm.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps left and two steps down. If I can move it next to ""is stop,"" that would make all walls stoppable. But I'm not sure if that's necessary if I can just move the ""stop"" rule to individual walls.

I think the initial plan is still the best: use ""stop"" to make a wall passable, move to get ""is,"" and then make ""key is win.""

So, to execute this, I need to:

1. Move down to get ""stop.""
2. Move right three steps, place ""stop"" next to the wall, making it stoppable.
3. Move right through the wall.
4. Move right four steps to reach ""is.""
5. Pick up ""is.""
6. Move left seven steps back to the key.
7. Place ""is"" next to the key, making ""key is win.""
8. Move left to the key to win.

But I'm concerned about the time it takes to move back seven steps. Maybe there's a shortcut or a way to make the movement faster.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule on the way that allows me to move faster, but I don't see any rules that would enable that.

Another consideration: after making ""key is win,"" I just need to reach the key. Since the key is one step left, I can do that immediately after creating the rule. So, perhaps I don't need to move all the way back; instead, I can create the rule while moving towards the key.

Wait, no, because I need to have the ""is"" rule next to the key to create ""key is win."" So, I have to bring ""is"" back to the key's position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key next to ""is"" instead of moving ""is"" to the key. But the key is one step left, and ""is"" is seven steps right. That would require moving the key seven steps right, which might be difficult.

I think the best approach is to proceed with the initial plan, even if it takes more steps. So, I'll start by moving down to get the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key to the left and up, walls to the right and up, some rules like ""is"" and ""win"" further to the right and up. There's also a ""stop"" rule one step down. Walls are placed in various positions, and there's a ball two steps to the left and two steps down. There's a ""key"" rule six steps to the right and two steps down, and other rules like ""baba,"" ""is,"" ""you,"" and ""ball"" in different positions.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to reach the win condition. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The key is to the left and up, so maybe I need to get that key to unlock something. But first, I should check if there are any immediate obstacles.

The ""stop"" rule is one step down, which might block my movement if I go down. I should avoid that unless I can change the rules to make it passable. The walls are in the way to the right, so maybe I need to break through them or find another path.

I notice there's a ""wall"" rule two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that rule, I might be able to change the properties of walls. For example, if I make ""wall is push"" or something, I could push through them. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" they might not block me anymore.

The ball is two steps to the left and two steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something, like moving it into a rule to change it. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and two steps down. If I can get the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule.

Wait, the ""key"" object is to the left and up. Maybe I need to move there first. But to get to the key, I have to go left and up, but there's a wall to the right and up. Maybe I can go around or change the rules to make the walls passable.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and one step up. If I can move that, I can create new rules. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving ""baba"" and ""you"" to change who I am. But since ""baba is you"" is already active, I might not need that.

I think the key is to get the key first. So, I should move left and up to reach it. But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or the ""stop"" rule. Let me plan the path: move left, then up, then left again to get to the key.

Wait, the key is one step to the left and one step up from my current position. So, I can move left once and up once to reach it. But I need to check if there are any walls in that path. The wall is three steps to the right and one step up, so it's not blocking my way to the left and up. Okay, that seems safe.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to move a rule into place. For example, moving the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" to make ""key is something.""

But for now, I think the immediate step is to move left and up to get the key. That should help me progress towards the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" block, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rule blocks. The key is one step up, which might be important. There's a ""WIN"" rule 9 steps to the right and one step up. So, the win condition is probably at that position.

I also notice a ""stop"" rule one step to the right and one step down. That might mean that if I move there, I could get stuck or something. I should avoid that unless I have a reason to use it.

The ball is one step to the left and two steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of the puzzle. There's a ""key"" rule seven steps to the right and two steps down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something.

The walls are placed in a way that might block my path, but I can move through them if I change the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I could move them. But right now, I don't see any rule that allows me to push walls, so I might need to create that.

I also see a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and five steps down. Maybe I can use that to change what Baba is. If I can make ""baba is key"" or ""baba is win,"" that could help me reach the win condition.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the ""WIN"" block. To do that, I might need to move through the map, possibly picking up the key. But first, I should check if I can move towards the key or the win block.

The key is one step up, so I can move up to get it. But I need to make sure that moving up doesn't lead me into a wall or the ""stop"" rule. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: let's say I'm at (0,0).
- Key is at (0,1).
- Wall is at (4,1).
- ""WIN"" is at (9,1).
- ""stop"" is at (1, -1).
- Ball is at (-1, -2).
- ""key"" rule is at (7, -2).

So, moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) would get me the key. Then, I can move right towards the win block. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The walls are at (4,1), (4,-1), (4,-2), etc. So, moving right from (0,1) to (9,1) would require passing through (4,1), which is a wall. I can't move through walls unless I change the rules.

Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. The ""wall"" rule is at (-1, -2). If I can move that rule to say ""wall is push"" or ""wall is pass,"" I could move through them. But to do that, I need to move the rule block.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is key"" so that I can pick up the key and then use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at (7, -2). If I can move that to be next to the key, maybe I can make ""key is win"" or something. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the win block is at (9,1), which is far to the right, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to teleport or move faster. But I don't see any rule blocks that would allow that.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1, -5). If I can move that to say ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I need to get to that rule block.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move up to get the key at (0,1).
2. Then, move right towards the win block at (9,1), but I'll hit the wall at (4,1). So, I need to change the wall's property.
3. To change the wall's property, I need to move the ""wall"" rule at (-1, -2). Maybe I can move it to say ""wall is push"" or ""wall is pass.""
4. But to move the ""wall"" rule, I need to get to (-1, -2). That's two steps left and two steps down from my starting position. But I have to go up first to get the key, so maybe that's not the best path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is at (8,1). If I can move it to say ""wall is pass,"" that would help.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (8,1), which is near the win block. If I can move it to (4,1), making ""wall is pass,"" then I can move through the wall.

But how do I get to (8,1)? I need to move right 8 steps and up 1 step. That's a long way, and I might hit walls along the way.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to make ""baba is key"" so that I can pick up the key and then use it to unlock the win block. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1, -5). If I can move it to say ""baba is win,"" then I would win. But I need to get to (1, -5), which is one step right and five steps down. That might be possible after getting the key.

Wait, let me think again. The key is at (0,1). If I move up to get it, then I can move right. But the wall is at (4,1). So, I need to change the wall's property before I get to it.

Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule at (-1, -2) to (4,1), making ""wall is pass."" But to do that, I need to move the rule block, which requires moving it step by step.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule at (8,1) to (4,1), making ""wall is pass."" That might be easier because the ""is"" rule is closer to the win block.

So, here's the plan:

1. Move up to (0,1) to get the key.
2. Then, move right to (8,1) to get the ""is"" rule.
3. Then, move left to (4,1), placing the ""is"" rule there, making ""wall is pass.""
4. Now, I can move through the wall at (4,1) and continue right to (9,1) to win.

But wait, when I move the ""is"" rule to (4,1), it would create the rule ""wall is pass"" because the wall is at (4,1). That should make the wall passable.

So, the steps would be:

- Move up to (0,1) to get the key.
- Move right 8 steps to (8,1) to get the ""is"" rule.
- Move left 4 steps to (4,1), placing ""is"" next to the wall, creating ""wall is pass.""
- Now, move right from (4,1) to (9,1) to win.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""is"" rule to (4,1) doesn't interfere with anything else. Also, I need to ensure that I can move the rule block without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule at (-1, -2) to (4,1). That would also create ""wall is pass."" But moving the ""wall"" rule from (-1, -2) to (4,1) would require moving it right 5 steps and up 3 steps, which might be complicated.

I think moving the ""is"" rule is easier because it's closer. So, I'll proceed with that plan.

First, move up to get the key. Then, move right to get the ""is"" rule. Then, move left to place it next to the wall. Then, move right to win.

So, the first action is to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, walls, and some rules. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, and another wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a rule ""win"" 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Also, there's a rule ""stop"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, and a rule ""wall"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The key is nearby, so maybe I need to pick it up. But how?

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So if I move left once and up once, I can get the key. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, but that's not in my way. The wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down is also not blocking my path to the key.

So, my plan is to move left to get closer to the key. Let me try moving left once. That should bring me closer to the key. After that, I can move up to pick it up. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something or change a rule.

But wait, there's a rule ""stop"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I move right and down, I might trigger that rule, which could stop me. I need to avoid that. So, moving left and up seems safer.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to see if that helps. But the key is to the left and up, so moving left first makes more sense. Let me try that.

So, I'll choose to move left once. That should get me closer to the key without hitting any walls or triggering the stop rule. Once I'm next to the key, I can move up to pick it up. Then, I can see what other rules I can manipulate to reach the win condition.

I think moving left is the best first step. It gets me closer to the key without any immediate obstacles. After that, I can adjust my path based on the new observations.
