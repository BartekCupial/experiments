Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, but I need to figure out how to do that by manipulating the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball, a key, and several walls. The rules are spread out, so I can probably move some of them to create new rules or change existing ones. Let me list out the rules I see:

- ""is"" at various positions.
- ""win"" at 6 right, 4 up.
- ""wall"" at 4 left, 3 up.
- ""stop"" at 2 left, 3 up.
- ""ball"" at 2 right, 2 up.
- ""key"" at 6 right, 1 up.
- ""baba"" at 4 left, 2 down.
- ""you"" at 2 left, 2 down.

Hmm, so the ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 4 up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes what counts as winning. Alternatively, I can try to make the ball or key part of the win condition.

I notice there's a ball and a key. If I can make the ball or key the win condition, maybe I can reach it more easily. Let me think about how to do that.

First, I need to move some rule blocks. The ""is"" blocks are essential because they connect subjects and properties. I can try to move an ""is"" block next to ""win"" and another word to change the win condition.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at 2 right, 2 up. If I can move an ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" that might make ""ball is win."" Then, touching the ball would win the level.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to move it from its current position. Let me see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one at 5 right, 4 up, another at 1 left, 1 up, and another at 3 left, 2 down.

I think the closest ""is"" to the ""ball"" rule is the one at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move that ""is"" to be next to ""ball,"" then I can create ""ball is win.""

But wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me see where I am. The initial position isn't given, but I can assume I'm somewhere on the map. I need to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to an ""is"" and then next to ""win."" Let me plan the steps.

1. Move towards the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up. That's one step left and one up from my current position. So I need to move left once and up once.

Wait, but I can only take one action at a time. So first, I might move left, then up, but I need to choose one action now.

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the ""ball"" rule first. The ""ball"" rule is at 2 right, 2 up. So I need to move right twice and up twice. But that's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls.

Wait, looking at the walls, there are walls at various positions. For example, a wall is 1 step right and 4 up, which is where the ""is"" rule is. So maybe I can't go that way. Let me check the walls:

- wall at 1 right, 4 up
- wall at 1 right, 3 up
- wall at 1 right, 2 up
- wall at 1 right, 1 up
- wall at 1 right, 2 down
- etc.

So moving right might be blocked. Maybe I should move left first to get to the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up.

So, my first move should be to move left. That way, I can get closer to the ""is"" block and then move up to reach it.

Wait, but I'm not sure where I am. Let me try to visualize the map. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down, which might be where I start. So if I'm at 4 left, 2 down, moving left would take me further left, but maybe that's not the best path.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to get closer to the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up. Let me see: from my starting position, moving up would take me towards the ""is"" block.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the immediate next step. I need to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up. So, if I'm currently at a position where moving left once and up once would get me there, but I can only choose one action now.

So, perhaps the best first move is to move left, to get closer to the ""is"" block. That way, in the next step, I can move up to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first would be better. Let me see: if I move up, I might get closer to the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up.

Wait, perhaps I should move left first. Let me choose to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's mechanics in my favor.

First, I should note the positions of all the important elements. The ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far, so I might need to create a path or change the rules to make it easier to reach. The ""key"" is 2 steps to the left, which might be useful for opening something, but I don't see a lock mentioned, so maybe it's part of another rule.

The ""ball"" is 3 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break walls, but I'm not sure yet. There are also several ""is"" rules, which are essential because they define the properties of objects.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move an ""is"" block next to another word, I can redefine something. The ""baba"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move ""baba"" or ""you"" next to another word, I might change what Baba is or what ""you"" represents.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that, I might make something stop moving or become immovable, which could block paths or create barriers.

The ""wall"" rules are in various places. If I can redefine walls, maybe I can make them passable or turn them into something else, like ""WIN"" or ""YOU.""

The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can make the key into something else, like ""WIN,"" then maybe picking it up would win the level.

I should also consider the ball. If I can make the ball into ""WIN,"" then hitting it would win the game. Alternatively, if I can make the ball into ""YOU,"" I could control it and use it to reach the win condition.

Looking at the positions, the ball is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and another word, I could redefine it. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" would make ""ball is win,"" so touching the ball would win the game.

But how do I get to the ball? There are walls in the way. Maybe I can move some walls or redefine them. The walls are at various positions, so if I can make a wall into ""STOP,"" I can block movement, but that might not help. Alternatively, making a wall into ""YOU"" would let me move through it, but I don't see a way to do that immediately.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to ""you,"" I could make myself stop, which isn't helpful.

Another idea: the ""key"" is 2 steps to the left. If I can make the key into ""WIN,"" then picking it up would win the game. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" But the ""win"" rule is far away, so that might be difficult.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into ""WIN."" The ball is 3 steps up, and the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to ""win,"" I can create ""ball is win."" But I need to get the ""win"" rule closer.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can bring it closer by moving other rules. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes something else into ""WIN.""

Let me think about the steps I can take. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to plan a path to get to a position where I can move an ""is"" rule next to another word to create a new rule.

Looking at the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, that's close to me. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ball, which is 3 steps up, I can create ""ball is something."" But I need to figure out what to make it.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" But the ""key"" is 2 steps to the left, and the ""win"" is far to the right. That might not be feasible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" and ""you"" to change what Baba is. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and maybe use it to open something or redefine it.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the ball is 3 steps up. There are walls around, so I might need to go around them.

If I move up three times, I can reach the ball. But are there walls blocking me? Let me check the walls. There are walls at 2 steps right and 4 up, 2 right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, 2 right and 1 up, 2 right, 2 right and 1 down, 2 right and 2 down. So, moving up from my position, I might hit a wall.

Wait, the wall is 2 steps to the right and 4 up, which is above me. So if I move up, I might not hit a wall immediately. Let me try to move up three times to reach the ball.

But before I do that, I should check if there's a better way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and another word to redefine it. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win the game.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is far away. Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and another word, like ""you,"" making ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball.

Wait, if I make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes me, and I can move it. But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, making ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition.

Let me try to plan the steps. I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up, and the ball is 3 steps up. So I can move up once to reach the ""is"" rule, then move it up two more times to reach the ball. But I can only move objects that are not ""stop"" or similar. Since the ""is"" rule is a text block, I can move it.

So, first, I move up to get to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it up two more times to place it next to the ball. Then, I need to move another word next to it to complete the rule. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" and the ball, I can make ""ball is win.""

But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe I can instead move the ""win"" rule closer. Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and another word that's closer.

Wait, the ""key"" is 2 steps to the left. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""key,"" I can make ""ball is key."" Then, the ball would become a key, which might not help directly, but maybe I can then use it to open something.

Alternatively, I can make ""ball is stop,"" which would make the ball immovable, but that might not help.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to make the ball into ""WIN."" So, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. But since the ""win"" rule is far, maybe I can bring it closer by moving other rules.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and another word that's closer, like ""you."" So, ""ball is you"" would make the ball controllable, and then I can move it to the ""win"" position.

Wait, if I make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. Then, I can move the ball to the ""win"" position, which is 7 steps to the right and 4 up. That might be a way to reach the win condition.

So, the plan is:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule (1 step up).
2. Move the ""is"" rule up two more times to place it next to the ball (3 steps up total).
3. Then, move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" and the ball to create ""ball is you.""

But where is the ""you"" rule? It's 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. That's below me. So, after placing the ""is"" next to the ball, I need to move the ""you"" rule up to join them.

Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to the ""is"" and ball position.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then move the ""win"" rule next to them, but that's too far.

Wait, maybe I can make the ball into ""WIN"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. But since the ""win"" rule is far, maybe I can bring it closer by moving other rules.

Alternatively, I can make the ball into ""YOU,"" so I can control it, and then move it to the ""win"" position.

Let me try to outline the steps:

- Move up to the ""is"" rule (1 step up).
- Move the ""is"" rule up two more times to place it next to the ball (total 3 steps up).
- Now, the ""is"" is next to the ball. I need to add another word to complete the rule. The closest word is ""ball,"" but I need another word to make ""ball is something.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" and ball. But the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 4 up, which is far. Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" rule up to join them.

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, to get it to the ball's position, I need to move it up 5 steps and right 3 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ""baba"" into something else. The ""baba"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and another word, I can redefine Baba.

For example, making ""baba is key"" would let me pick up the key, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, making ""baba is win"" would make Baba the win condition, so I just need to be myself to win, but that might not be the case.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. If I make ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win condition, so I would win immediately. But I don't think that's how it works because the win condition is usually an object you need to reach.

Wait, no, if ""baba is win,"" then being Baba would mean I am the win condition, so the game would end when I am present, which I already am. So that might not work.

Alternatively, making ""baba is stop"" would make me immovable, which is bad.

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to make the ball into ""WIN."" So, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. But since the ""win"" rule is far, maybe I can bring it closer.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and another word that's closer, like ""you,"" making ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball and move it to the ""win"" position.

So, let's try that:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule (1 step up).
2. Move the ""is"" rule up two more times to place it next to the ball (total 3 steps up).
3. Now, the ""is"" is next to the ball. I need to add ""you"" to make ""ball is you.""
4. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, I need to move it up 5 steps and right 3 steps to place it next to the ""is"" and ball.

But that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if I can do that without getting blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to the ""is"" and ball position. Let me see:

- The ""you"" rule is at (left 1, down 2). To get it to the ball's position (up 3), I need to move it up 5 steps and right 3 steps. That's a lot, but perhaps possible if there's a path.

Wait, but moving the ""you"" rule would require me to move it step by step, and I might hit walls along the way. Let me check the walls:

- Walls are at (right 2, up 4), (right 2, up 3), (right 2, up 2), (right 2, up 1), (right 2), (right 2, down 1), (right 2, down 2).

So, moving the ""you"" rule to the right 3 steps would take it to (right 1, down 2), then (right 2, down 2), which is a wall. So, I can't move it past that.

Hmm, maybe that's not feasible. Alternatively, I can try to make the ""key"" into ""WIN."" The ""key"" is 2 steps to the left. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is far, so maybe I can bring it closer.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" and ""is."" But the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 4 up, which is too far.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by moving other rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" and ""is,"" I can make ""key is win.""

But that would require moving the ""win"" rule 7 steps left and 3 steps down, which is a lot and might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and another word. For example, making ""key is you,"" so I can pick it up and maybe use it to redefine something else.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think differently.

What if I make the ""stop"" rule into something else? The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and another word, I can redefine it.

For example, making ""stop is win"" would make the stop block the win condition, which might not help. Alternatively, making ""stop is you"" would make the stop block controllable, but that's probably not useful.

Wait, maybe I can make the ""stop"" rule into ""YOU,"" so I can move through it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can make the ""stop"" rule into ""WIN,"" so stepping on it would win the game. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for the ""key"" rule, which is 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can make the key into ""WIN,"" then picking it up would win the game.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and the ""win"" rule. But again, the ""win"" rule is far. Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and another word that's closer, like ""you,"" making ""key is you,"" so I can pick it up and maybe use it to redefine something else.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think about the ball again. If I can make the ball into ""WIN,"" then hitting it would win the game. So, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make the ball into ""YOU,"" so I can control it and move it to the ""win"" position.

Wait, if I make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. Then, I can move the ball to the ""win"" position, which is 7 steps to the right and 4 up. That might be a way to reach the win condition.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule (1 step up).
2. Move the ""is"" rule up two more times to place it next to the ball (total 3 steps up).
3. Now, the ""is"" is next to the ball. I need to add ""you"" to make ""ball is you.""
4. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, I need to move it up","

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is usually to reach the win condition, but I need to see what's on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall two steps to the right and four up. Then there are several rule blocks: ""is"" at six right and four up, ""win"" at seven right and four up, ""wall"" at three left and three up, ""stop"" at one left and three up, and so on. There's also a ball three steps up, and a key two steps to the left.

Hmm, the key is two steps left, which might be important. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. But first, I should check if I can move any rule blocks to change the rules.

I see a ""ball"" rule three steps right and two up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the ball do something else. Also, there's a ""key"" rule seven right and one up. Maybe if I can move the key or the rule, I can change what the key does.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one left and three up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or become immovable. But I'm not sure yet.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I might be able to make ""baba is win"" or something like that, which would let me win immediately.

But how do I get there? I need to move towards the rule blocks. Let me see the path. The walls are in the way, but maybe I can go around. The key is two steps left, so I can move left twice to get it. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or something else.

Wait, but I don't see a door mentioned. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule. For example, if I have the key, I can move the ""key"" rule block to make a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would let me win by picking up the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" so I can pick up the key and then use it to change another rule.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move left twice to get the key. Then, I can see if I can move any rule blocks. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make a new rule.

But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me check the positions again. The key is two steps to the left, so I can move left twice to get it. Then, I can see if I can move any rule blocks.

Once I have the key, I can try to move the ""key"" rule block. If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""key is win,"" which would mean picking up the key would win the level.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is key"" so I can pick up the key and then use it to change another rule.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""stop"" rule is one left and three up, so if I can move that, I can make something stop. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" That would let me win immediately. But how do I get there? The ""win"" rule is seven right and four up, which is pretty far.

Alternatively, I can make ""ball is win"" by moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" Then, when I hit the ball, I win.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The key is two steps left, so I can get it quickly. Once I have the key, I can use it to move rule blocks. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is win.""

So, my plan is: move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the rule blocks, and then rearrange them to make a new rule that lets me win.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""stop"" rule is one left and three up, so if I can move that, I can make something stop. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is key"" so I can pick up the key and then use it to change another rule.

Wait, but I already have the key. Maybe I can just move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is win.""

So, let me try that. I'll move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the ""key"" rule block, and then move it next to ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then, when I pick up the key, I win.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""key"" rule is seven right and one up, so I need to get there. But that's far. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" But that's also far.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is win"" by moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" Then, when I hit the ball, I win.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The key is two steps left, so I can get it quickly. Once I have the key, I can use it to move rule blocks.

So, I'll move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the rule blocks, and then rearrange them to make a new rule that lets me win.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""stop"" rule is one left and three up, so if I can move that, I can make something stop. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is key"" so I can pick up the key and then use it to change another rule.

Wait, but I already have the key. Maybe I can just move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is win.""

So, let me try that. I'll move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the ""key"" rule block, and then move it next to ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then, when I pick up the key, I win.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""key"" rule is seven right and one up, so I need to get there. But that's far. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" But that's also far.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is win"" by moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" Then, when I hit the ball, I win.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The key is two steps left, so I can get it quickly. Once I have the key, I can use it to move rule blocks.

So, I'll move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the rule blocks, and then rearrange them to make a new rule that lets me win.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""stop"" rule is one left and three up, so if I can move that, I can make something stop. But I'm not sure yet.

So, let me try that. I'll move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the ""key"" rule block, and then move it next to ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Then, when I pick up the key, I win.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. The ""key"" rule is seven right and one up, so I need to get there. But that's far. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" But that's also far.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is win"" by moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" Then, when I hit the ball, I win.

So, I'll move left twice to get the key, then move up to get near the rule blocks, and then rearrange them to make a new rule that lets me win.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the ""WIN"" rule. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. It's 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far, so I might need to move some rules to create a path or change the win condition.

I also notice a ""key"" object two steps to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. The ball is three steps up, which might be part of a puzzle involving movement or breaking walls.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I can move these to create new rules. For example, if I move ""ball"" next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I could make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. That might help me reach higher places or break through walls.

Alternatively, I could try to change the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then maybe picking up the key would end the level. That could be a quicker way to win without having to reach the far ""WIN"" object.

I should also consider the ""stop"" rule. If I can make something ""stop,"" it might block certain paths or prevent me from moving through walls. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Another idea is to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I could walk through walls, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Maybe I can create it by rearranging existing rules.

Wait, I see a ""rule `stop`"" which is one step to the left and three steps up. If I move that near a wall, maybe I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Let me think about the ball again. If I can control the ball, maybe I can use it to break through walls or reach higher areas. So, moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""ball is you"" seems like a good plan.

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule. It's currently three steps to the right and two steps up. I need to get it next to the ""is"" rule, which is one step up. So, I should move the ""ball"" rule left a couple of steps to align it with ""is"" and ""you.""

But how do I move the ""ball"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked by walls or other rules. I need to check the path. The ""ball"" rule is at (3,2), and the ""is"" rule is at (0,1). So, I need to move left three steps and down one step. But there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""ball"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at (0,1), and the ""ball"" is at (3,2). If I move the ""is"" rule right three steps and up one step, it would be next to the ""ball"" rule. But I'm not sure if that's possible without moving through walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's at (0,1) up to (0,2), then right to (3,2) to be next to the ""ball"" rule. That way, I can create ""ball is you."" But I need to make sure there's a clear path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to be next to the ""ball"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1, -2). If I move it up to (3,2), that would make ""ball is you."" But moving the ""you"" rule that far might be complicated.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to move the ""ball"" rule closer. Let me see the positions again. The ""ball"" rule is at (3,2), and the ""is"" rule is at (0,1). If I can move the ""ball"" rule left three steps to (0,2), then I can move the ""is"" rule up to (0,2) to make ""ball is you.""

But I need to check if there are any walls blocking the path. The walls are at various positions, but I think the area around (0,2) is clear. So, moving the ""ball"" rule left three steps would be possible.

Wait, but moving the ""ball"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it. Since I'm Baba, and I can move around, I can approach the ""ball"" rule and then move it. So, I should move towards the ""ball"" rule.

Let me plan my steps. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is near the ""baba"" rule. I need to move right three steps and up two steps to reach the ""ball"" rule. But I have to avoid walls.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), and (2,-2). So, moving along the right side might be blocked. Maybe I should move up first to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, I can move up three steps to get to (0,3), then right three steps to (3,3), but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe a better path is to move right two steps to (2,0), then up two steps to (2,2), but there's a wall there. So, that's blocked.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. Let me try moving up three steps to (0,3), then right three steps to (3,3), but I don't see a wall there. Then, I can move down to (3,2) where the ""ball"" rule is. That seems possible.

Once I'm at (3,2), I can move the ""ball"" rule left three steps to (0,2). Then, I can move the ""is"" rule from (0,1) up to (0,2), making ""ball is you."" Now, I can control the ball.

After that, I can move the ball towards the ""WIN"" rule. The ""WIN"" rule is at (7,4), which is far to the right and up. I might need to break through walls or find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to something closer. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would end the level. The key is two steps to the left, at (-2,0). So, if I can make ""key is win,"" then I just need to pick up the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is at (7,1). The ""is"" rule is at (0,1), and the ""win"" rule is at (7,4). So, moving the ""key"" rule up three steps to (7,4) would make ""key is win."" But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to (7,1) where the ""key"" rule is, making ""key is win."" That might be easier. But I need to move the ""win"" rule, which is at (7,4). I can move it down three steps to (7,1).

But moving the ""win"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it. So, I need to get to (7,4), which is far. Maybe after controlling the ball, I can use it to reach there.

Wait, maybe I can first change the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then I just need to pick up the key. So, let's try that.

I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is at (7,1). The ""is"" rule is at (0,1), and the ""win"" rule is at (7,4). So, if I move the ""is"" rule to (7,1), then I can have ""key is win.""

But moving the ""is"" rule from (0,1) to (7,1) requires moving it right seven steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible if there's a clear path.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to (7,1), making ""key is win."" That would be moving it down three steps. But I need to check if the path is clear.

I think the path from (7,4) to (7,1) is clear, so I can move the ""win"" rule down three steps. Then, the rule becomes ""key is win,"" and picking up the key would end the level.

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. So, I need to get to (7,4), which is far. Maybe after controlling the ball, I can reach there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up to (7,4), making ""key is win."" That would require moving the ""key"" rule up three steps. But again, I need to be adjacent to it.

I think the best approach is to first make ""ball is you"" so I can move the ball and reach further areas. Then, use the ball to move the ""win"" rule or ""key"" rule to change the win condition.

So, my first step is to move towards the ""ball"" rule. I'll move up three steps to (0,3), then right three steps to (3,3), then down one step to (3,2) where the ""ball"" rule is. Then, I'll move the ""ball"" rule left three steps to (0,2). Next, I'll move the ""is"" rule from (0,1) up to (0,2), creating ""ball is you.""

Now, I can control the ball. I'll move the ball right to (1,2), then up to (1,3), and so on, to reach the ""win"" rule or the ""key"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to (7,1) to make ""key is win."" But I need to get there, which might take some time.

Wait, maybe I can just move the ""key"" rule up to (7,4) to make ""key is win."" That way, when I pick up the key, I win. The key is at (-2,0), so I need to move it to (7,4). That's a long move, but if I can control the ball, I can push it there.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so I just need to reach the current position. But that might not be necessary.

I think the most straightforward path is to make ""ball is you,"" then use the ball to move the ""win"" rule or ""key"" rule to change the win condition.

So, my first action is to move up to get closer to the ""ball"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the usual ""is"" and ""you"" rules. The key is two steps to the left and one step down. The ""win"" rule is seven steps to the right and three steps up. There's also a ""ball"" rule three steps to the right and one step up.

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. So, maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the game easier. For example, if I can make the ball or the key into something useful, like a tool to break walls or change the win condition.

First, I should figure out where I am. The observation says I'm at a certain position, but I'm not exactly sure. I think I'm near the bottom since the key is two steps to the left and one down from me. Maybe I should move towards the key first because keys often unlock things.

But wait, the key is two steps to the left and one down. If I move left twice and down once, I can pick it up. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking me. Looking at the objects, there are walls two steps to the right and three steps down, so maybe the path to the key is clear.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps the key is part of a rule. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right, so maybe if I move the key there, I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something.

Alternatively, the ball is two steps up. Maybe I can move the ball to change the rules. If I can make the ball into a tool, like ""ball is push,"" then I can push walls or other objects.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The ""is"" rule is six steps to the right and three up, and ""win"" is seven steps to the right and three up. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules, I can create new rules.

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is you,"" which would mean I win when I reach myself, which doesn't make sense. Or maybe ""win is key,"" so the key becomes the win condition.

Wait, the key is two steps left and one down. If I can move the ""key"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, I can make ""key is win."" That way, picking up the key would make me win.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to move the ""key"" text block. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. So I need to get there, but that's far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule to make ""key is something.""

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a tool. The ""ball"" rule is three steps right and one up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is,"" I can make ""ball is push,"" allowing me to push objects.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at a certain position, and the key is nearby. Maybe I should first move towards the key.

So, from my current position, I need to move left twice and down once to reach the key. Let me check if that's possible. Are there walls blocking me? The walls are two steps right and three down, so maybe the path is clear.

If I move left twice and down once, I can pick up the key. Then, I can use the key to change a rule. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, making ""key is win."" That way, when I pick up the key, I win.

But I need to make sure I can move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. So after picking up the key, I need to move it to the ""win"" position, which is seven steps right and three up. That seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a tool. The ""ball"" rule is three steps right and one up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is,"" I can make ""ball is push."" Then, I can push walls or other objects.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think again. The key is nearby, so maybe I should prioritize getting it. Once I have the key, I can use it to change the win condition.

So, my plan is: move left twice and down once to get the key. Then, move the ""key"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, making ""key is win."" That way, when I pick up the key, I win.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. So after getting the key, I need to move it there. That might take some time, but it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a tool to help me move the key. But I'm not sure. Let me try to move towards the key first.

So, from my current position, I need to move left twice and down once. Let me check the path. Are there walls blocking me? The walls are two steps right and three down, so maybe the path to the key is clear.

If I move left twice and down once, I can pick up the key. Then, I can use the key to change the win condition.

Wait, but the key is two steps left and one down. So, if I move left twice and down once, I'll be at the key's position. Then, I can pick it up.

Once I have the key, I can move it to the ""win"" rule's position, which is seven steps right and three up. That would make ""key is win,"" so when I pick up the key, I win.

But I need to make sure I can move the key there. It might require moving through other objects, but I think it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a tool to help me push the key or other objects. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the best course of action is to move towards the key first. So, I'll move left twice and down once to pick it up. Then, I can use it to change the win condition.

But wait, the key is two steps left and one down. So, from my current position, I need to move left twice and down once. Let me check the path again. Are there walls in the way? The walls are two steps right and three down, so I think the path is clear.

So, I'll move left twice and down once to get the key. Then, I can use it to change the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move the key to the ""win"" rule's position. That might require moving it seven steps right and three up, which is a bit far, but I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a tool to help me move the key more easily. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the key is the priority here. So, I'll move towards it first.

So, my first action is to move left twice and down once. But since the assistant can only choose one action at a time, I need to decide which direction to move first.

Looking at the options, I can choose left, right, up, down, or idle. So, to move left twice and down once, I need to choose left first.

Wait, but the key is two steps left and one down. So, from my current position, I need to move left twice and down once. But I can only choose one action at a time. So, I'll choose left first.

But wait, the key is two steps left and one down. So, if I move left once, I'll be one step closer. Then, I can move left again, and then down.

But the assistant can only choose one action per turn, so I need to plan accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first to get closer to the key. But the key is one step down and two steps left. So, moving down first would bring me closer vertically.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the exact positions.

The key is two steps to the left and one step down from me. So, if I move left once, I'm one step closer horizontally. Then, moving left again would bring me to the key's column. Then, moving down once would bring me to the key.

Alternatively, moving down once first would bring me one step closer vertically, but I still need to move left twice.

I think moving left first is better because the key is two steps left and one down. So, moving left twice and then down once would get me there.

But since I can only choose one action at a time, I'll start by moving left.

Wait, but the key is two steps left and one down. So, moving left once would bring me to the position one step left and same row. Then, moving left again would bring me to the key's column, but I still need to move down once.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first to get closer vertically, but I'm not sure.

I think the best first move is to move left once, bringing me closer to the key.

So, my chosen action is left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""win"" rule located 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That seems pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier. There's also a ""ball"" object near me, which might be useful. The ""key"" is somewhere else, but I'm not sure if I need it yet.

I notice there are several walls and rule blocks. The walls are placed in various positions, some to the right and up, which might block my path. The rule blocks include ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move a ""stop"" rule onto a wall to make it passable. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that changes the properties of the walls or other objects.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. I need to figure out which direction will help me progress. If I move up, I might get closer to the ""win"" rule, but there are walls in the way. Moving right could help me reach the ""ball"" or other rule blocks. Moving down or left might not be as helpful right now.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. If I can get the ball to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball the win condition, which might be easier to reach. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer to me by manipulating the rules.

Another idea: if I can make myself into a ball, I might be able to roll through walls or other obstacles. To do that, I'd need to create a rule like ""baba is ball."" But to do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule block next to the ""is"" rule block and the ""baba"" rule block.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that next to an ""is"" rule and the ""baba"" rule, I can create ""baba is ball."" That would change my properties to that of a ball, which might help me move differently or interact with the environment in a new way.

So, my plan is to move towards the ""ball"" rule block. I need to get to it without hitting any walls. Let me check the path. Moving right from my current position, I can go towards the ""ball."" There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, but maybe I can go around it.

Alternatively, if I move up first, I might find a clearer path. Let me try moving up to see if that opens up any opportunities. If I move up, I can check if there are any rule blocks I can use to my advantage.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 2 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to make a wall passable. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. My main goal is to get to the ""ball"" rule to change my properties.

So, I think the best move is to go right to get closer to the ""ball"" rule. That way, I can start setting up the new rule to become a ball and potentially reach the win condition more easily.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's mechanics in my favor.

First, I should note the positions of all the important elements. The ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far, so I might need to create a path or change the rules to make it easier to reach. The ""key"" is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet.

There's a ""ball"" 2 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break walls, so that might be useful. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up, which probably makes walls immovable. If I can change that, maybe I can move walls to create a path.

The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move this rule, I might be able to make walls passable or change their properties. The ""is"" rules are scattered, which means they can be rearranged to form new rules.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules. If I can move these around, I can combine them with other words to make new rules that could help me win.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm trying to reach the win condition, I need to figure out the shortest path or a way to manipulate the rules to make the win easier.

If I move right, I might be heading towards the ""win"" rule, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through them if I change the rules. Alternatively, moving up could help me reach the ""ball"" or other rules that can be manipulated.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 2 steps up. If I can get the ball, maybe I can use it to push a wall or break it. But to get the ball, I need to move up, but there might be walls blocking me. Let me check the map again.

The walls are positioned in such a way that they might be blocking my path. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can make the walls movable. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls won't stop me anymore. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""wall is push,"" I can push them aside.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""wall"" rules next to each other with another word like ""push."" Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's an ""is"" rule 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, another 1 step up, and others in different positions. If I can move one of these ""is"" rules next to the ""wall"" rule, I can form a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to make myself into something else, like a ""key"" or ""win,"" but that might complicate things.

Another idea: if I can make the ""key"" into ""you,"" I can pick it up and maybe unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned, so that might not be necessary.

Wait, the ""key"" is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move left, I can reach it, but there might be walls blocking that path. Let me check the walls' positions again.

The walls are 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up, etc. It seems like the walls are on the right side, so moving left might be clearer. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make the key into something else, like ""win,"" so that picking up the key would win the level. That could be a clever way to solve it without moving much.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is quite far. Maybe it's better to bring the ""key"" closer.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think again.

If I move up to get the ball, I can use it to break walls or push them. Once I have the ball, I can move it into walls to break them, creating a path towards the win.

So, my plan is:

1. Move up to reach the ball.
2. Use the ball to break or push walls blocking the path to the win.
3. Once the path is clear, move towards the win.

But wait, can I move the ball? Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push the ball if it's adjacent. Let me check the ball's position: it's 2 steps up. So, if I move up twice, I can reach it.

But are there walls in the way? The walls are 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so moving up from my current position might not be blocked. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming I'm at the starting position, moving up twice would take me to the ball's location. Then, I can push the ball down or in another direction to break walls.

Alternatively, if I can't move the ball, maybe I can create a rule that makes the ball pushable or breakable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them. That might be a better approach.

So, another plan:

1. Move left to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule away, making walls passable.
3. Move through the walls to reach the win.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to have ""baba is you"" and then move the rule. Since I control Baba, I can move to the ""stop"" rule's position and then move it elsewhere.

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, you can only move objects, not rules directly. Rules are made of text blocks that you can move to create or change rules. So, to change the ""stop"" rule, I need to move the ""stop"" text block.

Looking back, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So, if I move left and up, I can reach the ""stop"" text block. Then, I can move it to a different location, effectively changing the rule.

If I move the ""stop"" text block next to another word, like ""wall,"" I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, moving it away would remove the ""stop"" rule, making walls passable.

Wait, no. The ""stop"" rule is ""wall is stop,"" which makes walls immovable. If I remove the ""stop"" rule, walls would no longer be stopped, meaning I can move through them. So, moving the ""stop"" text block away would deactivate that rule.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left and up to reach the ""stop"" text block.
2. Move the ""stop"" text block to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, walls are passable, so I can move through them to reach the win.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" text block doesn't create a new rule that's harmful. For example, if I move it next to another word, it might create a new rule I don't want.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" text block to an empty space, effectively removing it from the rule set.

So, let's try that.

First, I need to move to the ""stop"" text block's position, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up from my current position. So, I should move left once and up twice.

Wait, no. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So, from my current position, I need to move left once and up twice to reach it.

But I'm not sure about the exact grid, so I'll assume that moving left and up will get me there.

Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""stop"" text block and move it somewhere else, like far away, so it doesn't form any rules.

After that, the walls won't be stopped, and I can move through them.

Once the walls are passable, I can move towards the win, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's a long way, but if the walls are passable, I can go straight there.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path once the walls are passable.

Another consideration: the ""key"" is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can reach the key, maybe it can help me in some way, like unlocking a door or changing the win condition.

But without seeing a door, I'm not sure. Maybe the key is not necessary if I can just move through walls.

So, to summarize, my plan is:

1. Move left and up to reach the ""stop"" text block.
2. Move the ""stop"" text block to a different location to deactivate the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. With walls passable, move towards the win.

Now, let's think about the specific actions.

First, I need to move left once and up twice to reach the ""stop"" text block. So, the actions would be:

1. left
2. up
3. up

But I need to make sure that the path is clear. If there are walls in the way, I might need to adjust.

Wait, if the walls are still stopping me, I can't move through them yet. So, I need to find a path that doesn't require moving through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to reach the ball, then use the ball to break walls.

But I'm not sure if the ball can break walls. In Baba Is You, the ball can push objects if they are pushable. So, if I can make walls pushable, I can use the ball to move them.

To make walls pushable, I need to create a rule like ""wall is push."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""push"" text blocks next to the ""wall"" text block.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step up"" and others. So, I can move an ""is"" text block next to the ""wall"" text block and a ""push"" text block if available.

Wait, I don't see a ""push"" text block mentioned. So, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, I can use the ball to break walls if I can make them breakable.

Another idea: if I can make the ball into a ""bomb"" or something that can break walls, but I don't see a ""bomb"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make the ball into ""you,"" so I can control it, but that might not help.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""baba"" text block next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can change who I am. But I'm already ""baba is you,"" so that might not help.

Alternatively, I can make the ball into ""you,"" so I can control it. To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" text block next to ""is"" and ""you.""

The ""ball"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, if I can move the ""ball"" text block next to an ""is"" and ""you,"" I can create ""ball is you,"" making the ball controllable.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think again.

Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""stop"" text block to deactivate the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.

So, I'll proceed with that plan.

First, I need to move to the ""stop"" text block's position, which is 1 step left and 2 steps up.

So, my first action should be to move left.

After moving left, I'll be one step left. Then, I need to move up twice to reach the ""stop"" text block.

Once there, I can pick up the ""stop"" text block and move it somewhere else, like far to the right or down, to deactivate the rule.

After that, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the win.

So, the actions would be:

1. left
2. up
3. up
4. right (to move the ""stop"" text block away)

But I need to make sure that after moving the ""stop"" text block, it doesn't form a new rule with other text blocks.

Alternatively, I can move it to an empty space.

Once the ""stop"" rule is deactivated, I can move freely through walls.

Then, I can move towards the win, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up.

But that's a long path. Maybe there's a shorter way once walls are passable.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule to make the win condition closer.

But that might be more complicated.

So, to recap, my plan is:

- Move left to reach the ""stop"" text block.
- Move up twice to get to it.
- Move the ""stop"" text block away to deactivate the rule.
- Move through walls to reach the win.

Now, let's think about the specific actions step by step.

First, I need to move left once.

Then, up twice.

Then, move the ""stop"" text block to a new location.

But in the game, moving a text block is done by moving into it and then moving it in a direction.

So, after reaching the ""stop"" text block, I can move it, for example, to the right.

So, the actions would be:

1. left
2. up
3. up
4. right (to move the ""stop"" text block)

After that, the ""stop"" rule is deactivated, and walls are passable.

Then, I can move towards the win.

But I need to make sure that the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make the win condition closer.

But that might require more steps.

So, I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" text block away to make walls passable, then move through them to reach the win.

Therefore, my first action should be to move left to start heading towards the ""stop"" text block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The rules are defined by text blocks like ""rule `is`"" or ""rule `win`."" These can be moved to create or change rules, which can alter the game mechanics.

First, I need to figure out where everything is. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. The ""key"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. The ""ball"" is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. There are also several walls around, which might block my path unless I can move them or change their properties.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't pass through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to make walls passable or to change what counts as a wall. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is pass,"" that might help me navigate.

I also notice there's a ""stop"" rule 2 steps up. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can stop certain objects or myself, but I'm not sure how that would help yet.

The key is nearby, 1 step left and 1 step down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I don't see a lock mentioned. Perhaps the key is part of a rule that I can use to change something else.

The ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball in some way, like pushing it to trigger a rule change or to reach a higher area.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first since it's close. If I can pick up the key, maybe it will help me unlock a path or change a rule. So, I'll move left and down to get the key.

After getting the key, I can look around for any rule blocks that might be useful. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key to create a new rule like ""key is you"" or ""key is win."" That could change the win condition or give me new abilities.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule involving the ball, which might help me move other objects or change the environment.

I also need to be careful with the walls. If I can't move through them, I might get stuck. So, perhaps I should look for a way to make walls passable or to remove them by changing their rules.

Another thought: if I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately by being myself. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is far to the right. Maybe I need to create a path to it by moving walls or changing their properties. If I can make some walls into ""pass"" or ""push,"" I can clear a path.

Let me plan my steps:

1. Move left and down to pick up the key.
2. Once I have the key, look for rule blocks to create a new rule involving the key.
3. Maybe create ""key is win"" to change the win condition to the key's location.
4. Alternatively, use the key to unlock a rule that allows me to move walls or change their properties.

But I'm not sure if the key can be used to change rules directly. Maybe I need to move the key next to a rule block to form a new rule.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball to create ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball and possibly use it to move other objects.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the map. The key is to the left and down, so I need to move in that direction. Once I get the key, I can see what options I have.

I think the best first move is to go left and down to get the key. That way, I can have the key in my possession and see if it can be used to change any rules or unlock something.

So, I'll choose the ""left"" action to start moving towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's mechanics in my favor.

First, I should note the positions of all the important elements. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far, so I might need to create a path or change the rules to make it easier to reach. The ""key"" is just 1 step down, which is close. The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There are also several ""is"" rules scattered around, which I can use to create new rules by moving them next to other objects.

I notice that there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make that apply to something, it might block certain objects. But I'm not sure yet how that helps.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that next to a wall object, I can make walls stop me, but I already have walls in the way, so maybe that's not immediately useful.

The ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can make the ball have some property, maybe making it pushable or something else.

The ""key"" is 1 step down, which is close. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. But I don't see a lock in the current setup, so perhaps the key is part of a rule I need to create.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to these, I can create new rules like ""baba is something"" or ""you is something.""

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that next to the ""baba"" or ""you"" rules, I can create new rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule, I can make ""baba is [something]."" But I need to see what's next to it.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win object, which is much closer.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move towards the ""is"" rule at 2 steps right and 1 step up. I need to get there to use it.

2. Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up and move it next to the ""key"" rule, which is 1 step down. That would create the rule ""key is win,"" making the key the new win condition.

3. Then, I can go down to the key and win the level.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" rule. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, so I can move the ""is"" rule by moving Baba next to it and then moving it.

Let me check the path. I'm currently at the starting position. To get to the ""is"" rule at 2 right and 1 up, I need to move right twice and up once. But I have walls in the way. Let me see the walls:

- wall 4 steps right and 3 up
- wall 4 steps right and 2 up
- wall 4 steps right and 1 up
- wall 4 steps right
- wall 4 steps right and 1 down
- wall 4 steps right and 2 down
- wall 4 steps right and 3 down

So, the walls are on the right side, but I'm starting from the left. I need to navigate around them. Maybe I can go up first to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push them aside. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, making ""wall is stop"" would make them block movement, but that's the default.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step right and 2 up. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but they already do. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is wall,"" then I can become a wall, but that might not help.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on changing the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then I can just go to the key and win without dealing with the walls.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" is 1 step down, and the ""is"" rule is 2 right and 1 up. So, I need to get the ""is"" rule to the position of the key.

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule. Since I'm Baba, I can move it by moving next to it and then moving it in a direction.

Let me plan the movements:

1. Move right twice and up once to reach the ""is"" rule.

But wait, are there walls blocking that path? Let me check:

- Starting position: let's assume it's at (0,0).

- Moving right twice would take me to (2,0).

- Then up once to (2,1), which is where the ""is"" rule is.

But are there walls at (2,0) or (2,1)? Looking back at the objects:

- wall 4 steps right and 3 up: (4,3)

- wall 4 steps right and 2 up: (4,2)

- wall 4 steps right and 1 up: (4,1)

- wall 4 steps right: (4,0)

- wall 4 steps right and 1 down: (4,-1)

- wall 4 steps right and 2 down: (4,-2)

- wall 4 steps right and 3 down: (4,-3)

So, the walls are all at x=4, various y positions. So, moving to (2,0) and (2,1) is clear. So, I can move right twice and up once to get to the ""is"" rule.

2. Once I'm at (2,1), I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it down to where the key is, which is at (0,-1). Wait, the key is 1 step down from where? Let me check:

The key is 1 step down, but from where? The observation says ""key 1 step down,"" but I think it's relative to the starting position. So, if I'm at (0,0), the key is at (0,-1).

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule from (2,1) to (0,-1). That's a distance of 2 left and 2 down.

But I can only move one step at a time. So, I need to move left twice and down twice with the ""is"" rule.

But wait, can I carry the ""is"" rule while moving? Yes, because I'm Baba, and I can pick up and move text blocks.

So, the steps would be:

- Move right twice to (2,0).

- Move up once to (2,1) to pick up the ""is"" rule.

- Then, move left twice to (0,1).

- Then, move down twice to (0,-1), where the key is.

But wait, moving down from (0,1) to (0,0) is possible, but then to (0,-1), is that allowed? I think so, as long as there's no wall there.

Looking at the walls, the only walls at x=0 are not mentioned, so I think it's clear.

Once I'm at (0,-1) with the ""is"" rule, I can place it next to the key, creating the rule ""key is win.""

Then, I just need to move to the key, which is now the win condition.

But wait, the key is at (0,-1), and I'm already there with the ""is"" rule. So, after placing the ""is"" rule next to the key, the rule ""key is win"" is active. Then, I can step on the key to win.

Alternatively, maybe I just need to be next to the key after creating the rule.

Wait, but I'm already at the key's position. So, perhaps after creating the rule, I automatically win.

But to be safe, I should move onto the key after creating the rule.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right twice to (2,0).

2. Move up once to (2,1) to pick up the ""is"" rule.

3. Move left twice to (0,1).

4. Move down twice to (0,-1), placing the ""is"" rule next to the key, creating ""key is win.""

5. Then, move onto the key to win.

But I need to make sure that each move is valid and that I don't hit any walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let me see if there's a shorter way.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (2,1), and the key is at (0,-1). So, moving left twice and down twice from (2,1) would get me to (0,-1). That's four moves, but I can do it step by step.

But I also need to make sure that the path is clear. Since the walls are at x=4, I shouldn't have any issues moving left and down.

Another consideration: when I move the ""is"" rule, I need to ensure that I'm not creating any conflicting rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to another object, it might create a new rule unintentionally. But in this case, I'm moving it next to the key, which is what I want.

So, the steps I need to take are:

- Move right twice: right, right.

- Move up once: up.

- Then, move left twice: left, left.

- Then, move down twice: down, down.

But since I can only choose one action at a time, I need to decide the first move.

Wait, the user is asking for the next action, not the entire sequence. So, perhaps I should just move right first.

But let me think again. The initial position is (0,0). The ""is"" rule is at (2,1). To get there, I need to move right twice and up once.

So, the first move should be right.

But wait, in the previous interaction, the user was at a different position, but now the observation is current. So, I need to make sure I'm starting from the correct position.

Wait, the current observation shows the objects, but it doesn't specify where Baba is. Assuming Baba starts at (0,0), which is a common starting point.

So, the first action should be to move right to start heading towards the ""is"" rule.

But let me double-check. If I move right, I go to (1,0). Then, another right to (2,0), then up to (2,1). That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid any potential blocks, but I don't see walls in the way.

So, the first action is to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The rules are defined by text blocks like ""rule `is`"" or ""rule `win`."" These can be moved to create or change rules, which is crucial in this game.

First, I need to figure out where everything is. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The ball and key are also present, but I'm not sure how they factor into the solution yet. The rules are spread out, and some are close to each other, which might allow me to combine them or move them to create new rules.

Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. My movement is limited by walls unless I can change the rules to make walls passable. I notice there's a ""rule `stop`"" which might be making walls immovable. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make walls passable or even destroy them.

Looking at the positions, the ""rule `stop`"" is 2 steps up. I need to get close to it to move it. The ""rule `win`"" is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which seems far. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition to something closer or easier to reach.

I also see a ""rule `ball`"" and a ""rule `key`."" Perhaps manipulating these can help me get the key or the ball to change the win condition. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, which might be accessible if I can move around the walls.

I think the key strategy here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to make walls not stop me. Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is pass"" to allow movement through walls.

Another approach is to create a new rule that changes what ""WIN"" is. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would end the level. That might be easier than trying to reach the existing ""WIN"" object, which is quite far.

To do this, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" and the ""rule `key`"" closer together so I can combine them. Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" object next to the ""WIN"" rule to create a new rule.

I also notice that there's a ""rule `is`"" nearby, which I can use to form new rules. Maybe I can move the ""key"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" to make ""key is win.""

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the ""rule `stop`"" to change it. Since it's 2 steps up, I'll move up twice. But wait, I need to check if there are walls blocking that path. The walls are at various positions, so I need to navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to a different location by pushing it with Baba. If I can move it, I can change the rule. But I'm not sure if I can move rules directly or if I need to use other objects.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as ""STOP."" So if the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, walls can't be moved. But if I can change that rule, I can make walls movable.

So, my first goal is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `stop`"" and the ""rule `wall`"" to form a new rule. For example, if I can place ""rule `wall`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `push`,"" I can make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to move walls.

But looking at the positions, the ""rule `stop`"" is 2 steps up, and the ""rule `wall`"" is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. I need to get Baba near these rules to move them.

Let me try to move towards the ""rule `stop`."" I'll move up twice to reach it. But I need to check if there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I might need to move around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" to combine it with other rules. For example, moving ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `win`"" and ""rule `key`"" to make ""key is win.""

I think the most straightforward approach is to change the win condition to something closer. So, I'll try to move the ""key"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" to create ""key is win."" That way, I just need to pick up the key to win.

The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. I need to move Baba to that position. Let me plan the path. Starting from my current position, I'll move left once and down once to reach the key. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which might not block my path. I think it's safe to move left and down to get the key.

Once I have the key, if the rule ""key is win"" is active, I'll win the level. So, my steps are: move left, then down to pick up the key.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the rule ""key is win"" is active. To do that, I need to position the ""rule `key`"" and ""rule `win`"" correctly. Maybe I can move the ""rule `key`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" to form ""key is win.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `win`"" next to the key to create the new rule. But the ""rule `win`"" is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is far. That might not be feasible.

Perhaps a better approach is to create a new rule by moving the ""rule `is`"" between ""rule `key`"" and ""rule `win`."" That way, ""key is win"" becomes active.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""rule `is`"" that far. It might be easier to move the ""rule `key`"" closer to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`.""

Alternatively, I can try to make the walls passable so I can reach the ""rule `win`"" and change it. To do that, I need to modify the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Let me try to move towards the ""rule `stop`"" first. I'll move up twice to get closer. Then, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" to a different location, perhaps next to ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `is`"" to create a new rule like ""wall is push.""

Once walls are pushable, I can move them out of the way to reach other rules or the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can make walls passable, I can walk through them to reach the ""rule `win`"" and change it.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either change the win condition or make the path to the win condition easier.

Another idea: if I can make Baba into a different object, like a ball or a key, that might help. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can use Baba's movement to act as a key.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. I need to see if there are rules that can be combined to create such a transformation.

Looking back, the ""rule `ball`"" is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move the ""rule `ball`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `baba`"" to make ""baba is ball."" That would change Baba's properties to those of a ball, which might allow me to bounce or move differently.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. I think focusing on changing the win condition or making walls passable is more straightforward.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move towards the ""rule `stop`"" to change the wall properties.
2. Once walls are passable, move towards the ""rule `win`"" to change the win condition.
3. Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the key the win condition, allowing me to win by picking up the key.

I think the second approach is better because it's quicker. I'll try to create ""key is win.""

To do that, I need to position the ""rule `key`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`."" The ""rule `key`"" is 8 steps to the right. That's quite far, but if I can move it closer, I can form the new rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" closer to the key. But that might require moving multiple rules, which could be complex.

Maybe a better approach is to move the key next to the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`."" The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move it to a position where it's next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`,"" then ""key is win"" will be active.

But I'm not sure if I can move the key directly. I might need to manipulate the rules to make the key movable or to allow me to push it.

Wait, in the current setup, the key is just an object. If I can make it so that ""key is push,"" then I can push it into the correct position.

To do that, I need to create a rule like ""key is push."" That would require moving the ""rule `key`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `push`."" But I don't see a ""rule `push`"" in the current setup. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `push`"" together, but I'm not sure if ""rule `push`"" exists.

Alternatively, I can use the existing ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `stop`"" to create a new rule. For example, moving ""rule `stop`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `key`"" to make ""key is stop,"" but that might not help.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, if I can make the walls passable, I can reach the ""rule `win`"" and change it to something else.

To make walls passable, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. I can do this by moving the ""rule `stop`"" away from the wall rule. For example, moving ""rule `stop`"" next to another subject to create a new rule like ""something is stop,"" leaving walls without the stop property.

So, I'll try to move the ""rule `stop`"" to a different location. Let's say I move it next to ""rule `you`"" to make ""you is stop,"" which would stop me. That's not helpful. Alternatively, I can move it next to ""rule `ball`"" to make ""ball is stop,"" which would stop the ball.

Wait, but I want to stop the walls, not other objects. Maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" next to ""rule `wall`"" to reinforce the wall's stop property, but that's the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `wall`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `push`"" to make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push them.

But I don't see a ""rule `push`"" in the current setup. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `push`"" together, but I'm not sure if ""rule `push`"" exists.

Wait, perhaps I can use the existing ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `stop`"" to create a new rule. For example, moving ""rule `stop`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `wall`"" to make ""wall is stop,"" which is the current rule. That doesn't help.

I think I need to find another way. Maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me so I can reach it without dealing with walls. The ""rule `win`"" is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's quite far, but if I can move it closer, I can change the win condition.

Alternatively, I can create a new win condition by moving the ""rule `win`"" next to another object. For example, moving it next to the key to make ""key is win.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" to the key's position. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" from 8 steps right and 3 steps up to 1 step left and 1 step down. That's a long move, but maybe possible if I can navigate around the walls.

Wait, but moving rules requires me to be adjacent to them, right? So I need to get Baba next to the ""rule `win`"" to move it. That means I have to reach that position, which is blocked by walls unless I can make them passable.

This seems like a loop. I need to make walls passable to reach the ""rule `win`,"" but to make walls passable, I might need to change the rules, which requires moving rules, which might require moving through walls.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another way. Let me look for other rules that can help. There's a ""rule `ball`"" which is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can make the ball do something useful, like push walls or act as a key, that might help.

Alternatively, I can try to make Baba into a ball by creating the rule ""baba is ball."" That would allow me to use the ball's properties, which might help in moving or interacting with other objects.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `baba`."" The ""rule `baba`"" is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" to that area.

But that's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" to a position where it's between ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `ball`,"" creating ""baba is ball.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `baba`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `ball`"" to create the same effect.

This seems possible. Let me try to plan that. I'll move towards the ""rule `baba`"" which is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. Then, I'll move the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `ball`"" into position to create ""baba is ball.""

Once that rule is active, Baba will have the properties of a ball, which might allow me to bounce or move differently, potentially bypassing walls or reaching new areas.

After that, I can use the ball's movement to reach the key or the win condition more easily.

So, my steps would be:

1. Move towards the ""rule `baba`"" by moving left twice and down three times.
2. Once there, move the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `ball`"" into position to create ""baba is ball.""
3. With Baba as a ball, move towards the key or the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving these rules doesn't disrupt other important rules. For example, if I move ""rule `is`,"" it might break the ""baba is you"" rule, which is essential for controlling Baba.

Wait, that's a problem. If I move ""rule `is`,"" the ""baba is you"" rule might be affected. I need to be careful not to break that rule.

Maybe instead of moving ""rule `is`,"" I can move ""rule `ball`"" and ""rule `baba`"" to form the new rule without affecting the existing ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, I can create a new ""is"" rule by moving another ""rule `is`"" into position. But I'm not sure if there are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks.

Looking back, I see that there are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks at different positions. So, perhaps I can use one of them to create the new rule without affecting the main ""baba is you"" rule.

For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" 1 step to the right and 1 step up. I can use that one to create ""baba is ball"" without touching the main ""is"" rule.

So, my plan is:

1. Move towards the ""rule `baba`"" which is 2 steps left and 3 steps down.
2. Once there, move the ""rule `is`"" (the one 1 step right and 1 step up) next to ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `ball`"" to create ""baba is ball.""
3. Now, Baba has the properties of a ball, allowing for different movement.
4. Use the ball's movement to reach the key or the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving these rules doesn't break the existing ""baba is you"" rule. Since I'm using a different ""rule `is`,"" it should be safe.

Once I've made Baba into a ball, I can move more freely, perhaps rolling through walls or moving in a different pattern to reach the key or the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball push walls, I can clear a path to the win condition.

Another thought: if I can make the ball into a key, then picking up the ball would allow me to win. That might be easier than dealing with the walls.

To do that, I can create the rule ""ball is key"" by moving the ""rule `ball`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `key`."" Then, the ball would act as a key, and picking it up would win","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe I need the key for something. There's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to change rules or move things.

I see several walls and rules scattered around. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up, which might mean that walls or other objects with ""stop"" can't be moved. The ""wall"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up, so walls are immovable unless I change that rule.

I also notice a ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right"" and a ""key"" object. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how do I get there? The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. Let me check if I can move there.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up, so if I move up twice, I might hit a wall or something that stops me. I need to be careful. Maybe I should first try to move towards the key. Let me see: moving left once and down once would get me to the key. But is that possible without hitting a wall?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is in the upper right area. Another wall is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and so on. It seems like the walls are forming a sort of barrier, but I'm not sure how they're arranged.

I think the key is near me, so maybe I should move towards it. If I move left once and down once, I can get the key. But I need to make sure that path is clear. Are there any walls blocking me? The walls are mostly to the right and up, so maybe the left and down paths are clear.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to change the rules to make the walls movable. If I can move a ""stop"" rule, I can make walls movable. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move it, I can change its property.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up in the current observation. So if I move up twice, I might be able to interact with it. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should first try to get the key since it's closer.

Let me try moving left once and down once to get the key. That would be the ""left"" and ""down"" actions. But I need to output just one action at a time. So first, I'll move left.

After moving left, I'll be one step to the left. Then, I can move down to pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the win condition or change a rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to change the win condition. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is quite far. If I can change the win condition to something closer, that would help.

I'm a bit confused about how the rules work. The ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba, but I need to manipulate other rules to progress. Maybe I should try to move a ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule.

Looking at the ""rule `is`"" blocks, there are several of them. For example, one is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, another is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, and so on. If I can move one of these to create a new rule like ""key is win,"" then the key would become the win condition, making it easier to win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" object. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition, and I can just pick it up.

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to be able to move it. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but I need to see if the ""is"" rule is movable. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up, so unless I change that, I can't move through walls or other stopped objects.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then walls become movable. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's 2 steps up. So if I move up twice, I can reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else, making walls movable.

Once walls are movable, I can rearrange them to create paths or change the layout. That might help me reach the key or the win condition more easily.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move it to a closer position, I can reach it without going all the way to the right.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires being able to move it, which depends on the current rules. If ""win"" is not stopped, I can move it. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first.

Let me try to move left to get closer to the key. So my first action would be ""left."" After that, I can move down to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can see if it changes anything or if I can use it to change a rule.

Alternatively, if I can't get the key immediately, maybe I should try to change the rules to make the key the win condition. That way, picking up the key would end the level.

To do that, I need to move an ""is"" rule next to the key. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So I need to move an ""is"" rule to that position. Let me see if there's an ""is"" rule nearby that I can move.

Looking at the ""rule `is`"" blocks, one is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule down twice and left once, it would be next to the key. But that requires being able to move the ""is"" rule, which might be blocked by walls or the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step up. If I move it down once and left once, it would be next to the key. That would create ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition.

But to move the ""is"" rule, I need to be able to move it. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but I need to see if the ""is"" rule is movable. If it's not stopped, I can move it.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key to create ""key is win."" That way, I can just pick up the key to win. So I'll need to move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step up down once and left once.

But how do I do that? I need to move Baba to the position of the ""is"" rule, then move it. Let me see: the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. So I can move up once to reach it, then move it left once and down once.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule requires that it's not stopped. If the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up, then moving up twice would hit a wall. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule without moving Baba there. I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule directly.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving left to get closer to the key and see what happens. So my action would be ""left.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's behavior.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, it's 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. To get there, I might need to move through the map, but there are walls in the way. I also see a ""key"" object, which is 1 step down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I notice there's a ""ball"" object 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to break walls or activate certain rules. Maybe I can use the ball to clear a path or change a rule.

The rules themselves are scattered. There's a ""wall"" rule, a ""stop"" rule, and a ""ball"" rule. If I can move these around, I might be able to change how walls or the ball behave. For example, if I can make ""ball is stop,"" the ball might stop moving, which could help me position it where I need it.

I also see a ""key"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's near the ""WIN"" rule. Maybe if I can get the key to the right place, I can unlock the win condition or change it.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. I need to plan a path to the key or the ball. Let me see: starting from my position, I can move right or up. Moving right might get me closer to the key and the win condition, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls if I can manipulate the rules.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ball object, I might be able to change the ball's properties. For example, if I make ""ball is you,"" the ball could become controllable, which would help me reach higher places or break through walls.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball could become the win condition, which might be easier to reach. But I need to see if that's possible.

I also see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make ""stop is you,"" then I might be able to stop certain objects from moving, which could help me control the game better.

But first, I need to get to the ball or the key. Let me try to move towards the ball. It's 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, I can move right twice and up twice. But I need to check if there are walls blocking my path.

Looking at the walls, there are walls 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is where the ""WIN"" rule is. So, moving right might be blocked by walls. Maybe I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, I can try to move up first to get around the walls. Let me see: moving up once, then right, then up again. That might get me past the walls.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 2 steps right and 2 up. So, if I move right twice and up twice, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there are no walls in that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 right and 3 up, which is beyond the ball's position. So, maybe the path is clear. Let me try moving right twice and up twice to get to the ball.

Once I'm next to the ball, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to change its properties. For example, moving the ""ball"" rule next to the ball to make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball to create a new rule. Maybe ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition, which I can then reach.

But I need to be careful with the rules. If I change a rule incorrectly, it might make the game unsolvable. So, I should plan carefully.

Another thought: the key is 1 step down. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule that requires a key. But I'm not sure how the key is used in this level.

I also see a ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is you,"" then I might be able to stop myself or other objects, which could help in positioning.

But for now, I think the best course of action is to move towards the ball to see if I can use it to change the rules or break through walls. So, I'll move right twice and up twice to get to the ball's position.

Wait, but in the observation, the ball is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, moving right twice and up twice should get me there. Let me try that.

After moving, I'll be next to the ball. Then, I can try to move the ""ball"" rule to change its properties. Maybe making ""ball is you"" would let me control the ball, which could help me reach the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, which I can then reach by moving to it.

But I need to make sure I'm not creating conflicting rules. So, I should carefully plan which rules to change.

In summary, my plan is to move towards the ball, then manipulate the rules to either control the ball or make it the win condition. This should help me progress towards winning the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's behavior.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. It's 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. To get there, I might need to move through the map, but there are walls in the way. I also see a ""key"" object, which is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, like a door or to change a rule.

I notice there's a ""ball"" object 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls. Maybe I can use the ball to clear a path or to move a rule block.

The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up, which probably means that any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved. I need to be careful not to get stuck by these.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" blocks. If I can move these, I might be able to change the rules of the game. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would win the level immediately. Alternatively, I could change the win condition to something else.

I also see ""rule `wall`"" 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move this, I might be able to make walls passable or change their properties.

The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe I need to pick up the key first to unlock a door or to move a rule block that's currently blocked.

I should plan my path. Starting from Baba's position, I need to move towards the key. Let's see: moving left once and down once would get me to the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to interact with a locked rule block.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push a rule block into a position that changes the rules. For example, pushing ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is something.""

Wait, but I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" I need to make sure the objects I'm trying to move aren't stopped.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move left to reach the key.
2. Pick up the key.
3. Use the key to unlock a rule block or move it.
4. Change a rule to make the win condition easier to reach.
5. Move towards the new win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules without needing the key. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" to create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. Let's see, from my current position, moving left once and down once would get me to the key. So the action would be ""left"" followed by ""down."" But since I can only choose one action at a time, I'll start with ""left.""

Wait, but in the previous interactions, the user was moving right and left, and the assistant was responding with ""left"" or ""right."" Maybe I should consider the immediate next step.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to get closer to the ""win"" rule. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can break through them using the ball.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. I think the best first step is to move towards the key to see if it unlocks something. So I'll choose ""left"" to start moving in that direction.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the usual ""WIN"" rule. The ""WIN"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far, so I need to figure out how to get there.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how do I move towards it? Let me see the possible actions: idle, up, right, down, left. I can move in any direction, but I need to make sure I'm not hitting any walls or getting stuck.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. That might mean that if I move into that area, I can't move further. I should avoid that. Also, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps up, which probably means that walls are immovable.

I see a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how yet.

The ""key"" is 1 step down. If I move down, I can reach it. But I need to make sure that moving down doesn't lead me into a ""stop"" area or a wall. Let me check the walls around me. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is where the ""WIN"" rule is. So I need to get around that.

Maybe I can move right to get closer to the ""WIN"" rule. But there are walls in the way. Alternatively, moving down to get the key might be the first step. Once I have the key, perhaps I can unlock a path to the ""WIN"" rule.

Let me plan my moves. First, I'll move down to pick up the key. Then, I can see if the key allows me to break through walls or change the rules somehow. After that, I can head towards the ""WIN"" rule.

Wait, but moving down might take me into a ""stop"" area. Let me check the ""stop"" rule again. It's 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So if I'm currently at a certain position, moving down might not trigger the ""stop"" rule. I think it's safe to move down.

So, my first action should be to move down to get the key. That way, I can potentially unlock the path to the ""WIN"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are marked as ""wall,"" which might be immovable unless I change their properties. The ball is at 2 steps right and 3 up. The key is 9 steps right and 1 up. There are also several ""is"" rules, which are probably the rule blocks I can move to create new rules.

I think the key is to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or make the walls movable. If I can move a ""stop"" rule onto a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop me, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make the wall ""you,"" then I can move through it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop me, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I can make the wall ""push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Another approach: maybe I can make the ball ""win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule onto the ball, then the ball becomes the win condition. But the ball is at 2 right, 3 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. That's a long way to move.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is win."" If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule, then ""ball is win"" would mean the ball becomes the win condition. But I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 4 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. The ball is at 2 right, 3 up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the ball.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is also at 2 right, 2 up. So there's another ""is"" rule closer to the ball. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ball and then move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can create ""ball is win.""

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's at 9 right, 4 up. That's far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ball is. But I can't move rule blocks directly; I have to move them by moving the text blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""you,"" so I can control it. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can move the ball as if it's me. That might help me reach the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. That's below me. So I need to move the ""is"" rule down to the ""you"" rule and next to the ball.

Wait, the ball is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. That's a big gap. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to the ball. But I can't move rule blocks unless they're text blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 2 right, 2 up next to the ball at 2 right, 3 up. Then, if I can move the ""you"" rule next to that, I can create ""ball is you.""

But the ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. That's far. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up. But I can't move it directly. I need to find a way to move it by creating a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall ""push."" If I can make a wall ""push,"" then I can push it to clear a path. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can move that to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop me, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I can make the wall ""move,"" then I can move through it.

But I don't see a ""move"" rule. Hmm.

Another idea: maybe I can make the key ""win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key, then the key becomes the win condition. The key is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. So if I can move the ""win"" rule down to the key's position, then ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I can't move it directly unless I have a way to move it via other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule. The key is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule down to 9 right, 2 up, then I can create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think about the steps.

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up down to 9 right, 2 up. But I can't move it directly; I have to move it by moving the text block.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is a text block, so I can move it if it's not stopped. Are there any walls or stops in the way? The path from 8 right, 4 up to 9 right, 2 up would require moving right and down. Are there walls blocking that path? Let me check the objects.

Looking at the objects, there are walls at 4 right, 4 up; 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; 4 right; 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; 4 right, 3 down. So the path to the right is clear until 4 right, but beyond that, I don't see walls. Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 4 up, so moving right from there would go beyond 4 right. So maybe the path is clear.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down first. Let me try to move down from 8 right, 4 up to 8 right, 3 up. Then right to 9 right, 3 up, then down to 9 right, 2 up. That would place the ""is"" rule next to the key at 9 right, 1 up. Then, if I move the ""win"" rule down to 9 right, 2 up, I can create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to meet the ""is"" rule and the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""win"" by moving the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to the ball. The ball is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 2 right, 2 up. So if I move the ""is"" rule up to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball, and then move the ""win"" rule next to that, I can create ""ball is win.""

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule left to 2 right, 4 up, then down to 2 right, 3 up. But I can't move the ""win"" rule directly unless I have a way to move it via other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule ""win is you,"" making the win condition something I can reach. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can make the walls ""move."" If I can make walls movable, I can push them out of the way. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""wall is move."" But I don't see a ""move"" rule here. Alternatively, I can make walls ""push"" if there's a ""push"" rule, but I don't see that either.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls ""stop,"" but that would make them immovable, which is the default.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule closer to the ball and see if I can create a new rule that helps me.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule from 2 right, 2 up up to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball. Then, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to that, I can create ""ball is win."" But the ""win"" rule is too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule left to 2 right, 4 up, then down to 2 right, 3 up. But I can't move the ""win"" rule directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down by creating a new rule that allows me to move it. For example, if I can make ""win is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""win is you,"" so I can control the win condition. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule and the ""you"" rule, I can create ""win is you."" Then, I can move the win condition as if it's me.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up down to 9 right, 4 up, then next to the ""you"" rule. But that's a long way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to the ""win"" rule. But I can't move the ""you"" rule directly unless I have a way to move it via other rules.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for any movable rule blocks that can help me create a new rule.

I see a ""ball"" rule at 5 right, 2 up. If I can move that next to the ball, I can create ""ball is ball,"" which doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I can create ""ball is win.""

But the ""ball"" rule is at 5 right, 2 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. That's a distance. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule right to 9 right, 2 up, then up to 9 right, 4 up, next to the ""win"" rule. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to both to create ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move the ""ball"" rule from 5 right, 2 up right to 6 right, 2 up.
2. Continue moving right until it's at 9 right, 2 up.
3. Then move up to 9 right, 4 up, next to the ""win"" rule.
4. Move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up right to 9 right, 4 up, next to the ""win"" rule and the ""ball"" rule.
5. Now, the rule ""ball is win"" is created, making the ball the win condition.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""ball"" rule that far. There might be walls or other obstacles in the way. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects, there are walls at 4 right, 4 up; 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; 4 right; 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; 4 right, 3 down. So moving right beyond 4 right is clear, as there are no walls mentioned beyond that. So moving the ""ball"" rule from 5 right to 9 right should be possible.

Once the ""ball"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up, I can move it up to 9 right, 4 up. Then, move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up to 9 right, 4 up. Now, the ""is"" rule is between the ""ball"" rule and the ""win"" rule, creating ""ball is win.""

Now, the ball becomes the win condition. So I just need to reach the ball. The ball is at 2 right, 3 up. I'm at Baba's position, which is controlled by ""baba is you."" So I need to move Baba to the ball's position.

But wait, if the ball is now the win condition, then reaching it would win the level. So I just need to move to the ball's position.

But how? The ball is at 2 right, 3 up. I'm at Baba's position, which is probably near the starting point. Let me check the objects again.

The key is at 9 right, 1 up. The ball is at 2 right, 3 up. So I need to move left from the key's position to reach the ball. But I'm not sure where Baba is exactly. Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so Baba is me. I need to move Baba to the ball's position.

But if I've created ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. So I just need to move to the ball's position.

But wait, the ball is at 2 right, 3 up. I'm at Baba's position, which is probably near the starting point. Let me see the objects again.

The key is at 9 right, 1 up. The ball is at 2 right, 3 up. So I need to move left from the key's position to reach the ball. But I'm not sure if there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""you,"" so I can control it. If I can create ""ball is you,"" then I can move the ball as if it's me.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from 2 right, 2 up down to 1 right, 2 down, next to the ""you"" rule, and then next to the ball.

But that's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to the ball's position. But I can't move the ""you"" rule directly unless I have a way to move it via other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create ""you is ball,"" making me the ball. Then, I can move as the ball.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""you"" rule and the ""ball"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right, 2 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from 2 right, 2 up down to 1 right, 2 down, next to the ""you"" rule, and then next to the ""ball"" rule.

But that's a long path. I'm not sure if it's feasible.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the key. The key is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can reach the key, maybe it can help me unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key ""win."" If I can create ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule.

The key is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule down from 8 right, 4 up to 9 right, 2 up, then next to the key, I can create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up right to 9 right, 4 up.
2. Then move down to 9 right, 3 up, then to 9 right, 2 up, then to 9 right, 1 up, next to the key.
3. Now, the ""is"" rule is between the ""win"" rule and the key, creating ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule that far down. There might be walls or other obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to meet the key. But I can't move the ""win"" rule directly unless I have a way to move it via other rules.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to make the ball ""win"" and then move to the ball.

So, to recap, I think the best course of action is to create ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule. Then, I can move to the ball to win the level.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule closer to the ball first.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule from 2 right, 2 up up to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball. Then, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to that, I can create ""ball is win.""

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. That's too far","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, which probably makes walls immovable. The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps down, which might be useful for creating new rules.

I think the key here is to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or change the win condition. Maybe if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and another subject, I can redefine what ""win"" means. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then reaching myself would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule closer. It's currently 2 steps down. If I can move it next to ""win,"" which is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up, that might work. But that's a long distance. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule with the existing components.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball could become the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea: the ""key"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to collect the key first to unlock something. But I'm not sure how that ties into the rules.

I'm also noticing that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can stack them to create a new rule. For example, if I have ""baba is you"" and ""you is win,"" then Baba would be win. But I don't see a ""you is win"" rule yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and another subject to redefine it. Let's say I move ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""baba,"" making ""baba is win."" That would mean reaching Baba would win the game, which is already the case since I am Baba. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""win is you,"" so that the win condition is me. But I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, making ""win is key"" could change the win condition to the key.

I think the best approach is to try to create a new rule that allows me to win by reaching the key or the ball. Let me see how I can move the ""is"" rule to create that.

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule is 2 steps down. If I can move it next to ""win"" and another subject, I can create a new rule. But moving it that far might require multiple steps, and I might get blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""ball"" to break through walls. If I can make ""ball is break,"" then the ball can destroy walls. But I don't see a ""break"" rule here.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but that's already the case. Maybe I can change it to ""wall is move"" or something else.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""is"" rule to see if I can create a new rule nearby. Let me try moving up to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

After moving up, I can then move right to position the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and another subject. Once I have the new rule set up, I can test if it changes the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" closer to redefine it. If I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the game. But I need to figure out how to move the key.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the win condition or make movement easier. I'll try moving towards the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That seems like the target I need to reach. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I see several walls positioned around me, which might block my path. There's also a ""ball"" object two steps to the right and two steps up. I remember that in Baba Is You, objects can be moved if they aren't defined as ""stop."" So maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or change some rules.

There are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around, which are essential for creating or modifying rules. For example, there's a ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up,"" which I might be able to use to create a new rule if I move it next to another object.

The key is one step down, which might be useful for unlocking something, but I'm not sure yet. There's also a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right,"" which could mean that the key is needed to interact with something else on the map.

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down, and the ""you"" rule is one step to the right and three steps down. Maybe if I move these, I can change what Baba is or what ""you"" represents, which could help me navigate or change the win condition.

Since I'm currently at the starting position, I need to plan a path towards the ""win"" object. The walls are positioned in a way that might require me to move around them. Let me try to visualize the map:

- Walls are at (4 right, 3 up), (4 right, 2 up), (4 right, 1 up), (4 right), (4 right, 1 down), (4 right, 2 down), and (4 right, 3 down). So, there's a vertical line of walls on the right side, which might block my path if I go straight right.

- The ""win"" rule is at (9 right, 3 up), which is far to the right. To get there, I might need to go around the walls. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls on the right.

- The ""ball"" is at (2 right, 2 up). If I can move the ball, perhaps I can use it to break through a wall or create a new rule.

- The ""key"" is one step down, which might be useful if there's a locked door or another rule that requires it.

Let me think about the possible moves. Since I'm starting at the origin, moving up might be a good idea to avoid the walls on the right. If I move up, I can then move right towards the ""win"" object without being blocked.

Alternatively, I could try to move right first, but the walls might block my path. So moving up first seems safer.

Another thought: if I can create a new rule by moving an ""is"" rule next to another object, I might be able to change the properties of that object. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball,"" I could create a rule like ""ball is push"" or something else that allows me to move the ball and clear a path.

But since I'm just starting, maybe it's better to focus on moving towards the ""win"" object first. Let me try moving up to avoid the walls and then right.

Wait, but the ""win"" object is to the right and up. So moving up first would take me closer to it. Let me try that.

So, my first move should be up. That way, I can start moving towards the ""win"" object without immediately hitting a wall. After moving up, I can assess the new layout and decide the next steps.

Alternatively, if moving up doesn't help, I might need to move left or right, but given the walls on the right, moving up seems the best initial move.

I think I'll go with moving up first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should note the positions of important objects. The ""win"" rule is at (9,2). The ""key"" is 2 steps down, which might be useful for opening something. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Rules like ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" and ""key"" are placed in various locations.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

I notice that the ""key"" is 2 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. But to get the key, I need to move down, but there might be walls blocking me. Let me check the walls' positions. There are walls at (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), (4,-3), and (4,-4). So, moving right to 4 steps and then down might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move a ""stop"" rule away from a wall, that wall won't stop me anymore. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" to make them movable.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at (2,1). If I can make the ball do something, maybe it can help me reach the key or the win condition. For example, if I can make the ball ""is win,"" then hitting the ball would win the level. But I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, which is 7 steps to the left and 1 step down from the ball's current position. That seems complicated.

Another idea: the ""key"" is at (0,-2). If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe the key is for a different purpose. Perhaps the key can be used to change a rule.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step down."" That might mean that the key is defined by that rule. If I can move the key's rule, I might be able to change what the key does.

I also see that there's a ""rule `is` 4 steps down."" Maybe moving that could help create a new rule involving ""is."" For example, if I can place ""is"" next to another rule, I can combine them into a new rule.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Each move could potentially allow me to reach a rule block and move it. For example, if I move right, I might get closer to some rule blocks that I can then move.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at (8,2). If I can move that closer, I can combine it with other rules. Maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But that would require moving the ""win"" rule from (9,2) to next to me.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then getting the key would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The key is at (0,-2), and the ""win"" rule is at (9,2). That's a long distance, but maybe I can move the ""win"" rule left.

But moving rule blocks requires me to be adjacent to them. So I need to navigate to where the rule blocks are. Let's see: the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 2 up. That's far, but maybe I can move right step by step.

Wait, I'm at (0,0) as Baba. The walls are at (4,y), so moving right beyond 4 is blocked. So I can't reach the ""win"" rule directly because of the walls. Maybe I need to change the walls' properties.

If I can make the walls passable, I can move through them. To do that, I need to change the rule for walls. Currently, the rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can change that to ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property, I can move through them.

How can I change the wall's rule? I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,1). If I can move it somewhere else, the walls will no longer stop me.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right to reach the ""stop"" rule at (1,1).
2. Move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, perhaps down or up.
3. Once the walls are no longer stopping me, move right through them to reach the ""win"" rule.
4. Move the ""win"" rule next to me to make ""baba is win,"" which would let me win by being myself.

But wait, moving the ""stop"" rule might require me to be adjacent to it. Let me check the path. From (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to grab the ""stop"" rule. Then I can move it down to (1,0) or somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at (-1,1). If I can move it next to a different object, I can change what walls are.

But I think the first approach is better. Let's try moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down to (1,0), making the walls no longer stop me.

Once the walls are passable, I can move right through them to reach the ""win"" rule at (9,2). Then, I can move the ""win"" rule next to me, making ""baba is win,"" which would let me win by being myself.

So, the first step is to move right to (1,0). Then up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down to (1,0). After that, the walls won't stop me, and I can proceed right.

But wait, moving the ""stop"" rule might not be enough. I need to make sure that the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property. Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule to remove their stopping ability.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" but that might not be helpful.

Another thought: if I can make ""ball is win,"" then hitting the ball would win the level. The ball is at (2,1). If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, that would work. But the ""win"" rule is at (9,2), so that's a long way.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is win,"" so getting the key would win. The key is at (0,-2). So, if I can move the ""win"" rule down to (0,-2), then picking up the key would win.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires me to reach it, which is blocked by walls. So, I need to first make the walls passable.

So, the priority is to make the walls passable. To do that, I need to modify the ""wall is stop"" rule. Either remove the ""stop"" or change it.

The ""stop"" rule is at (1,1). If I can move it away, the walls will no longer stop me. So, moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down to (1,0).

After that, the walls are passable. Then I can move right through them. Once I'm past the walls, I can move up to reach the ""win"" rule at (9,2). Then, I can move the ""win"" rule next to me, making ""baba is win,"" which would let me win.

Alternatively, once past the walls, I can look for other rule blocks that might help me reach the key or the win condition more easily.

So, the immediate action is to move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down to (1,0). That should make the walls passable.

But wait, in the current observation, the walls are at (4,y), so moving right beyond 4 is blocked. So, I need to make sure that after moving the ""stop"" rule, I can move right past 4.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change their properties. The ""wall"" rule is at (-1,1). If I can move it next to a different rule, like ""push,"" then walls become pushable.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule mentioned. So, perhaps the best approach is to remove the ""stop"" from walls by moving the ""stop"" rule.

So, the first step is to move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down to (1,0). After that, the walls won't stop me, and I can move right past them.

Once I'm past the walls, I can navigate to the ""win"" rule and make ""baba is win,"" which would let me win by being myself.

So, the immediate action is to move right to (1,0). Then up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down to (1,0).

But in the current state, I'm at (0,0). So, the first move is to move right to (1,0).

Wait, but looking at the objects, there's a wall at (4,2), (4,1), etc. So, moving right beyond 4 is blocked. But if I can make the walls passable, I can move right.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Move up to (1,1) to get the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move down to (1,0) to place the ""stop"" rule there, removing it from the walls.
4. Now, walls are passable. Move right past 4.
5. Move up to reach the ""win"" rule at (9,2).
6. Move the ""win"" rule next to me to make ""baba is win.""
7. Then, I win by being Baba.

Alternatively, after step 3, I can move right through the walls.

So, the first action is to move right to (1,0).

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object, but I need to figure out how to get there.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There are also several rule blocks scattered around. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which seems pretty far. There's a ball and a key involved too, which might be important.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which probably means I can create new rules by moving them. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to another object, I can change the rules of the game. Maybe I can make the ball or the key into something else.

The key is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But to get there, I might need to move through some walls or change the rules so that walls become passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step up. If I can change that, maybe I can make walls stop being solid. Or perhaps I can make the ball into a ""stop"" so that it blocks something else.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. If I can pick up the key, perhaps it will help me unlock the win condition. But I need to figure out how to get past the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to the ""ball"" or ""key"" to change their properties. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then the ball could become the win condition, which might be easier to reach.

Let me try to plan my moves. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move towards the key, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to change the walls into something else.

Wait, there's a ""wall"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the walls into something passable. Or perhaps I can make the walls into ""stop"" so that they block movement, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""ball"" to make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. Then I could use the ball to reach the key or the win condition.

I think I'll try moving towards the key first. Let me see how many steps I need to take. The key is 1 step left and 2 steps down from my current position. So I need to move left once and down twice.

But there are walls in the way. Let me check the positions. The wall is 3 steps right and 2 steps up, which is above me. So maybe I can move down first to avoid the wall.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. If I move down, I might hit a wall. Let me check the objects again. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is above me. So moving down might be safe.

I'll try moving down once. Now I'm one step down. Next, I need to move left once to reach the key. But is there a wall in that path? The wall is 3 steps right and 2 steps up, so moving left from my current position shouldn't hit a wall.

Wait, there's another wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So moving left from my current position (after moving down) should be clear. I'll move left once. Now I'm at the key's position. Do I pick up the key? Or do I need to do something else?

Hmm, maybe I should try to create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""key,"" I can make ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key to win.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to be next to it and then move it. The ""is"" block is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is far away. Maybe I can move towards it after getting the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a ""stop"" so that it blocks the walls. But I'm not sure.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps to the right. If I can make ""ball is stop,"" then the ball would block movement, which might help me navigate.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""is"" block to create a new rule. Let me see how to get there. The ""is"" block is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's a long way, but maybe I can find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to unlock something. If I pick up the key, perhaps I can use it to change the rules. But I'm not sure how.

I think I'll try moving towards the key first. Let me move left once and down twice to reach it. Then, I'll see what options I have.

After moving left once and down twice, I'm at the key's position. Now, what can I do? Maybe I can move the key to create a new rule. If I can move the key next to an ""is"" block, I can make ""key is win,"" which would let me win by reaching the key.

But I need to move the key. To do that, I need to be next to it and then move it. Let me try that. I'll move up once to get next to the key, then move the key to the right or left to create a new rule.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I'm at the key's position, I can move up once to get next to it. Then, I can move the key to the right or left to create a new rule.

Let me try moving the key to the right. Now, the key is next to an ""is"" block. So the new rule becomes ""key is win."" Now, reaching the key will win the level.

But I'm already at the key's position. So does that mean I've already won? Or do I need to move to the key's new position?

Hmm, maybe I need to move to the key's new position to trigger the win condition. Let me try moving right once to where the key is now. If that works, I'll win.

Alternatively, maybe I can just stay where I am since I'm already at the key's position, and the new rule makes it the win condition.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think moving the key next to the ""is"" block to make ""key is win"" is the right approach. Then, I just need to be on the key's tile to win.

So, to summarize, I'll move left once and down twice to reach the key, then move the key next to an ""is"" block to create the ""key is win"" rule. Then, I'll be on the key's tile, which should trigger the win condition.

I think that's the plan. Let me try executing it step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up."" So, the win condition is 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up from my current position. That's pretty far, so I need to find a way to get there.

I also notice a ""key"" object 2 steps down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" which might mean that the key has some special property. Perhaps if I pick up the key, I can change the rules to make the win condition easier to reach.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of the solution. There's also a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" so moving the ball might change its properties.

I see several ""rule `is`"" blocks, which are essential because they define the rules. If I can move these, I can create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I need to see if that's possible.

The walls are in the way, but I can move them if they're not ""STOP"" or another immovable property. I need to check if any walls are movable. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up"" suggests that walls have some property, but I'm not sure if they're stoppable or not.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key first because it might help me change the rules. The key is 2 steps down, so I'll move down twice. Once I have the key, maybe I can move it next to a ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule, like ""key is win"" or ""key is you."" That could help me reach the win condition more easily.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `win`"" block closer to me, but that might be complicated. Another idea is to make Baba into something else, like a ""WIN"" object, by rearranging the rules.

Wait, if I can move the ""rule `you`"" block, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps down, I might be able to change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you is win,"" then reaching the win condition would be automatic.

But I need to get to the ""rule `you`"" block first. It's 1 step to the right and 4 steps down, which is a bit far. Maybe I should prioritize getting the key first to see if it can help me change the rules more effectively.

So, my plan is to move down twice to get the key. Once I have the key, I'll look for a ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule that helps me win. Alternatively, I might need to move other rule blocks to set up the necessary conditions.

I should also be cautious of walls. If a wall is in the way, I need to see if it's movable. If it's a ""STOP"" wall, I can't move through it, so I'll have to find another path.

Another thought: the ball is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe moving the ball can help me break through walls or create a path. If I can make the ball ""is push"" or something, I could use it to move walls out of the way.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to focus on getting the key first. Once I have the key, I can see what other rule changes I can make.

So, to summarize, I'll move down twice to get the key. Then, I'll use the key to create a new rule that helps me reach the win condition. If that doesn't work, I'll look for other rule changes or ways to move walls out of the way.

I think moving down twice is the best first step. Let's try that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are probably ""STOP"" by default, so I can't move through them. The ball is at 2 steps right and 2 up. The key is 1 step down. There are several ""is"" rules, which I can use to create new rules by moving them.

I think the key might be important. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. The key is 1 step down, so I need to move down to reach it. But I'm currently at the starting position, so I need to plan my path.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure yet. Let me see the other rules.

There's a ""ball"" rule 5 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the ball do something else. The ""key"" rule is 9 steps right, which is far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key do something useful.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step down, I should move down. But I need to make sure there's a path. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps right and 3 up, which might block my way. Maybe I can move a rule to change the wall's property.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I could move through them. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me try to move down to get the key. If I move down, I can pick up the key, which might help me unlock something else. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to open a door or change another rule.

So, my plan is to move down to get the key. That should be the first step. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are probably ""STOP"" by default, so I can't move through them. The ball is at 2 steps right and 3 up. The key is 9 steps right and 1 step up. There are also several ""is"" rules, which I can use to create new rules by moving them.

I think the key is to change the win condition or make something else winnable. Maybe if I can make the ball or the key the win condition, it would be easier. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba into something else, like a ball or a key, to bypass obstacles.

Let me see the positions again. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. The ""key"" is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""ball"" is at 2 right, 3 up. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 right, 4 up, which is next to the ""win"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""key is win"" or ""ball is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" or ""ball."" The ""is"" rule at 8 right, 4 up is close to the ""win"" rule. If I move it down, I can place it next to the ""key"" at 9 right, 1 up. But that's a long way down. Alternatively, there's another ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up. Maybe I can use that one.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up is near the ""ball"" at 2 right, 3 up. If I move the ""is"" rule up one step, it would be next to the ""ball,"" creating ""ball is win."" That could work. Then, I just need to reach the ball, and it would trigger the win condition.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from 2 right, 2 up to 2 right, 3 up. So, I should move up once. Let me check if that's possible. The path from Baba's position to the ""is"" rule might be blocked by walls, but I can try to navigate around.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key the win condition. The key is at 9 right, 1 up. There's an ""is"" rule at 9 right, 1 up as well? Wait, no, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 4 up. Hmm, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up down to 9 right, 1 up to make ""key is win.""

But that's a long distance. Maybe it's easier to use the ""is"" rule near the ball. Let me focus on that. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, making ""ball is win,"" then I just need to reach the ball.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up up to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball. Then, the rule becomes ""ball is win."" Once that's done, I can move towards the ball to win.

But wait, how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. So, I need to get Baba next to the ""is"" rule. Let me see where Baba is. The initial position isn't given, but I can assume Baba starts somewhere on the map. Let's say Baba is near the left side.

I need to move right to reach the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up. So, I should move right twice and up twice. But there might be walls blocking the way. Let me check the walls. There are walls at 4 right, 4 up; 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; 4 right; 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; 4 right, 3 down; 4 right, 4 down.

So, the path to the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up might be clear. Let me try moving right twice and up twice. If that's blocked, I might need to find another route.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 4 up down to 9 right, 1 up to make ""key is win."" But that's a longer move. Let me see if I can reach the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 4 up first.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 4 up is next to the ""win"" rule. If I move it down, I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

I think the easier path is to use the ""is"" rule near the ball. So, I'll try to move right twice and up twice to get next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move the ""is"" rule up to create ""ball is win.""

Once that's done, I can move towards the ball to win. Alternatively, if I can't move the ""is"" rule, maybe I can make Baba into a ball or a key to bypass walls.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and use it to open a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned, so maybe that's not necessary.

Alternatively, making ""baba is ball"" would allow me to push objects or move through certain areas. But again, I'm not sure if that's needed here.

I think the most straightforward approach is to change the win condition to the ball. So, I'll proceed with moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball.

So, the steps are:

1. Move right twice to reach column 2.
2. Move up twice to reach row 2.
3. Now, I'm next to the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up.
4. Move the ""is"" rule up to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball.
5. Now, the rule ""ball is win"" is active.
6. Move towards the ball to win.

But wait, can I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. So, after reaching 2 right, 2 up, I can move the ""is"" rule up.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ""is"" rule directly without moving Baba there, but I think I need to be adjacent to move it.

So, I'll proceed with moving right twice and up twice, then move the ""is"" rule up.

Let me check if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are at 4 right, various up and down positions, so moving to 2 right should be clear.

Once I've moved the ""is"" rule, the win condition changes, and I can move to the ball to win.

So, the action I need to take is to move right twice and up twice, then move the ""is"" rule up. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the user is asking for a single action. So, I need to choose one move. Given that, I should move right to start approaching the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule directly, that would be better. But I think I need to be adjacent first.

So, the first step is to move right to get closer to the ""is"" rule at 2 right, 2 up.

I think moving right is the best initial action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are probably ""STOP"" by default, so I can't move through them. The ball is at 1 step right and 3 up. The key is 1 step left. There are several ""is"" rules, which I can use to create new rules by moving them.

I think the key might be important. If I can get the key to the right place, maybe I can unlock something. The key is only 1 step left, so maybe I can move it closer to the win condition.

But wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me see the layout. The walls are creating a sort of barrier. I need to find a path through or around them. The ball is nearby, so maybe I can use it somehow.

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can change the rules by moving text blocks. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""ball,"" I can create a new rule like ""ball is something."" Maybe that can help me move the ball or change its properties.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps right and 2 up. If I can move the ""is"" block next to it, I can redefine the ball's properties. Maybe making the ball ""you"" so I can control it, or making it ""win"" to change the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to make the key ""win"" so that picking up the key wins the level. That might be a quicker path. The key is only 1 step left, so if I can make it the win condition, I just need to move left once.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" block next to the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is 8 steps right and 1 up. The ""is"" blocks are in various places, but I can move them. Let me see if I can get an ""is"" next to the ""key"" rule.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule 2 steps right and 2 up. If I move that ""is"" down to where the ""key"" rule is, I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to move left to the key and win.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" block from 2 right and 2 up down to where the ""key"" rule is. That would create ""key is win."" Then, move left to the key to win.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to move it step by step. Let me check the path. From the ""is"" at 2 right and 2 up, I can move down to 2 right and 1 up, then down again to 2 right. But there's a wall at 3 right and 1 up, so maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block left or right. Let me see the surrounding objects. There's a wall 3 right and 3 up, so maybe I can move the ""is"" left to 1 right and 2 up, then down to 1 right and 1 up, and so on.

Wait, maybe it's easier to move the ""key"" rule next to an existing ""is"" block. The ""key"" rule is 8 right and 1 up. There's an ""is"" rule at 8 right and 4 up. If I can move the ""key"" rule up to meet the ""is,"" that would create ""key is something."" But I don't know what that something is yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block from 8 right and 4 up down to 8 right and 1 up, where the ""key"" rule is. That would create ""key is win"" if I place it correctly.

But moving the ""is"" block all the way down might be tricky because of the walls. Let me see the path. From 8 right and 4 up, moving down step by step: 8 right and 3 up, 8 right and 2 up, 8 right and 1 up. Is that path clear? There's a wall at 4 right and 3 up, but that's not in the way. So maybe I can move the ""is"" block down to 8 right and 1 up, next to the ""key"" rule.

Once I've done that, the rule becomes ""key is win."" Then, I just need to move left to the key and win the level.

So, the steps are:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 8 right and 4 up down to 8 right and 1 up.
2. This creates the rule ""key is win.""
3. Then, move Baba left to the key, which is now the win condition.

But wait, can I move the ""is"" block that far? I need to make sure there's a clear path. Let me visualize the map. The ""is"" block is at 8 right and 4 up. Moving down, it goes through 8 right and 3 up, 8 right and 2 up, 8 right and 1 up. Are there any walls blocking that path? The walls are at 3 right and various up positions, so 8 right is clear.

Yes, I think that's possible. So, I'll move the ""is"" block down three times to reach 8 right and 1 up. Then, the rule ""key is win"" is created. After that, I just move left to the key to win.

Alternatively, if moving the ""is"" block is too cumbersome, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up to meet an ""is"" block. But that might require more steps.

Another idea: maybe I can make Baba into a key. If I can create a rule like ""baba is key,"" then I can use Baba as the key to win. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key wins. That seems straightforward.

So, focusing on moving the ""is"" block to create ""key is win."" Once that's done, moving to the key wins the level.

I think that's the best approach. So, the action would be to move the ""is"" block down to create the new rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far up. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to get to the win.

First, I should note the positions of important objects. The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from the current position. The ball is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. The ""is"" rule is nearby, which might be useful for creating new rules.

I think the key might be important because it's close. Maybe I can pick it up and use it to unlock something. But to get to the key, I need to move left and up. Let me see if there are any walls blocking my path. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but that's not in my immediate path.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 4 steps up. That could be a problem if I'm moving up because it might prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that or find a way to change it.

I also notice there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how yet.

Another thing is the ""baba"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. Since the key is 1 step left and 1 step up, I can move left and then up. Let me try that.

So, I'll move left first. That should get me closer to the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the win condition or change some rules to make the path easier.

Alternatively, if moving left is blocked by a wall, I might need to find another way. But from the observation, I don't see a wall directly in that path. So, moving left seems safe.

After getting the key, I can plan the next steps. Maybe I can combine the key with another rule to create a new rule that helps me reach the win.

I should also keep an eye on the ""stop"" rule. If I'm moving up, I don't want to hit that and get stuck. Maybe I can move around it or change the rule before approaching it.

In summary, my plan is to move left to get the key, then see how to proceed from there. This should give me a tool to manipulate the environment or rules further.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 5 step up."" So, the win condition is 9 steps right and 5 up from my current position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can get there by moving through the map.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step up. Keys are often used to unlock doors or change rules, so that might be useful. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps right and 4 up, which could be used to push things or change rules related to movement.

The walls are placed in a way that might create a path or block me. I need to see if I can move any walls or rules to create a clear path to the win condition. Since I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP"" or similar, I should check if any walls are movable.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 4 step up."" That means if I move that rule, I can change what stops movement. Maybe I can move it to allow me to pass through walls or other obstacles.

I also see ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up."" If I can move the ball or the rule, I might be able to change how the ball behaves, which could help me reach the win condition.

Another important rule is ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" This could be used to change Baba's properties, which might be necessary if I need to become something else to win.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to either change my movement capabilities or remove obstacles. Since the win condition is far to the right and up, I might need to create a path by moving walls or using the ball to push things.

Let me plan my steps:

1. Move towards the key first since it's close. If I can pick up the key, it might unlock something or allow me to change a rule that helps me progress.

2. Once I have the key, I can look for a rule that involves the key, like ""key is win"" or something similar, which could change the win condition to the key itself, making it easier to win.

3. Alternatively, I can try moving the ""stop"" rule to a different location, which might allow me to pass through walls or other stopping objects.

4. If moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't work, I can try moving the ""ball"" rule to change how the ball interacts with the environment, possibly creating a path or allowing me to push walls.

5. Another option is to move the ""baba"" rule to change my own properties, making me able to pass through walls or jump over obstacles.

6. I should also keep an eye on the ""WIN"" rule's position and see if moving any rules can bring it closer or make the path to it clearer.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move towards the key first. Once I have the key, I can look for a rule that allows me to win by picking up the key. If that's not possible, I'll try manipulating the ""stop"" rule to create a path.

So, my first move should be to go up to pick up the key. That way, I can use it to change the win condition or unlock a path.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up from my current position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can get there by moving through the map.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step down. Keys are often used to unlock something, so maybe I need to pick that up. But to get the key, I need to move down. However, I should check if there are any walls blocking that path. The observation mentions walls in various positions, so I need to be careful not to hit them.

Another important rule is ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" That means if I move right and up, I might hit a stop block, which would prevent me from moving further in that direction. I need to avoid that or find a way to change the rule so that stop doesn't affect me.

I also see a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 3 step up. Balls can sometimes be pushed or used to trigger certain actions. Maybe I can use the ball to reach the key or the win condition.

Looking at the rules, I can see that ""rule `is`"" is present in multiple places. These are the rule-making blocks, and I can move them to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move a ""is"" block next to another object, I can change the rules of the game.

One strategy could be to move the ""is"" block next to ""stop"" to change the stop rule. If I can make ""stop"" into something else, like ""stop is push,"" then I can push through stop blocks instead of being stopped by them. That would help me navigate the map more freely.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""baba is key"" so that I can pick up the key without needing to move into its position. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me plan my movements. I need to get to the key first, which is 1 step down. But I have to make sure that moving down doesn't lead me into a wall or a stop block. If I move down, I should check if there's a wall there. The observation says ""wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" so moving down from my current position might not hit a wall immediately.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a path to the win condition. But I'm not sure how the key interacts with other objects. Perhaps the key is needed to change a rule that allows me to reach the win.

Another thought: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer to me, that would make it easier to reach. But to do that, I need to manipulate the rules by moving the ""is"" blocks.

Wait, I see ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down."" If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba,"" I can change what Baba is. For example, making ""baba is win"" would mean that wherever I am, I can win. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, making ""baba is key"" would allow me to pick up the key without needing to move into its position. That could be useful.

Let me try to move towards the key first. I'll move down to pick up the key. But before I do that, I should check if moving down is safe. The observation mentions ""wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" but I'm not sure if that's in my path. If I'm currently at position (0,0), moving down would take me to (0,-1). Is there a wall there? The wall is at (4,1 down), which is (4,-1), so I think it's safe to move down.

So, I'll move down to get the key. Once I have the key, I can see if it allows me to change a rule or unlock a path. Alternatively, I can use the key to move other objects.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, the key is usually used to open locks, but since there are no locks mentioned, maybe the key is used to change rules. Perhaps the key can be used to move rule blocks.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to make a new rule that allows me to win. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move down and pick up the key. If that doesn't work, I can try another approach.

So, my plan is to move down to get the key. Then, I can see if I can use the key to change a rule or reach the win condition.

But wait, the key is at 1 step down, so I need to move down once. Let me do that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 5 step up."" So, the win condition is at (9,5). That's pretty far to the right and up. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is (0,0) or somewhere near the bottom left.

I also see a key at (9,2). Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ball at (2,4). I'm not sure what the ball does yet. The rules are spread out, so I might need to move some of them to create new rules or change existing ones.

Since I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP,"" I need to check if any of these rules or objects are immovable. The ""rule `stop`"" is at (1,4), so that's probably a stop sign, meaning I can't move through it. I need to avoid that.

I think the strategy here is to move towards the key first because it might be necessary to unlock the win condition. To get to the key at (9,2), I need to move right several times. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the walls' positions:

- wall 4 steps right and 5 up
- wall 4 right and 4 up
- wall 4 right and 3 up
- wall 4 right and 2 up
- wall 4 right and 1 up
- wall 4 right
- wall 4 right and 1 down
- wall 4 right and 2 down
- wall 4 right and 3 down
- wall 4 right and 4 down

So, there's a column of walls at x=4, from y=1 to y=5. That's a vertical line blocking my path to the right. I can't go through walls unless I change the rules.

Maybe I can move the ""rule `wall`"" which is at (-1,3). If I move it, I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through them. Alternatively, I could break the wall rule by moving the ""is"" or ""wall"" blocks.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `is`"" at various positions. If I can move an ""is"" block next to a ""wall"" block, I can create a new rule like ""wall is push."" That would allow me to push walls, which might help me move them out of the way.

Alternatively, I could make ""wall is nothing,"" which would remove the walls entirely. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the key at (9,2). To do that, I need to move right past the walls at x=4. So, I should try to change the wall rule.

First, I'll move towards the ""rule `wall`"" which is at (-1,3). Since I'm starting at (0,0), I need to move up three steps and left one step to reach it. But moving left from (0,0) might not be possible if there's a wall or edge. Let me check the map again.

Wait, the walls are at x=4, so moving left from (0,0) to (-1,3) might be possible if there's no wall blocking. I'll try moving up three times and left once to get to the ""rule `wall`.""

Once I have the ""wall"" block, I can move it next to an ""is"" block. Let's see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one at (8,5), which is far to the right and up. That's too far. There's another at (2,3), which is closer. So, I can move the ""wall"" block to (2,3) and place it next to the ""is"" block, creating ""wall is [something].""

But I need to decide what property to assign. If I make ""wall is push,"" I can push walls. If I make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through them. Alternatively, I could make ""wall is nothing"" to remove them.

Let's try making ""wall is pass."" So, I'll move the ""wall"" block to (2,3) and place it next to the ""is"" block there. That would create ""wall is pass."" Now, walls are passable, so I can walk through them.

Once I've done that, I can move right past the walls at x=4. Then, I can proceed towards the key at (9,2). After getting the key, I might need to use it to unlock the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can't make walls passable, I might need to find another way around. Maybe there's a path above or below the walls. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the walls, they go from y=1 to y=5 at x=4. So, above y=5, there's no wall, but the win condition is at y=5. Hmm, that's tricky. Maybe I can climb up to y=5 and then move right.

Wait, the win condition is at (9,5), which is above the walls. So, if I can get to y=5, I can move right past x=4 since the wall at x=4, y=5 is present. So, I need to find a way to get to y=5 without being blocked.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule. The ""rule `win`"" is at (9,5). If I can move it closer, I can reach it without going all the way to (9,5). But that might require changing the win condition.

Another idea: maybe I can make ""key is win,"" so that picking up the key wins the level. That would save me from needing to reach (9,5). To do that, I need to move the ""key"" block next to an ""is"" block and a ""win"" block. Let's see where the ""key"" rule is.

The ""rule `key`"" is at (9,2). The ""key"" object is at (9,2) as well. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to an ""is"" and ""win"" rule, I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition.

So, my plan is:

1. Move towards the ""rule `wall`"" at (-1,3) to change the wall properties.
2. Make ""wall is pass"" so I can walk through walls.
3. Move right past the walls at x=4.
4. Proceed to the key at (9,2).
5. Once I have the key, move it next to an ""is"" and ""win"" rule to make ""key is win.""
6. Pick up the key to win the level.

But wait, I might not need to change the wall rule if there's another path. Let me check the map again for any gaps in the walls.

Looking at the walls, they are solid from y=1 to y=5 at x=4. So, no gaps. I need to change the wall rule to pass through.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""rule `stop`"" is at (1,4). If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop sign won't block me. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the best approach is to change the wall rule to passable. So, I'll move the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is pass.""

Let me outline the steps:

- Move up three times to reach y=3.
- Move left once to get to the ""rule `wall`"" at (-1,3).
- Then, move right to position (2,3) where there's an ""is"" rule.
- Place the ""wall"" block next to ""is"" to create ""wall is pass.""
- Now, walls are passable, so I can move right through x=4.
- Move right until I reach x=9, then up to y=2 to get the key.
- Once I have the key, I can move it next to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to make ""key is win.""
- Finally, pick up the key to win.

But wait, after changing the wall rule, I need to make sure I can still move. Let me check if changing ""wall is pass"" affects my movement. Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I should still be able to move normally.

Another consideration: after making walls passable, I can walk through them, but I need to ensure that the path to the key is clear. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting at (0,0).
- Walls at x=4, y=1 to y=5.
- By making walls passable, I can walk through x=4.
- So, I can move right to x=4, then up or down as needed.

Wait, but the walls are at x=4, so moving right to x=4 would take me into the wall. If walls are passable, I can move through them. So, I can move right to x=4, then continue right to x=9.

Alternatively, I can move up first to y=5, then right past x=4 since the wall at (4,5) is passable.

I think moving up to y=5 first might be safer, as there's a wall at (4,5). So, I'll move up to y=5, then right to x=9.

Once I'm at (9,5), I can move down to (9,2) to get the key. But wait, the key is at (9,2), which is below. So, I need to move down from (9,5) to (9,2).

After getting the key, I need to make ""key is win."" So, I'll move the ""key"" rule next to an ""is"" and ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at (9,5), and there's an ""is"" rule nearby. So, I can position the ""key"" rule between ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""

Once that's done, picking up the key will trigger the win condition.

So, the steps are:

1. Move up to y=3, then left to (-1,3) to get the ""wall"" rule.
2. Move right to (2,3) and place it next to the ""is"" rule to make ""wall is pass.""
3. Move up to y=5, then right to x=9.
4. Move down to (9,2) to get the key.
5. Move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win.""
6. Pick up the key to win.

I think this should work. Now, I'll start executing these steps.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

I notice there's a ""rule `win`"" located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. To reach it, I need to figure out the path. There's also a ""rule `key`"" 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might be needed to unlock something.

I see a ""key"" object 1 step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to access the win condition. But how do I get there? There are walls in the way, so I might need to break a rule or create a new one to move through them.

The ""rule `stop`"" is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to make a wall stop moving or become passable. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make walls immovable, but that might not help me pass through.

Wait, if I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to make it ""wall is stop,"" then walls would become stoppers, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I should instead create a rule that makes walls passable, like ""wall is you,"" but that might not be necessary.

Another idea: if I can move the ""rule `is`"" blocks, I can create new rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `ball`"" to create a new rule that affects the ball, but I'm not sure how that would help me reach the win condition.

Let me think about the positions. The win is 9 right and 4 up. The key is 9 right and 1 up. So, if I can get to the key first, maybe I can use it to unlock the win. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move some walls or change their properties.

Looking at the walls, they're placed at various positions. If I can make a wall into something else, like ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, I could make ""wall is push"" to push them aside, but I don't see a ""push"" rule either.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the ball into a tool, like ""ball is push,"" then I can push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I can move around, maybe I can go around the walls. Let me check the layout. The walls are at 4 right and various up/down positions. If I move up and right, maybe I can find a path.

I see that the ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I move that, I can change what Baba is. For example, making ""baba is key"" would let me pick up the key directly. But I'm not sure if that's the best move.

Alternatively, I could make ""baba is win"" to win immediately, but that might not be the intended solution.

Wait, the key is 1 step up. If I can move the key's rule to make it ""key is you,"" then I can control the key and move it to the win condition. But I need to get to the key first.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on moving towards the key. Let me plan the path. Starting from my position, I need to move right 9 steps and up 1 step. But walls are in the way. Maybe I can move some walls or change their properties to clear the path.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, I see that the ""rule `is`"" is at 2 right and 2 up. If I move that to make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop moving, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I could move the ""rule `is`"" to make ""stop is nothing,"" which would remove the stop effect from walls, making them passable. That might be a good idea.

So, my plan is: move the ""rule `is`"" at 2 right and 2 up to make ""stop is nothing."" That would remove the stop property from walls, allowing me to pass through them. Then, I can move right and up to reach the key and then the win condition.

But wait, I need to make sure that moving that rule doesn't have unintended consequences. If ""stop is nothing,"" then any stop rules would be nullified, which might help me pass through walls.

Alternatively, I could move the ""rule `stop`"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but that would make walls stop me, which is the opposite of what I want.

No, better to make ""stop is nothing."" So, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the ""stop"" rule. Let me see where they are. The ""rule `stop`"" is 1 right and 3 up. The ""rule `is`"" is 2 right and 2 up. If I move the ""is"" rule up one step, it would align with the ""stop"" rule, creating ""stop is nothing.""

Yes, that seems like a good move. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule up to combine with ""stop,"" making ""stop is nothing."" Then, walls won't stop me, and I can move through them.

After that, I can move right and up to reach the key and then the win condition. So, the first action is to move the ""is"" rule up.

The initial position isn't specified, but based on the objects, I'm probably near the bottom since the key is one step down from somewhere.

I see a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right."" That might mean that the key is defined by a rule, and if I can move that rule, I could change what the key does or how it's defined. Similarly, there's a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe the ball has some property that could be useful.

The ""rule `stop`"" is one step to the right and two steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to make something stop or start moving. But I need to be careful because stopping might prevent me from moving.

I also see ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down."" That could be important. If I move that rule, I might change what Baba is or isn't. Since ""baba is you"" is the active rule, changing Baba's properties could affect my abilities.

The ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and three steps down. If I can manipulate that, I might change what ""you"" is, which could alter how I interact with the level.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to either change my properties or the properties of other objects to reach the win condition. Maybe I can make the key into something else or make the walls passable.

Let me plan my steps. I need to move towards the key, but walls might be in the way. If I can move a ""rule `stop`"" or ""rule `wall`"" to make the walls stop being walls, I could pass through. Alternatively, I could try to make myself into a different object that can pass through walls.

Looking at the rules, if I can move the ""rule `wall`"" to a different position, I might redefine what a wall is. For example, if I move it to say ""wall is stop,"" that could make walls immovable, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, if I can move the ""rule `is`"" blocks, I can create new rules. For instance, if I move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""key"" and ""you,"" I could make ""key is you,"" which might let me pick up the key or use it in a different way.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might allow me to interact with locks or other objects that require the key.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key and see if I can manipulate the rules around it. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key and the rules associated with it.

So, I'll choose to move right to start getting closer to the key and the relevant rules. That way, I can begin rearranging them to create a new rule that helps me progress.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up."" So, the win condition is 8 steps right and 3 up from my current position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can get there by moving through the map.

I also notice a ""key"" object located 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Keys are often used to unlock doors or change rules, so that might be useful. There's a ""ball"" 1 step right and 2 up, which might be movable or have some property.

The walls are all over the place, but I can move through them if I change the rules. For example, if I can make Baba not stop at walls, I can pass through them. The rule ""stop"" is 2 steps up, so if I can move that rule or change it, I might be able to make walls passable.

I also see a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 3 up, which is close to the win condition. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can form a new rule like ""ball is win"" or something else creative.

Let me think about the path. To get to the win condition at 8 right and 3 up, I need to move right 8 times and up 3 times. But there are walls in the way. If I can make walls not stop me, that would help. Alternatively, I could try to move the win condition closer.

Another idea: if I can make the key into something else, like ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level. The key is 1 left and 1 down, which is closer than the win condition. So maybe that's a better target.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. The key is at 1 left and 1 down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down towards the key.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule would require me to move it step by step. Each move I make can only move one step in a direction. So, I need to plan a path to get the ""is"" rule next to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key up to where the ""is"" rule is. The key is at 1 left and 1 down. If I can move it up 4 steps and right 8 steps, it would be next to the ""is"" rule. But that seems complicated.

Another approach: maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. The ball is at 1 right and 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule left 6 steps and down 1 step to get next to the ball.

But moving the ""is"" rule that far would take a lot of steps, and I might get blocked by walls. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, I also see a ""rule `baba`"" at 2 left and 3 down. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might let me unlock something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" which would mean that wherever I am, I win. But that might not be possible because the win condition is defined elsewhere.

Let me think about the walls. If I can change the rule so that walls are not stop, I can walk through them. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away or change it, that would help.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, making ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Maybe I can change it to something else.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the wall, making ""wall is you,"" which would make the walls moveable. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to move towards the win condition step by step, trying to see if I can get past the walls.

Looking at the map, the walls are at 3 right and 3 up, 3 right and 2 up, etc. So, moving right might be blocked. Maybe I should try moving up first to get around.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me try to move up to see if I can get closer to the win condition without hitting walls.

If I move up, I might hit a wall. But if I can change the rules first, I can pass through. So, maybe I should first try to change the rules to make walls passable.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the wall and change the rule. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. The walls are at 3 right and 3 up, among others. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule to 3 right and 3 up, making ""wall is you,"" which would mean walls are me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. If I move it somewhere else, the walls won't stop me anymore.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule down or right, then the walls won't have the stop property anymore. That would allow me to walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. I can move it down or right. Let's say I move it down. Each move command moves it one step. So, I can move it down step by step until it's no longer next to the wall.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be next to it and then move it. So, I need to navigate to where the ""stop"" rule is.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. So, from my starting position, I can move up twice to reach it. But are there walls blocking me? The walls are at 3 right and 3 up, etc. So, moving up might be possible.

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 3 up, which is diagonally up-right from me. So, moving straight up might not hit a wall immediately. Let me try moving up.

If I move up, I can get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Once I'm next to it, I can move it down to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So, my plan is:

1. Move up to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Then, I can move through walls to reach the win condition.

But wait, moving the ""stop"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it. So, I need to navigate to it without hitting walls. Let me see the path.

From my starting position, moving up once would take me to 0 right, 1 up. Moving up again would take me to 0 right, 2 up, which is where the ""stop"" rule is. So, I can move up twice to reach it.

But are there walls in the way? The walls are at 3 right and 3 up, so moving up twice should be clear. So, I can move up twice, then move the ""stop"" rule down.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't stop me anymore. Then, I can move right and up to reach the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the side, making ""stop is something else,"" but I think just moving it away would be enough.

So, the first step is to move up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, move it down to break the rule.

But wait, each action is just one step. So, I need to plan each move carefully.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move up to get closer to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move up again to reach the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the ""stop"" rule down once.
4. Now, the ""stop"" rule is no longer next to the wall, so walls are passable.
5. Then, I can move right and up to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule down doesn't create a new rule that's problematic. For example, if I move it down next to another object, it might form a new rule like ""something is stop,"" which could cause issues.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to an empty space, so it doesn't form a new rule.

So, moving the ""stop"" rule down from 2 up to 1 up, then to 0 up, etc., as long as it's not next to any other rule or object.

Once that's done, the walls won't stop me, and I can move freely.

After that, I can head towards the win condition at 8 right and 3 up. But that's still a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path or another rule I can exploit.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the win condition closer. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level.

The key is at 1 left and 1 down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key, I can create ""key is win.""

The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. The key is at 1 left and 1 down. That's a distance of 8 right and 4 up. That's too far to move the ""is"" rule in one go.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key up to where the ""is"" rule is. The key is at 1 left and 1 down. If I can move it up 4 steps and right 8 steps, it would be next to the ""is"" rule. But that's a lot of steps, and I might get blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule left and down towards the key. Each move command can only move it one step, so I need to plan a path.

But this seems time-consuming. Maybe it's better to just make walls passable and go straight to the win condition.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am, I win. But I don't see a way to do that immediately.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 3 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, making ""baba is win,"" that would solve the level. But the ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up, so moving it left 9 steps and down 6 steps is impractical.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to me. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 3 up. If I can move it left 8 steps and down 3 steps, it would be next to me, making ""baba is win."" But again, that's a lot of steps.

Hmm, maybe the simplest solution is to make walls passable and then move to the win condition.

So, to recap:

1. Move up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Then, move right and up to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't create a new problematic rule. For example, if I move it down next to a wall, it might become ""wall is stop"" again, which I don't want.

So, I should move the ""stop"" rule to an empty space, maybe down and to the side where there are no other rules or objects.

Once that's done, I can move freely through walls.

After that, I can head towards the win condition. Since the win condition is at 8 right and 3 up, I can move right 8 times and up 3 times, passing through any walls since they no longer stop me.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path or another rule I can exploit once walls are passable.

Another thought: the ""ball"" is at 1 right and 2 up. Maybe it has some property that can help. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. But I'd need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball.

The ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. The ball is at 1 right and 2 up. So, moving the ""is"" rule left 6 steps and down 1 step would position it next to the ball, creating ""ball is win.""

But that's a lot of steps, and I might get blocked by walls. Maybe it's better to just go for the win condition directly once walls are passable.

So, my plan is:

1. Move up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down to an empty space, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Move right 8 steps and up 3 steps to reach the win condition, passing through walls since they no longer stop me.

I think this is the most straightforward approach. Let's try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need the key for something? There's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 1 step up. I wonder if the ball is part of a rule I can use.

I notice there are several walls and rules scattered around. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up, others down. The rules include ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I need to see if I can manipulate these rules to help me reach the win.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, I might make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the ""key"" is nearby. If I can get the key, maybe it can unlock something. But how? There's a ""rule `key`"" 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe if I move the key rule next to the key object, I can make the key do something. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" to make the key the win condition, which would make it easier to win.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a different object, I might not have to go all the way to the current win position. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get closer to the key or the ball. Right now, I'm at the starting position. The ball is 1 step right and 1 up, which is close. The key is a bit further, 1 left and 2 down. Maybe I can move towards the ball first.

But wait, moving towards the ball might not help unless I can use it in a rule. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ball, I can create a new rule like ""ball is you,"" making the ball controllable. Then I could use the ball to reach the win.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then just being Baba would win the level, but that might not be possible since the rule is already ""baba is you.""

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the win condition. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule to the ball. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block next to the ball. The ""win"" rule is 8 right and 2 up, while the ball is 1 right and 1 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move the ball rule instead.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 4 steps to the right. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ball, I can create ""ball is win."" That would make the ball the win condition. Then I just need to reach the ball.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move them if they're not stopped by ""stop"" rules. Let me check if there are any ""stop"" rules near the ""ball"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up. So if I move up, I might hit the stop rule. Hmm, maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball to create a new rule. If I can get ""ball is win,"" that would help. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right. So if I move right, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can pick it up and move it next to the ball.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right to get next to the ""is"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule.
3. Move towards the ball, placing the ""is"" rule next to it to create ""ball is win.""
4. Then, move to the ball to win.

But I need to make sure I can move without hitting any walls or stop rules. Let me check the walls. There are walls to the right and up, so I might need to go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the key is. If I can make ""key is win,"" then getting the key would win the level.

But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe it's easier to manipulate the ""ball"" rule.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 left and 2 down. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something else. But I'm not sure what the key does yet.

I think the best approach is to try to make ""ball is win."" So I'll move right to get the ""is"" rule, then move it next to the ball.

Let me try moving right first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up."" So, the win condition is at (7 right, 2 up). That's my target.

Next, I should look at the other rules. There's ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 1 step up,"" which probably means that if I move that rule, I can change what stops movement. Also, there's a ""rule `ball` 3 steps to the right,"" which might affect how the ball behaves.

I also notice a ""key"" at (2 left, 2 down). Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. The ball is at (1 up), so it's somewhere near me.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to avoid walls unless I can change the rules to make them passable. Let me see if I can move any rules to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or change their properties.

Looking at the rules, I can move the ""rule `stop`"" to change what stops me. If I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall IS push"" or something else.

But first, I need to get to the win condition. Let me plan the path. The win is at (7 right, 2 up). I'm currently at (0,0), so moving right 7 and up 2 would get me there, but there are walls in the way.

I see walls at (2 right, 2 up), (2 right, 1 up), (2 right), (2 right, 1 down), (2 right, 2 down), and (2 right, 3 down). So, the path to the right is blocked by walls. I need to find a way around or through them.

Maybe I can move some rules to change the walls' properties. For example, if I can make walls into something else, like ""wall IS air,"" they would disappear. But I don't see a rule for ""air"" here. Alternatively, I could make walls into ""push"" so I can push them aside.

Looking at the rules, I can move the ""rule `is`"" blocks. There's a ""rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" which is part of the ""win"" rule. If I move that, I might break the ""win"" rule, which I don't want to do. So, I need to be careful.

Another approach is to use the ball. The ball is at (1 up). Maybe I can push the ball to break through walls or reach the win condition. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with the rules yet.

Wait, there's a ""rule `ball` 3 steps to the right."" If I move that, I can change how the ball behaves. Maybe I can make the ball into a ""WIN"" object or something else useful.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" to change what stops me. If I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them. For example, moving the ""rule `stop`"" to say ""wall IS stop"" would mean walls stop me, but if I change it, maybe I can make them not stop.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""rule `is`"" near the walls to create a new rule. For example, if I move a ""rule `is`"" next to a wall and a ""push"" word, I can make walls pushable.

Wait, I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Maybe I need to create it. Alternatively, I can make walls into something else, like ""wall IS air,"" but I don't have an ""air"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on the key. The key is at (2 left, 2 down). If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks something. But I'm not sure what's locked.

Alternatively, I can try to reach the win condition by moving up and right, but the walls are in the way. Maybe I can go around. Let me see the layout:

- Walls are at (2 right, 2 up), (2 right, 1 up), (2 right), (2 right, 1 down), (2 right, 2 down), (2 right, 3 down).

So, the walls form a vertical line at 2 right, blocking my path. I need to go around them. Maybe I can go up first, then right.

If I move up, I can go to (0,1), then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (2 right, 1 up), which is (2,1). So, I can't go right beyond that.

Alternatively, I can go down first. If I move down, I can go to (0,-1), then right. But I see walls at (2 right, 1 down), which is (2,-1), so that's blocked too.

Wait, maybe I can move the ball to break through walls. The ball is at (1 up), which is (0,1). If I push the ball right, it might move through walls if I can change the rules.

But I need to create a rule that allows the ball to break walls. Maybe I can make the ball into a ""break"" object.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `ball`"" to change its behavior. The ""rule `ball`"" is at (3 right, 1 up). If I move it to say ""ball IS break,"" then the ball can break walls.

But I don't see a ""break"" rule here. Maybe I can create it by moving other rules.

Wait, I have a ""rule `key`"" at (7 right, 1 down). If I can get the key, maybe it can help me unlock something.

But I'm stuck because the walls are blocking my path. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Let me try to move a ""rule `is`"" next to a wall and a ""push"" word. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, I can make walls into ""air"" by moving a ""rule `is`"" next to a wall and an ""air"" word, but I don't have an ""air"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make walls into ""you,"" so I can walk through them. If I can make ""wall IS you,"" then walls would be me, and I can pass through them.

But I don't see a ""you"" rule near the walls. The ""rule `you`"" is at (1 left, 4 down). Maybe I can move it next to a wall.

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `is`"" next to a wall and the ""you"" rule to create ""wall IS you.""

But that might be complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to move the ""rule `stop`"" to change what stops me. If I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them.

The ""rule `stop`"" is at (1 left, 1 up). If I move it to say ""wall IS stop,"" that would mean walls stop me, which is the default. But I want to make walls not stop me, so maybe I can move it to say ""wall IS not stop.""

But I don't see a ""not"" rule here. Alternatively, I can remove the ""stop"" rule by moving it away, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving it. If I move the ""rule `stop`"" away from the wall, then walls won't stop me anymore.

So, the ""rule `stop`"" is at (1 left, 1 up). If I move it to a different location, the rule ""wall IS stop"" would be broken, and walls wouldn't stop me.

That sounds promising. So, my plan is:

1. Move the ""rule `stop`"" from (1 left, 1 up) to a new location, breaking the ""wall IS stop"" rule.
2. Once walls don't stop me, I can walk through them to reach the win condition.

But how do I move the ""rule `stop`""? I need to move it by pushing it with Baba. Since I'm Baba, I can move it by moving into it.

So, I need to get next to the ""rule `stop`"" at (1 left, 1 up). Currently, I'm at (0,0). To get to (1 left, 1 up), I need to move left once and up once.

But moving left from (0,0) would take me to (-1,0), but I don't see any walls there. Wait, the walls are at (2 right, ...), so moving left is possible.

So, I can move left to (-1,0), then up to (-1,1), which is where the ""rule `stop`"" is.

Once I'm at (-1,1), I can push the ""rule `stop`"" to a new location, say (0,1), breaking the rule.

After that, walls won't stop me, and I can walk through them to reach the win condition at (7 right, 2 up).

So, the steps are:

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. Move up to (-1,1) to be next to the ""rule `stop`"".
3. Move right to (0,1), pushing the ""rule `stop`"" to (0,1), breaking the ""wall IS stop"" rule.
4. Now, walls don't stop me, so I can move right through them.
5. Move right to (7,2) to reach the win condition.

But wait, after breaking the ""stop"" rule, I need to make sure that the walls don't stop me. So, I can proceed to move right through the walls.

Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls, but breaking the ""stop"" rule should suffice.

So, the first action is to move left to get next to the ""rule `stop`"".

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's probably the target I need to reach. But to get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I see several walls positioned around the map. For example, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is right in the path towards the win condition. There are also other walls at various positions, some with rules attached like ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `stop`."" These might affect how I can move or interact with the environment.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. I remember that in Baba Is You, the ball can sometimes be used to push objects or break them. Maybe I can use the ball to clear a path or change some rules.

There's also a key 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Keys are usually used to unlock doors or change certain properties, so perhaps I need to collect it to proceed further.

The rules section shows that there are several ""is"" rules, which define what objects are. For example, ""rule `is` 2 steps to the right"" might mean that moving the ""is"" block can change the properties of other objects. If I can manipulate these rules, I might be able to change how Baba or other objects behave.

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 4 steps down. This suggests that moving these rules could change what Baba is or how the win condition is defined. Maybe if I move the ""baba"" rule next to something else, I can make Baba into a different object, which could help me overcome obstacles.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up, which probably means that whatever is under that rule can't be moved. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away or change it, I might be able to move previously immovable objects.

I also see a ""key"" rule 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. Collecting the key might unlock something, but I'm not sure what yet. Maybe it's needed to access the win condition or change a rule.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ball to see if I can use it to break through walls or change rules. Alternatively, I might need to manipulate the ""is"" rules to redefine what Baba is, making it possible to pass through walls or move in a different way.

Let me try moving right to get closer to the ball. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will break the wall, creating a path. Alternatively, moving the ball into an ""is"" rule could change the ball's properties, making it more useful.

Another option is to move up to see if there's a way to access the ""is"" rules directly. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to a wall, I might be able to change the wall's properties, making it passable or removable.

I also need to be cautious of the walls and ensure I don't get trapped. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, so I need to find a way around or through them.

In summary, my plan is to move towards the ball, use it to break walls or change rules, and then proceed towards the win condition. Alternatively, I might need to manipulate the rules directly to redefine Baba's properties or change the win condition.

I think the best first step is to move right to get closer to the ball and see what options I have from there.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up."" So, the win condition is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up from my current position. That's quite a distance, and there are walls in the way, so I might need to break through or find a way around.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object located 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Keys in Baba Is You usually unlock doors or change something, so maybe I need to pick that up. But to get the key, I have to move left and down, which might take me away from the win condition. I need to see if that's necessary.

There's a ""ball"" 1 step up. Balls can sometimes be used to push things or change the environment. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition or move some rules around.

The rules themselves are important. I see ""rule `is`"" in multiple places, which are the connectors in the game. If I can rearrange these, I can create new rules. For example, if I move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `win`,"" I might be able to change what counts as winning.

I also see ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can make something ""stop,"" it might block certain paths or prevent me from moving through areas. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The walls are everywhere, but I can move them if they're not ""stop"" or another immovable property. I need to check if any walls are movable. From the observation, it doesn't specify, so I'll assume they're all movable unless stated otherwise.

My plan is to first move towards the key to see if it's necessary. If I can get the key, maybe it'll unlock something that helps me reach the win condition. Alternatively, I can try to move some rules around to change the win condition or make the path easier.

Looking at the key's position, it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down. That's a bit of a detour, but maybe it's worth it. Alternatively, I can try to move some walls or rules to create a path towards the win.

Another idea is to create a new rule that makes the ball or another object ""WIN."" If I can make the ball the win condition, I might not need to go all the way to the current win position. But I need to see if that's possible with the rules I have.

I also notice that the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 4 steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change what Baba is, which could give me new abilities or properties.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. If I can combine that with something else, maybe I can change who controls what. But I'm not sure how that would help right now.

Let me think about the immediate steps. I'm currently at a position where I can move up, right, down, or left. The key is down and left, but the win is up and right. Maybe I should try to move towards the win first and see if I can clear the path.

Alternatively, moving towards the key might unlock something that makes the win easier. I'm a bit stuck, but I think moving towards the key is a good start. Let me try moving left to get closer to the key.

Wait, the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So from my current position, I need to move left twice and down twice. But I'm not sure if that's the best path. Maybe I can move down first to get closer to the key.

Alternatively, I can move right towards the win and see if I can break through the walls. If I can move some walls, I might create a path. Let me check the walls around me. There's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that wall down to create space.

But I don't know if I can move walls yet. I need to see if any rules allow me to do that. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba, but walls might be immovable unless I change the rules.

Hmm, maybe I should try to move a ""rule `is`"" next to a wall to make it movable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is you,"" but that might not be helpful.

Wait, I see a ""rule `ball`"" 3 steps to the right. If I can make the ball ""WIN,"" then maybe I can just reach the ball instead of the current win condition. Let me see how to do that.

I need to move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `ball`"" and then next to ""rule `win`."" So, I can create a new rule like ""ball is win."" That way, reaching the ball would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" that's 1 step to the right next to the ""rule `ball`"" which is 3 steps to the right. So, I can move right twice to get the ""rule `is`"" next to the ""rule `ball`,"" then move up or down to place it correctly.

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `ball`"" next to the ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`."" But that might be more complicated.

Let me try moving right twice to get the ""rule `is`"" next to the ""rule `ball`."" That would create ""ball is"" and then I can move the ""rule `win`"" next to that to make ""ball is win.""

But I need to check if that's possible. The ""rule `win`"" is 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's quite far, so maybe it's not feasible right now.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `win`"" closer. But that might require moving multiple rules, which could take time.

Maybe a better approach is to move towards the key first. If I can get the key, perhaps it'll unlock a door or change something that makes the win condition easier.

So, I'll try moving left to get closer to the key. Let me move left once. Now, I'm one step left. Next, I can move left again to get to the key's column. Then, I can move down twice to reach the key.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. From the observation, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, but I'm moving left, so maybe I can avoid it.

Wait, the key is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So, from my current position, I need to move left twice and down twice. Let me do that step by step.

First, move left once. Now, I'm at position (current x -1, current y). Next, move left again to reach x-2. Then, move down once to y-1, and again to y-2. That should get me to the key.

But I need to check if there are any walls in that path. The observation mentions walls at various positions, but I don't see one directly in my path. So, I think it's safe to move left twice and down twice to get the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something or change a rule. For example, if there's a locked door, the key might open it, but I don't see a door mentioned. Alternatively, the key might allow me to pick up a rule or change a property.

After getting the key, I can then plan my next move towards the win condition. Maybe the key is necessary to change the win rule or to move some walls.

Alternatively, if the key isn't necessary, I can proceed towards the win directly. But I think it's better to get the key first in case it's needed.

So, my plan is to move left twice and down twice to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I'll reassess the situation and decide the next steps.

But wait, the key is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. Let me make sure I'm moving correctly. From my current position, moving left twice would take me to x-2, and moving down twice would take me to y-2. That should be where the key is.

I think that's the best course of action for now. I'll move left to start heading towards the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, it's 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, it's somewhere on the upper right part of the map. To get there, I might need to move through the map, possibly rearranging some rules along the way.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object. It's 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. There's a ""ball"" that's 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Maybe the ball can be used to change rules or move certain objects.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I move the ""win"" rule next to something else, I can change what counts as winning.

I should consider moving the ""win"" rule closer to me or to a more accessible location. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes another object the win condition, which might be easier to reach.

Another thought: the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move that, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving or affecting me. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

I also see multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can use them to create new subjects or properties. For example, if I place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""you,"" that's the current rule. But if I move ""is"" elsewhere, I can make other things ""you"" or ""win.""

Let me think about the key. It's 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps the key is used to modify a rule.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can push the ball to move it into a position where it can trigger a rule change. Or perhaps the ball can be used to reach higher places.

Looking at the walls, they're positioned in a way that might block my path. If I can move a wall, I can create a new path. But walls are usually ""stop"" objects, so they can't be moved unless I change their properties.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I move that, I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then walls can be pushed. That might help me move them out of the way.

Alternatively, if I make ""wall is you,"" then I can control the walls, which could be useful for creating bridges or moving obstacles.

But I need to be careful because changing rules can have unintended consequences. For example, if I make ""baba is stop,"" I might get stuck.

Let me outline a possible plan:

1. Move towards the key to pick it up. It's 1 step left and 2 steps down from my current position. So, I need to go left once and down twice.

2. Once I have the key, see if I can use it to modify a rule. Maybe the key can be used to unlock a rule or change the win condition.

3. Alternatively, use the ball to create a new rule. If I can push the ball into a position where it's next to an ""is"" rule, I can make ""ball is win"" or something similar.

4. Another option is to move the ""win"" rule closer to me. It's currently 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move it to a more accessible location, I can reach it more easily.

5. Check if there are any other rules that can be modified to make the level easier. For example, making ""baba is jump"" would allow me to jump over walls, but I don't see a ""jump"" rule present.

6. If I can't reach the win directly, maybe I can create a new win condition. For example, making ""key is win"" would mean picking up the key would win the level.

Let me try to move towards the key first. From my current position, I need to go left once and down twice. So, the first move would be left.

But wait, I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The walls are positioned at various steps, but I'm not sure if they're in the way. If there's a wall in the path, I might need to move it or find another way.

Alternatively, if moving left and down is blocked, I might need to find another route. Maybe moving up first to get around the walls.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move it to a position that's easier to reach, that would solve the problem.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule. It's currently 8 steps right and 2 steps up. I can move it by pushing it with another object or by rearranging the rules.

Wait, I can only move objects that are not ""stop."" So, if the ""win"" rule is on a ""stop"" object, I can't move it. But I don't see a ""stop"" rule applied to it, so maybe I can move it.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes ""win"" movable. For example, if I make ""win is push,"" then I can push it.

But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create one by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""push.""

Wait, I don't see a ""push"" rule in the current rules. So, that might not be possible.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I go, I win. But that might not be the intended solution.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is win,"" so picking up the key would win the level. That could be a way to bypass the need to reach the ""win"" object directly.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me try to move towards the key first. If I can pick it up, maybe it will help me change a rule.

So, my first move would be to go left once to get closer to the key. Then, down twice to reach it.

But I need to check if there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, but I'm not sure if they block my path. If there's a wall, I might need to move it or find another way.

Alternatively, if moving left is blocked, I might need to go up first to get around.

This is a bit tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move it to a position that's easier to reach, that would solve the problem.

To move the ""win"" rule, I need to have it adjacent to an ""is"" rule and a subject. So, I can rearrange it to make a new rule.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is already a subject. So, maybe I can move it to make ""win is something else.""

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes another object the win condition.

I think the best course of action is to move towards the key first. Let's try that.

So, I'll move left once to get closer to the key. Then, down twice to reach it.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. If there's a wall, I might need to move it or find another way.

Alternatively, if moving left is blocked, I might need to go up first to get around.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving left first and see what happens.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up."" So, the win condition is 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up from my current position. That's pretty far to the right.

I also notice there's a ""key"" object. It's 2 steps down. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. I wonder if the ball is part of the solution or just an obstacle.

The rules are important here. I can move the rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can change what ""is"" means. But I have to be careful because some rules might make walls stop me or change how I move.

I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. Walls are placed at various points, so I need to find a path around them. The ""WIN"" is far to the right, so I probably need to move right multiple times. But there are walls blocking the way, so I might need to break through them by changing the rules.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can change that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

I also see a ""key"" 2 steps down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock a door or something. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the key is part of a rule that I can use to change the win condition.

Let me think about the rules I can manipulate. There's a ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up."" If I move that closer, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""WIN,"" I can make ""WIN"" something else, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, I can try to make myself into something else. For example, if I can make ""BABA is BALL,"" then I can push the ball or use it in some way. But I need to see if the ball is movable or if it's just an obstacle.

Wait, the ball is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can create a new rule like ""BALL is YOU,"" which would let me control the ball. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Another idea: if I can make ""WIN is KEY,"" then maybe the key becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the case. I need to see where the key is and how it's positioned.

The key is 2 steps down. If I can move down, I can pick it up. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. For example, if I can make ""WALL is NOT STOP,"" then I can walk through walls. That would be really helpful because it would let me bypass the walls blocking my path to the win.

So, how can I do that? I need to move the ""stop"" rule and the ""wall"" rule next to each other to create a new rule. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, and the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule between them, I can create ""WALL is STOP"" or ""STOP is WALL."" But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""WIN"" to change the win condition. For example, if I make ""WIN is KEY,"" then I need to get the key to win. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. I need to move right multiple times to reach the win. But walls are in the way. If I can make walls passable, that would solve the problem. So, I need to find a way to change the wall's properties.

I see a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" If I can move the ""is"" rule next to this, I can create a new rule like ""STOP is NOT WALL"" or something similar. But I'm not sure how to structure that.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule and another rule to create a new rule that modifies the wall's stop property. For example, if I can make ""WALL is NOT STOP,"" then walls won't stop me.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule next to a wall rule. The wall rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule next to it, I can create ""WALL is NOT STOP.""

But how do I move the rules? I can only move them if they're not defined as ""STOP."" Since the ""stop"" rule is just a rule, I can move it. So, I can move the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right to get closer to the rules. I need to get to the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps to the right.

2. Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up and move it next to the ""stop"" rule and the ""wall"" rule.

3. By placing ""is"" between ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I can create a new rule: ""WALL is NOT STOP."" This would mean walls no longer stop me.

4. Once walls are passable, I can move right through them to reach the win.

But wait, I need to make sure I'm moving the rules correctly. Let me visualize the positions:

- I'm starting at (0,0).

- The ""is"" rule I can move is 3 steps to the right, so at (3,0).

- The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so at (1,1).

- The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up, so at (-1,1).

So, to create ""WALL is NOT STOP,"" I need to arrange the rules so that ""wall"" is connected to ""is"" and ""not stop.""

But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so maybe I can just make ""WALL is STOP"" and then negate it somehow. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""STOP is NOT WALL,"" but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""YOU is WALL,"" which would let me become a wall and push through other walls. But that might not be necessary.

Another approach: if I can make ""WIN is KEY,"" then I need to get the key to win. The key is 2 steps down, so I need to move down twice. But there are walls blocking the way down. So, I might need to change the rules to make walls passable first.

Wait, the key is 2 steps down, but there are walls at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, and 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So, the path down is blocked by walls. Therefore, I need to make walls passable to get to the key.

So, the priority is to make walls passable. Let's focus on that.

I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""WALL is NOT STOP."" But how?

I can move the ""is"" rule from (3,0) to (1,1), where the ""stop"" rule is. Then, I can move the ""stop"" rule to (-1,1), where the ""wall"" rule is. But I'm not sure if that's the right way.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to (-1,1), next to the ""wall"" rule, and then move the ""stop"" rule next to it to form ""WALL is STOP."" But I want to negate that, so maybe ""WALL is NOT STOP.""

Wait, maybe I can create ""STOP is NOT WALL."" If I can make ""STOP is NOT WALL,"" then walls won't stop me. So, I need to arrange the rules so that ""stop"" is connected to ""is"" and ""not wall.""

But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so maybe I can just make ""STOP is WALL"" and then break it somehow. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""YOU is STOP,"" which would make me stop, but that doesn't help.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see if I can make ""WIN is KEY"" so that I can win by getting the key. The key is 2 steps down, but walls are blocking the way. So, I need to make walls passable first.

Wait, maybe I can make ""KEY is WIN."" Then, picking up the key would make me win. But I need to see if that's possible.

The ""key"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule. But that's far away, and I can't move through walls yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""WIN is YOU,"" which would mean I win wherever I am, but that's not helpful.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. If I can make ""YOU is WIN,"" then wherever I am, I win. But I don't see a ""you"" rule nearby.

Looking back, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. That's far away. So, that's not helpful right now.

Let me get back to making walls passable. I think that's the key to moving forward.

I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. So, I'll start by moving right to get to the ""is"" rule at (3,0). Then, I'll pick it up and move it to (1,1), where the ""stop"" rule is. Then, I'll move the ""stop"" rule to (-1,1), where the ""wall"" rule is. This way, I can create ""WALL is STOP,"" but I want to negate it. Maybe I can break the rule somehow.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to (-1,1) next to the ""wall"" rule, and then move the ""stop"" rule next to it to form ""WALL is STOP."" But I want walls to not stop me, so maybe I can make ""WALL is NOT STOP.""

But without a ""not"" rule, I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can just remove the ""stop"" property from walls by breaking the existing rule.

Wait, the initial rule is ""baba is you."" If I can make ""WALL is NOT STOP,"" then walls won't stop me. But how?

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""stop"" rule away. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then break the rule by moving one of them. But I'm not sure how that works.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and see what happens. Let's say I move the ""is"" rule from (3,0) to (-1,1), next to the ""wall"" rule. Then, I can create ""WALL is [something]."" If I can make ""WALL is NOT STOP,"" that would solve the problem.

But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so maybe I can just make ""WALL is [empty],"" which would remove the stop property. I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""WALL is YOU,"" which would let me control walls, but that might not help.

Wait, if I can make ""WALL is YOU,"" then I can move walls, which might help me clear a path. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to try to make walls passable by modifying their stop property. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""stop"" rule away or modify it.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right three times to reach the ""is"" rule at (3,0).

2. Pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to (-1,1), next to the ""wall"" rule.

3. Now, the rule becomes ""WALL is [something]."" I need to make it ""WALL is NOT STOP.""

4. To do that, I might need to move the ""stop"" rule away or break the existing rule.

But I'm not sure how to negate the stop property. Maybe I can just remove the ""stop"" rule from the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then break it by moving one of them.

Wait, if I have ""WALL is STOP,"" and I move the ""stop"" rule away, does that remove the stop property from walls? Maybe.

So, after moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, I can move the ""stop"" rule away, which would break the ""WALL is STOP"" rule, making walls passable.

Let me try that.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right three times to get to the ""is"" rule at (3,0).

2. Move up once to pick up the ""is"" rule.

3. Move left four times to get to (-1,1), where the ""wall"" rule is.

4. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, creating ""WALL is [empty].""

Wait, but I need to connect it to something. Maybe I can then move the ""stop"" rule next to it to make ""WALL is STOP,"" and then move the ""stop"" rule away to break it.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall rule.

But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: if I can make ""YOU is BALL,"" then I can control the ball and use it to push through walls or something. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, so at (2,1). If I can make ""BALL is YOU,"" I can move the ball and see if it interacts with walls differently.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. I think making walls passable is the priority.

Wait, maybe I can make ""WIN is KEY"" so that I can win by picking up the key. The key is 2 steps down, but walls are blocking the way. So, I need to make walls passable first.

I think I'm stuck on how to make walls passable. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule away from the wall rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at (1,1). If I move it away, does that remove the stop property from walls? Maybe.

So, steps:

1. Move right once to (1,0).

2. Move up once to (1,1) to pick up the ""stop"" rule.

3. Move it somewhere else, like (1,2), to break the ""WALL is STOP"" rule.

But I'm not sure if that works. Maybe walls will no longer stop me if the ""stop"" rule is moved.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule and the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule.

Wait, if I can make ""WALL is NOT STOP,"" that would do it. But how?

I think I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""stop"" rule next to it with a ""not"" in between, but I don't see a ""not"" rule.

Maybe I can just move the ""stop"" rule away, and that would remove the stop property from walls.

So, let's try that.

1. Move right once to (1,0).

2. Move up once to (1,1) to pick up the ""stop"" rule.

3. Move it to (1,2), away from the wall rule.

Now, the ""WALL is STOP"" rule is broken, so walls no longer stop me.

Once that's done, I can move right through the walls to reach the win.

So, after moving the ""stop"" rule away, I can:

4. Move right four times to get to (4,0).

5. Move up two times to get to (4,2), which is the win condition.

Wait, but the win is at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, I need to move further right.

But after moving right four times, I'm at (4,0). I need to move right five more times to reach (9,0), then up two steps to (9,2).

But there are walls in the way. If I've made walls passable, I can move through them.

So, after step 3, I can:

4. Move right five times to (9,0).

5. Move up two times to (9,2), which is the win.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule away actually makes walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""stop"" rule away to break the rule.

I think that's the way to go. So, the key action is to move the ""stop""","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. I wonder if the ball is needed to reach the win.

I see several walls and rules scattered around. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up, which might mean that walls are blocking my path. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so maybe some objects are immovable.

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can also manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. Maybe I can change the rules to make walls passable or to redefine what ""WIN"" means.

Let me think about the key. It's 2 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock a path to the win. But how do I get to the key? There are walls in the way. Maybe I can move a rule to make the walls stop being walls.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" 3 steps to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I could make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you"" so I can control the ball and use it to reach higher places. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""you."" Let me see where those are.

The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the right. If I move it next to ""ball,"" I can create ""ball is you."" Then I can control the ball. But how do I get there? There are walls in the way.

Maybe I should first move towards the key. It's 2 steps down. Let me check if there's a clear path. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can break the wall by changing its rule. If I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" and ""wall"" next to something else.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first and see if that leads somewhere. If I move down twice, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe the key can be used to unlock the win condition.

But wait, the key is 2 steps down, and I'm currently at the starting position. Let me plan my moves. I need to go down twice to reach the key. But are there any walls blocking me? The wall is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, so maybe not directly in my path.

I think I'll try moving down twice to get the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to interact with the win condition or other objects.

So, my plan is: move down twice to get the key. Then, see if I can use the key to reach the win. If that doesn't work, I'll consider manipulating the rules further.

Let me try moving down once. That should bring me closer to the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 3 step up."" So, the win condition is at position (9 right, 3 up). That's pretty far to the right. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way.

I also notice a ""key"" object at (1 step down). Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which might mean that the key has some property defined by that rule. I'm not sure yet.

The ball is at (2 steps right, 2 up). There's also a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe the ball has some function, like pushing or something.

I can move the rules around to change properties. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. Maybe I can make Baba able to push walls or something else.

Looking at the walls, they're placed at various positions. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"" suggests that walls have the ""stop"" property, meaning they can't be moved. But maybe I can change that by rearranging the rules.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules so that I can move through the walls or change their properties. If I can make walls not stop me, I can pass through them. Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule that allows me to push walls.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the win condition at (9 right, 3 up). To get there, I might need to move right several times, but walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls so they don't block me.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is passwall"" or something like that, I could walk through walls.

But how do I create that rule? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to another property. Maybe I can take the ""is"" rule and place it next to ""win"" or ""key"" to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""rule `is` 3 steps down"" is somewhere below me. If I can move that up, I might be able to create a new rule. Let me see where I am. I'm at the starting position, which is probably (0,0). The ""is"" rule is at (3 down), so I need to move down to get it.

But moving down might take me closer to the key. The key is at (1 step down). Maybe I should pick up the key first. If I move down once, I can grab the key. Then, maybe the key can be used to unlock something else.

After picking up the key, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""key,"" I can make ""key is something."" Maybe that gives the key a new property.

Alternatively, I could move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to change Baba's properties. If I can make ""baba is push,"" I can push walls out of the way.

Let me try moving down to pick up the key. So, my first action should be ""down."" That will take me to the key's position. Once I have the key, I can see if it helps me manipulate the rules further.

After picking up the key, I can move around more freely. Maybe I can then move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me reach the win condition.

I think the key step is to first get the key, then use it in combination with moving the ""is"" rule to create a new property that allows me to overcome the walls blocking my path to the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is at position (9 right, 4 up). That's pretty far to the right and up. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way.

I also notice a ""key"" object at (1 step down). Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which might mean that the key has some property, perhaps to open a locked door or something.

The ball is at (2 steps right, 3 up). I'm not sure what the ball does yet. There's a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" so maybe the ball has some effect when moved.

I can move the rules around to change the game's mechanics. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create new rules. Maybe I can make Baba able to push walls or something.

Let me think about the path to the win. The walls are at (4 right, 4 up), (4 right, 3 up), (4 right, 2 up), (4 right, 1 up), (4 right), (4 right, 1 down), (4 right, 2 down), and (4 right, 3 down). So, there's a vertical line of walls at 4 right, from up to down. That's a big barrier.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, which is at (1 right, 3 up), maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is already applied to walls because ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" is present. So, walls are stop objects, meaning I can't move through them.

I need to find a way to either move the walls or change their properties. Maybe if I can make walls not stop me, I can pass through them. To do that, I need to create a new rule like ""wall IS NOT stop."" But how?

I can move the ""is"" rule and the ""stop"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""NOT"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall IS NOT stop."" But I don't see a ""NOT"" rule here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing ""wall IS stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, the rule might be removed. Let me check: the ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" is associated with the wall at (1 right, 3 up). If I move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere, the wall might no longer be a stop object.

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, making the walls passable. Then, I can move through them to reach the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. But how? I can only move text blocks, not walls. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule text block. It's at (1 right, 3 up). I can move it down or somewhere else.

If I move the ""stop"" rule down, say to (1 right, 2 up), then the wall at (1 right, 3 up) will no longer have the ""stop"" rule applied. That should make that wall passable. But wait, there are multiple walls. I might need to do this for each wall, which could be tedious.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that applies to all walls. If I can make ""wall IS NOT stop,"" then all walls would be passable. But I don't see a ""NOT"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""something else,"" I can redefine what walls are. For example, if I make ""wall IS push,"" then I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here either.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at (2 right, 3 up). If I can make the ball push walls, I could use it to clear a path. But I'm not sure how to do that without the necessary rules.

Let me think differently. The key is at (1 step down). Maybe I need to pick up the key first. If I move down to get the key, I can then use it to unlock something. But the walls are in the way. So, I need to get past the walls first.

Perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to jump or something. But again, without the necessary rule components, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1 right, 2 steps down). If I move it next to something else, I can change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you IS key,"" then I would become the key, which might help me unlock something.

Alternatively, if I make ""you IS ball,"" I could bounce or something. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule first. I'll move it down to (1 right, 2 up). That should remove the ""stop"" property from the wall at (1 right, 3 up), making it passable. Then, I can move right through that wall.

After moving through, I can continue moving right towards the win condition. But I need to make sure that other walls don't block me. Maybe I can repeat the process for other walls, but that might take too long.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that makes all walls passable, that would be better. But without a ""NOT"" rule, I'm not sure how.

Another approach: maybe the key is needed to change the win condition. If I pick up the key, perhaps I can redefine what ""win"" is. For example, making ""key IS win"" would mean that picking up the key would win the level.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move towards the key first. I need to get past the walls to reach it.

So, step by step:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule at (1 right, 3 up) down to (1 right, 2 up). This should make the wall at (1 right, 3 up) passable.

2. Move right through the now-passable wall.

3. Continue moving right towards the win condition at (9 right, 4 up).

But wait, there are more walls at (4 right, 4 up), (4 right, 3 up), etc. I might need to move their ""stop"" rules as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at (9 right, 4 up). If I move it left, I can make the win condition closer.

But I can't move the ""win"" rule directly; I can only move text blocks. So, I need to move the ""win"" text block to a new position.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is part of the active rules. If I move the ""win"" text block, I can change where the win condition is. For example, moving it left would make the win condition appear closer.

But I'm not sure how to do that without disrupting other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key the win condition. If I make ""key IS win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is at (9 right, 1 up), and the ""win"" rule is at (9 right, 4 up). If I move the ""is"" rule between them, I can create ""key IS win.""

But that might require precise movement, and I'm not sure if it's possible given the current layout.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule first and see if that helps.

I'll move the ""stop"" rule at (1 right, 3 up) down to (1 right, 2 up). Now, the wall at (1 right, 3 up) is no longer a stop object. I can move right through it.

After moving right, I'm at (2 right, 3 up). Now, I can continue moving right towards the win condition. But I still have walls at (4 right, 4 up), etc. I might need to move their ""stop"" rules as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes all walls passable. For example, ""wall IS NOT stop."" But without a ""NOT"" rule, I can't do that.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing ""wall IS stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, the rule is removed, making the wall passable. So, I can do this for each wall individually.

But that would take a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it's efficient.

Another idea: maybe the ball can be used to break through walls. If I can make the ball push walls, I could clear a path. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball into a bomb or something, but that's probably not possible with the given rules.

Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule first and see if that helps me get past the initial wall. Once I'm past that, I can assess the next steps.

So, my first action is to move the ""stop"" rule down, making the wall passable. Then, I can move right through it.

After that, I'll need to figure out how to deal with the other walls. Maybe I can move their ""stop"" rules as well or find another way to bypass them.

Alternatively, if I can reach the key, maybe it will help me change the win condition or unlock something else.

I think the key is at (1 step down), so if I can move down, I can pick it up. But the walls are in the way. So, I need to get past the walls first.

In summary, my plan is:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule at (1 right, 3 up) down to (1 right, 2 up), making the wall passable.

2. Move right through the wall.

3. Continue moving right towards the win condition, dealing with other walls as needed, possibly by moving their ""stop"" rules.

4. If possible, pick up the key to change the win condition or unlock something.

I think this is the best course of action for now. I'll start by moving the ""stop"" rule down.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The key is one step up, which might be important. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, so that's probably where I need to go.

I notice there are several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" These can be moved to change the rules. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is something.""

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use it somehow. The key is nearby, so perhaps I need to pick it up to unlock something.

I should plan my path. I'm currently at the starting position, and I need to move towards the win. There are walls blocking some paths, so I might need to break a rule to move through them. For instance, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls can't be moved, but if I change that, maybe I can pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But I might need to move through walls, so maybe I should avoid that.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I make ""baba is wall,"" then I can become a wall and maybe pass through. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Let me think about the key. It's one step up, so I can move up to get it. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or something else. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps the key is needed to change a rule.

The ball is another object. Maybe I can use it to push something or create a new rule involving the ball. If I make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

I should also consider the positions of the rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is in multiple places, which means I can create multiple new rules. For example, I can move ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is something,"" but I need to figure out what that something is.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. If I can get there, I can win. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable.

Let me try to outline my steps:

1. Move up to get the key. That's one step up.
2. With the key, perhaps I can unlock a rule or change something.
3. Then, move towards the win location, which is 9 right and 5 up.

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I need to create a new rule first. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I can use the key's properties. Or maybe ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move ""win"" to a more accessible location, that would help.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 right and 5 up. That's quite far. Maybe I can create a shortcut by changing the rules. For example, if I make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls disappear, but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is wall"" to turn into a wall and push through, but that might not be necessary.

I think the key is important. Let me try to get it first. So, I'll move up to get the key. Then, I can see if I can use it to change a rule.

After getting the key, I can look for a rule involving the key. The ""key"" rule is 9 right and 2 up. Maybe I can move it next to ""is"" to make ""key is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting to the win location. Let me try to move right and up step by step, avoiding walls.

Wait, the walls are in the way. Maybe I can change a rule to make walls passable. For example, if I make ""wall is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Alternatively, I can make ""baba is wall"" to become a wall and move through.

Alternatively, I can make ""stop is nothing"" to remove the stop property from walls, but again, I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to create a new rule. For example, ""win is key,"" which would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to get the key.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to move towards the key first. So, I'll move up to get the key. Then, I can see what to do next.

Wait, the key is one step up, so I can move up once to get it. Then, I can check if I can change a rule involving the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is 2 right and 4 up. If I can move the ball to a rule, I can create a new rule. For example, ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition.

But I'm not sure. I think the key is more important. Let me try to get the key first.

So, my plan is:

1. Move up to get the key.
2. Then, use the key to change a rule, perhaps making ""key is win"" or something else.
3. Finally, reach the win condition.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to create a new rule. For example, ""win is something,"" but I need to figure out what that something is.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is something,"" which might help me move the ball to create a path.

Wait, the ball is 2 right and 4 up. If I can move the ball to a rule, I can create a new rule. For example, ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the ball.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first.

Alright, I think I'll move up to get the key. That's one step up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a key object 1 step up. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I see walls all around, which are immovable because of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So I can't go through them. There's a ball 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""ball"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used somehow.

The ""is"" rules are scattered around. I can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition. Or perhaps I can make Baba into something else.

I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. I need to figure out how to get to the win. Let me see the layout. The walls are on the right side, so maybe I need to go around them. But since they're stop, I can't pass through. Maybe I can change a wall into something else.

Wait, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up."" If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's property. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a key to unlock a door, but I don't see a door.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, then the ball becomes the win condition. But how?

Let me think about the steps. I need to move the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""win."" So, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to both. But the ""is"" rules are in different places. Maybe I can move one of them.

Looking at the ""is"" rules: one is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, another is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and another is 2 steps down. I need to move one of these to connect ""ball"" and ""win.""

If I move the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up to be next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" then I can create a new rule like ""ball is win."" That way, when I reach the ball, it'll trigger the win condition.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Let me plan the path. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps right and 2 steps up. I need to move it to be next to the ball, which is 2 steps right and 3 steps up. So, I need to move it up one step and left one step.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule up, then left, then up again. But I have to make sure I don't get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to connect with the ball. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 4 steps up. The ball is 2 steps right and 3 steps up. That's a big distance. Maybe it's easier to move the ""is"" rule.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps right and 2 steps up. I'll move it up to 3 steps right and 3 steps up, then left to 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Now it's next to the ball. Then, I can move it right to connect with the ""win"" rule.

Wait, no, the ""win"" rule is far to the right. Maybe I should instead move the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""win."" So, I need to get the ""is"" rule between them.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a key. The key is 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""key,"" then Baba becomes a key. Then, I can pick up the key and use it to unlock something.

But I don't see a door, so maybe that's not necessary. Let me focus on the win condition. If I can make the ball the win condition, then I just need to reach the ball.

So, I'll try to move the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""win."" Let's see, the ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 2 up. I need to move it to 5 right, 3 up to be between ""ball"" and ""win."" But that's a bit far. Maybe I can move it step by step.

First, move the ""is"" rule up to 3 right, 3 up. Then right to 4 right, 3 up. Then right to 5 right, 3 up. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to ""ball"" (5 right, 3 up) and ""win"" (9 right, 4 up). Wait, no, ""win"" is at 9 right, 4 up, so that's not directly next.

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. If I move it down to 9 right, 3 up, then the ""is"" rule at 5 right, 3 up can connect to it if I move it further right.

But moving the ""win"" rule might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" in a way that forms ""ball is win.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 5 right, 3 up, which is next to the ""ball"" rule at 5 right, 2 up. Then, if I move the ""win"" rule down to 5 right, 4 up, I can have ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at 3 right, 2 up up to 3 right, 3 up.
2. Move it right to 4 right, 3 up.
3. Move it right to 5 right, 3 up. Now it's next to the ""ball"" rule at 5 right, 2 up.
4. Now, I need to connect it to ""win."" The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to 9 right, 3 up.
5. Then, move the ""is"" rule further right to 9 right, 3 up, but that's where ""win"" is. So, ""ball is win"" would be formed if ""is"" is between them.

Wait, no, because ""ball"" is at 2 right, 3 up, and ""win"" is at 9 right, 4 up. So, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to 2 right, 3 up, next to ""ball,"" and then move the ""win"" rule down to 2 right, 4 up. Then, ""ball is win"" would be the rule.

But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think about the key. The key is 1 step up. If I can make Baba into a key, then maybe I can unlock something. But I don't see a locked door.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""key,"" then the ball becomes a key. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. The key object is 1 step up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect them. So, ""key is key"" or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. Let me try that.

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""win."" The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right, 2 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 2 up. I can move the ""is"" rule right to 5 right, 2 up, which is next to ""ball."" Then, I need to move the ""win"" rule down to 5 right, 3 up. Then, the ""is"" rule can be between ""ball"" and ""win,"" forming ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule might be difficult because it's far away. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule further right. Let me try:

1. Move ""is"" at 3 right, 2 up right to 4 right, 2 up.
2. Right to 5 right, 2 up. Now it's next to ""ball"" at 5 right, 2 up.
3. Now, I need to connect it to ""win."" Maybe move the ""win"" rule down to 5 right, 3 up.
4. Then, the ""is"" rule can be at 5 right, 2 up, and ""win"" at 5 right, 3 up, forming ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""win"" rule. Let me check the objects. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 4 up. I need to move it down to 5 right, 3 up. That's a lot of steps. Maybe it's too time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule further right. Let me see:

1. Move ""is"" at 3 right, 2 up right to 4 right, 2 up.
2. Right to 5 right, 2 up.
3. Right to 6 right, 2 up.
4. Continue moving right until it's next to ""win"" at 9 right, 4 up. But that's too far, and I can't jump over walls.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me think differently. Maybe I can make Baba into a key to pick up the key object, but I don't see a door. Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into a win condition.

The key object is 1 step up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect them, then ""key is win."" So, when I pick up the key, I win.

Let me try that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at 3 right, 2 up up to 3 right, 3 up.
2. Right to 4 right, 3 up.
3. Right to 5 right, 3 up.
4. Continue moving right to 9 right, 3 up.
5. Now, move it up to 9 right, 4 up, which is next to ""win."" Wait, no, ""key"" is at 9 right, 1 up. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule down.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to 9 right, 1 up, next to ""key."" Then, move the ""win"" rule down to 9 right, 2 up. Now, ""key is win.""

But again, moving the ""win"" rule is a lot of steps. Maybe it's better to focus on the ball.

Wait, the ball is 2 right, 3 up. If I can make the ball into a win condition, then I just need to reach it. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""win.""

The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 2 up. I can move it up to 3 right, 3 up, then right to 4 right, 3 up, then right to 5 right, 3 up. Now, it's next to the ""ball"" rule at 5 right, 2 up. Wait, no, the ""ball"" rule is at 5 right, 2 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. So, I can move the ""win"" rule down to 5 right, 4 up. Then, the ""is"" rule is between ""ball"" and ""win,"" forming ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule is difficult. Maybe I can instead move the ""is"" rule to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball object. Then, move the ""win"" rule down to 2 right, 4 up. Now, ""ball is win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 2 right, 3 up, and then move the ""win"" rule to 2 right, 4 up. That way, ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""win"" rule that far. It's at 9 right, 4 up. To move it to 2 right, 4 up, I need to move it left 7 steps, which is a lot.

Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think about the key. The key is 1 step up. If I can make Baba into a key, then I can pick up the key. But I don't see a door, so maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, maybe the key is the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key will win the level. Let me try that.

The ""key"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 2 up. I can move the ""is"" rule to 9 right, 1 up, next to ""key."" Then, move the ""win"" rule down to 9 right, 2 up. Now, ""key is win.""

But again, moving the ""win"" rule is a lot. Maybe I can instead move the ""is"" rule to 9 right, 1 up, and then move the ""win"" rule down to 9 right, 2 up. Then, ""key is win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to 9 right, 1 up, next to ""key,"" and then move the ""is"" rule there. But that's also a lot of steps.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ""baba"" rule. It's at 1 left, 2 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""key,"" then Baba becomes a key. Then, I can pick up the key and maybe use it somehow.

So, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 2 up. I can move the ""is"" rule left to 2 right, 2 up, then left to 1 right, 2 up, then left to 0, 2 up, then left to 1 left, 2 up. Now, it's next to ""baba."" Then, move the ""key"" rule down to 1 left, 3 up. Now, ""baba is key.""

Wait, but the ""key"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. I can't move it to 1 left, 3 up because it's too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 1 left, 2 up, and then move the ""key"" rule down to 1 left, 3 up. But that's not possible because the ""key"" rule is too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 1 left, 2 up, and then move the ""key"" rule down to 1 left, 3 up. But I can't move the ""key"" rule that far.

Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach. Let me think again about the ball. If I can make the ball into a win condition, then I just need to reach it. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule to connect ""ball"" and ""win.""

The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 2 up. I can move it up to 3 right, 3 up, then right to 4 right, 3 up, then right to 5 right, 3 up. Now, it's next to the ""ball"" rule at 5 right, 2 up. Wait, no, the ""ball"" rule is at 5 right, 2 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule down to 5 right, 4 up. Then, the ""is"" rule is between ""ball"" and ""win,"" forming ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule is too far. Maybe I can instead move the ""is"" rule to 2 right, 3 up, next to the ball object. Then, move the ""win"" rule down to 2 right, 4 up. Now, ""ball is win.""

But again, moving the ""win"" rule is difficult. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think about the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can change that, maybe I can move through walls.

Wait, the walls are defined by ""wall is stop."" If I can change that, maybe I can make walls passable. Let me see. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""wall"" and something else, like ""move,"" then walls can be moved.

But I don't see a ""move"" rule. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. So, maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" so I can control the walls. But that might not help.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down. If I can make ""baba is wall,"" then Baba becomes a wall, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so I can pick up","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to get to the win.

First, I should note the positions of all the important objects. The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). There's a ""key"" at (9,1), which might be useful. The ""ball"" is at (2,3). There are several ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules by moving them around.

I see that there are walls blocking some paths. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,3), which probably makes walls immovable. If I can change that, maybe I can move walls. But how?

I also notice that there's a ""baba"" rule at (1,2) and a ""you"" rule at (1,2). Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around, but I can't move other objects unless they're not defined as ""stop.""

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (1,3). If I can move that, maybe I can make walls movable. But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to create a new rule that changes ""stop"" to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule onto another object. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule onto the ""key,"" I can make ""key is something,"" which might help me unlock the win.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the ""win"" rule, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move through walls or make the walls disappear.

I see that there's a ""wall"" rule at (1,3). If I can change that, perhaps I can make walls into something else, like ""win"" or ""you,"" which would allow me to pass through them.

But to change a rule, I need to move an ""is"" rule onto another object. So, I need to get an ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""is"" rules are at (8,4), (3,2), and (2,2). The ""wall"" rule is at (1,3). So, I need to move one of the ""is"" rules to (1,3).

How can I do that? I can move Baba to pick up an ""is"" rule and carry it to the ""wall"" rule. Let's see, the closest ""is"" rule is at (3,2). So, I can move right three times and up two times to get there. Then, I can carry the ""is"" rule to (1,3) to create a new rule.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule might require me to be adjacent to it. So, I need to navigate to where the ""is"" rule is. Let me plan the path.

Starting from Baba's position, which is probably at (0,0) or somewhere else. Wait, the initial position isn't clear. I need to assume where Baba is. Let's say Baba starts at (0,0). Then, to get to the ""is"" rule at (3,2), I need to move right three times and up two times.

But there might be walls in the way. Let me check the walls. There are walls at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), etc. So, moving right four steps might be blocked. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" to create a new rule. The ""ball"" is at (2,3). If I can move the ""is"" rule onto the ""ball,"" I can make ""ball is something,"" which might help me move the ball to break through walls.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would help. Maybe I can make the ball into a ""key"" or ""win."" Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become passable. But that might not be possible because ""you"" is already Baba.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so Baba is the player. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Maybe I can change ""stop"" to something else.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Identify the ""is"" rules and see how to move them to create new rules.
2. Use the ""is"" rules to change the properties of other objects, like walls or keys.
3. Create a path to the ""win"" rule by modifying the environment.

Let me try to move an ""is"" rule to the ""key"" to make ""key is win."" That way, when I pick up the key, I win. But how do I move the ""is"" rule to the key?

The key is at (9,1). The ""is"" rules are at (8,4), (3,2), and (2,2). So, I need to move one of the ""is"" rules to (9,1). That's a long way. Maybe it's easier to move the key to an ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move the key. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But I already have ""baba is you,"" so I can't change that unless I move the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule like ""key is you,"" which would allow me to move the key as if it's me. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to try to move an ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule to change the wall's properties. Let's say I move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) to (1,3), where the ""wall"" rule is. That would create a new rule ""wall is [something],"" which could change the wall's behavior.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule. How? I think I can move the ""is"" rule by moving Baba next to it and then moving in the direction of the rule. So, I need to navigate to (3,2), pick up the ""is"" rule, and move it to (1,3).

Let me plan the movements:

1. Move right three times to get to column 3.
2. Move up two times to get to row 2.
3. Now, I'm next to the ""is"" rule at (3,2). I can move up to pick it up.
4. Then, move left two times to get to column 1.
5. Move up one time to get to row 3, where the ""wall"" rule is.
6. Now, I can place the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, creating a new rule.

But wait, I need to make sure that the ""is"" rule is placed correctly. Maybe I need to move it to the same position as the ""wall"" rule.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to the same position as the ""wall"" rule, which would create a new rule like ""wall is [something].""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try a different strategy.

Another idea: the ""key"" is at (9,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""key,"" I can make ""key is win,"" which would mean that picking up the key would win the level. But how do I get the ""is"" rule to the key?

The ""is"" rule at (8,4) is closer to the key. So, maybe I can move that ""is"" rule down to (8,1) and then right to (9,1). But that's a lot of steps, and I might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a path by moving walls. But walls are ""stop,"" so they can't be moved unless I change the rule.

Wait, if I can change the ""stop"" rule, I can make walls movable. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,3). If I can move an ""is"" rule to (1,3), I can change it to something else, like ""stop is nothing,"" which would make walls passable.

So, let's try that. I'll move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) to (1,3). That would create a new rule ""stop is [something],"" which could change the stop property.

But I'm not sure what to set it to. Maybe ""stop is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, I can make ""stop is you,"" but that might not help.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" to make ""key is win."" Let's see:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (8,4).
2. Move down to (8,1).
3. Move right to (9,1) where the key is.
4. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the key, creating ""key is win.""

Then, when I pick up the key, I win. But how do I get to (8,4)? There are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) to the key. But that's also a long way.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for other rules that can help.

I see a ""ball"" rule at (5,2). If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at (2,3). If I can move the ""is"" rule to (2,3), I can make ""ball is win."" Then, when I pick up the ball, I win.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule to (2,3)? The ""is"" rule is at (3,2). So, I can move left one step and up one step to get to (2,3). Then, place the ""is"" rule there, making ""ball is win.""

That might work. Let me try that.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right three times to (3,0).
2. Move up two times to (3,2) to pick up the ""is"" rule.
3. Move left one step to (2,2).
4. Move up one step to (2,3), placing the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball.""
5. Now, the rule ""ball is win"" is active. So, when I pick up the ball, I win.

But wait, I need to make sure that the ""is"" rule is placed correctly. Maybe I need to move it to the same position as the ball.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ball to the ""is"" rule. But the ball is at (2,3), and the ""is"" rule is at (3,2). So, I can move the ball down to (2,2) and right to (3,2), but I don't know if that's possible.

I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" to make ""key is win."" That way, when I pick up the key, I win.

So, let's try that:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (8,4).
2. Move down to (8,1).
3. Move right to (9,1) where the key is.
4. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the key, creating ""key is win.""

Then, when I pick up the key, I win. But how do I get to (8,4)? There are walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) to the key. But that's a long path.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule to change the wall's properties. Let's say I make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to move through walls. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become passable because ""you"" is me. So, I can walk through walls. That could help me reach the win.

So, let's try that:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (3,2).
2. Move it to (1,3) where the ""wall"" rule is.
3. Now, the rule ""wall is you"" is active, making walls passable.

Then, I can walk through walls to reach the win.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule to (1,3)? Let's plan:

1. Start at (0,0).
2. Move right three times to (3,0).
3. Move up two times to (3,2) to pick up the ""is"" rule.
4. Move left two times to (1,2).
5. Move up one step to (1,3), placing the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

Now, the rule ""wall is you"" is active. So, walls are passable.

Then, I can move through the walls to reach the win at (9,4).

But wait, I need to make sure that the ""is"" rule is placed correctly. Maybe I need to move it to the same position as the ""wall"" rule.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""is"" rule. But I'm not sure.

I think this is the best approach. Let me try it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The key is one step to the left, which might be important. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, so that's probably where I need to go.

I notice there are several ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move some of them to create new rules or change existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I might be able to make ""key is win"" or something like that, which could change the win condition.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or break a wall. But I'm not sure how yet.

I also see a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make some walls stop moving or something. But I'm not sure.

The key is only one step to the left, so maybe I can move there quickly. If I pick up the key, perhaps it can unlock something or change the rules when combined with another rule.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might help me unlock something.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. That seems promising.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move towards the key, which is one step to the left. So I should go left.

2. Once I have the key, I can look for a way to make it the win condition. Maybe move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""

But wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can bring the ""win"" rule closer by moving it.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""key"" and ""is"" together. If I can place ""key"" next to ""is,"" then I can define a new rule like ""key is win.""

But I need to figure out how to move the rules. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up text blocks to create new rules.

So, first, I should move left to get the key. Then, I can move towards the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule to create a new rule that makes the key the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" to turn myself into the key, which might allow me to pass through locked areas or something.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me try to get the key first.

So, the immediate action should be to move left to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are marked as ""wall,"" which might have a ""stop"" property, making them immovable. The ball is at 2 steps right and 3 up. The key is 9 steps right and 1 step up. There are also several ""is"" rules, which are probably used to create new rules by moving them.

I notice that there's a ""rule `key`"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I might be able to create a new rule like ""key is something."" That could be useful for unlocking something or changing properties.

But to get there, I need to navigate through the map. The walls are in the way, so I have to find a path. Let me see the layout:

- Walls are at various positions, but there's a clear path to the right since the walls are mostly on the right side. Maybe I can move right step by step.

Wait, the key is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use a rule to change the key's properties.

Alternatively, I could try to make Baba into a key or something else. If I can create a rule like ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key or use it to unlock something.

But how do I create that rule? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. That's a distance, but maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule closer to the ""is"" rule. But I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" I need to check if the ""key"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, it's probably movable unless it's defined as ""stop.""

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. So the ""key"" rule isn't ""stop,"" so it's movable. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule.

But that would take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the ball. The ball is at 2 right and 3 up. If I can make the ball into something useful, like a tool to break walls or move rules.

Alternatively, I can try to make Baba into a different object. For example, if I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But I need to see if that's possible.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `win`"" at 9 right and 4 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create ""baba is win."" But that's a long way. Maybe I can find a closer way.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 down. If I can create a rule like ""you is win,"" then reaching ""you"" would win the game. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a key. If I can create ""ball is key,"" then I can use the ball to pick up the key. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule.

The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. So I can move the ""is"" rule two steps right to reach the ""ball"" rule. That would create ""ball is something,"" but I need to see what's next to it.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. If I move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""ball is key"" if the ""key"" rule is nearby. But the ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up, which is far.

Maybe I can create a different rule. For example, ""ball is push"" so I can push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can try to make the key into a win condition. If I can create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game. But again, moving the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule is a long process.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 4 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""baba is something."" But I'm not sure what that would help with.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. If I can move it left, I can make it closer. But I can only move it if it's not ""stop.""

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me reach the key or win. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule.

But that's 9 steps right and 1 up. I'm currently at the starting position. Maybe I can move right step by step, but that would take too long. Alternatively, I can try to create a rule that allows me to move faster or teleport.

Wait, I can try to make Baba into a key. If I can create ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. But how?

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule 6 steps right and 1 down. That's a lot, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. If I can move it left, I can bring it closer. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a tool. If I can create ""ball is push,"" I can push walls out of the way. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule.

The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. So I can move the ""is"" rule two steps right to reach the ""ball"" rule. That would create ""ball is something."" But what's next to it?

If I move the ""is"" rule to 5 right and 2 up, I can create ""ball is key"" if the ""key"" rule is nearby. But the ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up, which is far. So that might not help.

Alternatively, I can create ""ball is win."" If I can do that, then the ball becomes the win condition. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. That's too far. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. If I can create ""you is win,"" then reaching ""you"" would win the game. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to make the key into a win condition. If I can create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule.

This seems like the most straightforward approach. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position.

The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule 6 steps right and 1 down. That's a lot, but I can do it step by step.

First, I'll move right to get closer. Let's see:

1. Move right to 4 right and 2 up.
2. Move right again to 5 right and 2 up.
3. Continue moving right until I'm at 9 right and 2 up.
4. Then move down to 9 right and 1 up, where the ""key"" rule is.

Once I'm there, I can create the rule ""key is something."" But I need to see what's next to it. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game.

But wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule up to create ""key is win."" That would require moving the ""is"" rule from 9 right and 1 up to 9 right and 4 up, which is 3 steps up. That's a lot, but possible.

Alternatively, I can create ""key is you,"" making the key into myself, which might allow me to pick it up or use it in some way.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create ""key is win"" first.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position (9 right and 1 up).
2. Then move the ""is"" rule up to the ""win"" rule's position (9 right and 4 up) to create ""key is win.""

But that would take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a faster way.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a key. If I can create ""ball is key,"" then I can use the ball to pick up the key.

The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. So I can move the ""is"" rule two steps right to reach the ""ball"" rule. Then, if the ""key"" rule is nearby, I can create ""ball is key.""

But the ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up, which is far. So that might not help.

Hmm, maybe I should try to make the key into a win condition. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule.

So, I'll start by moving right step by step:

1. Move right to 4 right and 2 up.
2. Move right again to 5 right and 2 up.
3. Continue moving right until I'm at 9 right and 2 up.
4. Then move down to 9 right and 1 up, where the ""key"" rule is.

Once there, I can create ""key is something."" But I need to see what's next to it. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game.

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule up to create ""key is win.""

Alternatively, I can create ""key is you,"" making the key into myself, which might allow me to pick it up or use it in some way.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create ""key is win"" first.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position (9 right and 1 up).
2. Then move the ""is"" rule up to the ""win"" rule's position (9 right and 4 up) to create ""key is win.""

But that would take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a faster way.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a key. If I can create ""ball is key,"" then I can use the ball to pick up the key.

The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. So I can move the ""is"" rule two steps right to reach the ""ball"" rule. Then, if the ""key"" rule is nearby, I can create ""ball is key.""

But the ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up, which is far. So that might not help.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move faster. If I can make ""baba is fast,"" I can move multiple steps at once. But I don't see a ""fast"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can try to make the walls into something passable. If I can create ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for any other rules that could help.

I see a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 right and 3 up. If I can make ""stop is not,"" then walls won't stop me. But I don't see a ""not"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a tool. If I can create ""ball is push,"" I can push walls out of the way. But again, no ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. If I can create ""you is win,"" then reaching ""you"" would win the game. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to make the key into a win condition. If I can create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule.

This seems like the most straightforward approach. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position.

The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule 6 steps right and 1 down. That's a lot, but I can do it step by step.

First, I'll move right to get closer. Let's see:

1. Move right to 4 right and 2 up.
2. Move right again to 5 right and 2 up.
3. Continue moving right until I'm at 9 right and 2 up.
4. Then move down to 9 right and 1 up, where the ""key"" rule is.

Once I'm there, I can create the rule ""key is something."" But I need to see what's next to it. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game.

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule up to create ""key is win.""

Alternatively, I can create ""key is you,"" making the key into myself, which might allow me to pick it up or use it in some way.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create ""key is win"" first.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position (9 right and 1 up).
2. Then move the ""is"" rule up to the ""win"" rule's position (9 right and 4 up) to create ""key is win.""

But that would take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a faster way.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a key. If I can create ""ball is key,"" then I can use the ball to pick up the key.

The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. So I can move the ""is"" rule two steps right to reach the ""ball"" rule. Then, if the ""key"" rule is nearby, I can create ""ball is key.""

But the ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up, which is far. So that might not help.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without moving so much.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. If I can create ""you is win,"" then reaching ""you"" would win the game. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to make the key into a win condition. If I can create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule.

This seems like the most straightforward approach. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position.

The ""is"" rule is at 3 right and 2 up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule 6 steps right and 1 down. That's a lot, but I can do it step by step.

First, I'll move right to get closer. Let's see:

1. Move right to 4 right and 2 up.
2. Move right again to 5 right and 2 up.
3. Continue moving right until I'm at 9 right and 2 up.
4. Then move down to 9 right and 1 up, where the ""key"" rule is.

Once there, I can create ""key is something."" But I need to see what's next to it. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the game.

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule up to create ""key is win.""

Alternatively, I can create ""key is you,"" making the key into myself, which might allow me to pick it up or use it in some","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to get to the win.

First, I should note the positions of important objects. The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). There's a ""key"" at (9,1), which might be useful. The ""ball"" is at (2,3). There are several walls and other rules that might block my path or help me change the rules.

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move ""is"" and ""win"" next to each other, I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" which would make Baba the win condition, allowing me to win by being myself.

But to do that, I need to get close enough to the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. The ""is"" rule is at (8,4), and ""win"" is at (9,4). So they're next to each other. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

Wait, but ""baba"" is at (1,4) steps down, which is (1, -4). That's far from the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. I need to move Baba closer.

Looking at the movement options, I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I'm currently at some position, but the exact coordinates aren't given. I need to figure out how to navigate towards the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

There are walls in the way. For example, walls are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2). So moving right from my current position might be blocked by walls. Maybe I should move up first to bypass the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can create a rule like ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But if I can change that, maybe I can make walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at (1,3). If I can move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" I can create ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls block movement. But I don't want that; I want to pass through walls. So maybe I should avoid that.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule like ""wall is you,"" then walls would become me, but that might not help. Or ""wall is win,"" but that's probably not useful.

Another idea: if I can get the ""ball"" involved. The ""ball"" is at (2,3). If I can make the ball pushable or something, maybe I can use it to reach the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at (5,2). If I can create a rule like ""ball is push,"" then I can push the ball. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. If I can create ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. But the ball is at (2,3), which is closer than the ""win"" rule.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think again about the main goal: reach the ""win"" rule by making ""baba is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at (1,4) steps down, which is (1,-4). That's far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to me.

Looking at the ""is"" rules, there are several. One is at (8,4), another at (3,2), and another at (2,-2). If I can move one of these closer, I can create the needed rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at (3,2) is closer. If I can move that next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is [something]."" But I need to make it ""baba is win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). That's far to the right. Maybe I can move it left.

But how? I can only move text blocks, not walls or other objects unless they're defined as movable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (1,3). If I can make ""stop"" into something else, maybe I can move walls. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, ""wall is pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Alternatively, ""wall is not stop.""

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (1,3). If I can move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" I can create ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls block movement. But I don't want that; I want to pass through walls. So maybe I should avoid that.

Alternatively, if I can create ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule here. Maybe that's not possible.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to outline the steps I need to take:

1. Move towards the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.
2. Manipulate the rules to create ""baba is win.""
3. Reach the ""win"" condition.

But the walls are blocking my path. Maybe I can find a way around them. Let me check the map again.

The walls are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2). So moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at (0,0)) would hit a wall at (4,0). But maybe I can move up first to go around.

If I move up, I can go to (0,1), then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (4,1). Wait, no, the walls are at (4,1), so moving right beyond that is blocked. Maybe I can move up more.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left first. There's a ""wall"" rule at (-1,1). If I can move that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize the map.

- At (4,4): wall
- At (8,4): rule `is`
- At (9,4): rule `win`
- At (-1,1): rule `wall`
- At (1,3): rule `stop`
- At (2,3): ball
- At (4,3): wall
- At (3,2): rule `is`
- At (5,2): rule `ball`
- At (4,2): wall
- At (4,1): wall
- At (9,1): rule `key`
- At (4,0): wall
- At (-1,-2): rule `baba`
- At (2,-2): rule `is`
- At (1,-2): rule `you`
- At (4,-2): wall

So, I'm at some starting position, probably (0,0). The walls are along x=4 from y=-2 to y=4. So moving right beyond x=4 is blocked.

To reach the ""is"" and ""win"" rules at x=8 and x=9, I need to go around the walls. Maybe I can move up to y=5 and then right, but I don't see any walls at y=5. Let me check.

Wait, the walls are only up to y=4. So if I move up to y=5, I can move right beyond x=4. That might be a way.

So, plan:

1. Move up to y=5.
2. Move right to x=8, where the ""is"" rule is.
3. Then move right to x=9 to reach the ""win"" rule.
4. But I need to create ""baba is win,"" so I need to have the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win.""

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-2). That's far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) next to ""baba."" But that's also far.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make the ball into a win condition.

The ball is at (2,3). If I can create ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at (5,2). If I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) next to ""ball,"" I can create ""ball is [something]."" But I need to make it ""ball is win.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""is."" But the ""win"" rule is at (9,4), which is far.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule at (3,2) next to ""baba."" But ""baba"" is at (-1,-2). That's a long way.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (2,-2) next to ""baba."" That's closer. So:

1. Move down to y=-2.
2. Move left to x=-1 to reach the ""baba"" rule.
3. Then move the ""is"" rule at (2,-2) next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is [something].""

But I need to make it ""baba is win."" So I also need the ""win"" rule nearby. That's still at (9,4). This seems too far.

Maybe I should try to create a new rule that allows me to win by being Baba. So, ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to have ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" all adjacent.

But they're all over the place. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where ""baba"" is.

The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). If I can move it down to y=-2, next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule that far is a lot. I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a chain of rules. For example, make ""baba is key,"" then ""key is win."" But I don't see a ""key"" rule near ""win.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at (9,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win."" Then, if I can get the key, I can win.

But I need to reach the key first. The key is at (9,1), which is behind walls. Unless I can find a way around.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different strategy. Let me try to move towards the ""is"" rule at (3,2).

So, from my starting position (0,0):

1. Move right to x=3, but there's a wall at x=4. So I can't go beyond x=3 without moving up.

Wait, no, the walls are at x=4. So from x=3, I can move up to y=2, then right to x=8.

Wait, let me try:

1. Move right to x=3 (position (3,0)).
2. Move up to y=2 (position (3,2)), where the ""is"" rule is.
3. Now, I can move the ""is"" rule. But I need to create ""baba is win.""

But ""baba"" is at (-1,-2). So I need to move the ""is"" rule to (-1,-2) and have ""win"" nearby. That's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) next to ""baba."" But that's a long way down.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move it to (3,2), next to ""is,"" then I can create ""baba is win"" if I can get ""baba"" there.

But moving the ""win"" rule from (9,4) to (3,2) is a lot. I don't think I can do that in one move.

Wait, maybe I can break down the problem. First, move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) next to ""baba."" Then, move the ""win"" rule next to them.

But ""baba"" is at (-1,-2). So I need to move the ""is"" rule down to y=-2.

From (3,2), I can move down to y=-2, but that's 4 steps down. So:

1. Move down 4 times from (3,2) to (3,-2).
2. Then, move left to x=-1 to reach ""baba.""
3. Now, I can create ""baba is [something].""

But I need ""win"" nearby. So I also need to move the ""win"" rule to (-1,-2). That's too far.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make the ball into a win condition.

The ball is at (2,3). If I can create ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

But the ""win"" rule is at (9,4), which is far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at (5,2). So if I can move the ""is"" rule at (3,2) to (5,2), I can create ""ball is [something].""

But I need to make it ""ball is win."" So I also need the ""win"" rule at (5,2). That's not possible since ""win"" is at (9,4).

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move it to (5,2), next to ""ball"" and ""is,"" I can create ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule from (9,4) to (5,2) is a lot. I don't think I can do that in one move.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to y=2. So from (9,4), move down 2 steps to (9,2). Then, move left to (5,2). But that's still a lot.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to make the ball pushable. If I can create ""ball is push,"" then I can push the ball to reach the ""win"" rule.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key. If I can create ""ball is key,"" then I can use the ball to unlock something.

But I don't see a ""key"" rule near the ball. The ""key"" rule is at (9,1).

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at (9,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win."" Then, if I can get the key, I can win.

But the key is at (9,1), which is behind walls. Unless I can find a way around.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule at (2,-2) next to ""baba."" So:

1. Move down to y=-2.
2. Move left to x=-1 to reach ""baba.""
3. Now, I can create ""baba is [something].""

But I need ""win"" nearby. So I also need to move the ""win"" rule to (-1,-2). That's too far.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule down to y=-2. So from (9,4), move down 6 steps to (9,-2). Then, move left to (-1,-2). But that's a lot.

I don't think I can do that in one move. Maybe I need to break it down into smaller steps, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, maybe I can create a chain of rules. For example, make ""baba is key,"" then ""key is win."" But I need to have ""key"" next to ""is"" and ""win.""

The ""key"" rule is at (9,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win."" Then, if I can make ""baba is key,"" I can win by being Baba.

But I need to move the ""is"" rule at (8,4) next to ""key"" and ""win."" So:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at (8,4) down to (8,1).
2. Then, move it right to (9,1) to create ""key is win.""

But I can only move one block at a time. So first, move the ""is"" rule at (8,4) down to (8,1). Then, move it right to (9,1).

Once ""key is win"" is created, I need to make ""baba is key."" So I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key.""

But ""baba"" is at (-1,-2), and ""key"" is at (9,1). That's too far apart.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule closer to ""baba."" So:

1. Move the ""key"" rule","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to get to the win.

First, I should note the positions of important objects. The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). There's a ""key"" at (2 steps down). I remember that keys can open locks, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. There's also a ""ball"" at (2,3). Maybe I can use the ball to break something or change a rule.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I can move text blocks to change these rules. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to a wall, it might make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure.

I need to see if I can create a new rule that helps me reach the win. Maybe I can make ""baba is win"" so that when I reach the win object, I win. But how do I get there?

Looking at the walls, they're positioned in a way that might block my path. I see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can remove a wall's stopping property.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it would make that wall stop me. But I want to move through walls, so maybe I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls. How? Maybe by moving the ""stop"" rule away or changing it.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""wall is push"" so I can push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can unlock something. The key is at (2 steps down). Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to Baba to make him a key.

Wait, the key is an object, not a rule. So I need to make a rule that says ""baba is key."" To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to Baba. But where is the ""key"" rule? It's 9 steps to the right and 1 step down. That's far, but maybe I can get there.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""ball is win."" If the ball is win, then when I reach the ball, I win. The ball is at (2,3). That's closer than the win object. So maybe I can make ""ball is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use some other rules to help me move.

Wait, I can move text blocks by moving into them. So I need to get next to the ""win"" rule and move it. But that's too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to teleport or something, but I don't see a teleport rule.

Another approach: make ""you is win."" Since ""baba is you,"" that would mean Baba is win. So when I reach the win object, I win. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I need to make ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you.""

But ""you"" is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So I need to get to that position and move the ""win"" rule there. That might be possible.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""wall is nothing"" so that walls don't block me. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" and ""nothing"" together, but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I move ""stop"" next to a wall, it makes the wall stop me. But if I remove the ""stop"" rule from the wall, maybe I can pass through. How? Maybe by moving the ""stop"" rule away.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I move it somewhere else, the walls might no longer stop me. So I can move the ""stop"" rule down or left to remove it from the wall.

Let me try that. I'll move left to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Wait, I'm currently at (0,0). The ""stop"" rule is at (1,3). So I need to move right once and up three times. But that's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls along the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule by moving into it. If I can get next to it, I can push it. But I'm not sure if I can move it. Let me check the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,3). I need to get there. Let me plan the path: right, up, up, up. But are there walls blocking me? The walls are at (4,4), (4,3), etc. So maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), (4,-3), (4,-4). So they form a vertical line at x=4. I'm at x=0, so I can move right to x=1, then up to y=3.

But I need to check if there are any walls in the way. At x=1, y=3, there's the ""stop"" rule. So I can move there. Let me try moving right once, then up three times.

But wait, each move is one step. So I need to do right, up, up, up. Let me see:

1. right: x=1, y=0
2. up: x=1, y=1
3. up: x=1, y=2
4. up: x=1, y=3

Now I'm at the ""stop"" rule. I can move into it to pick it up, but I need to see if I can move it. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move into the ""stop"" rule and carry it. Then I can move it somewhere else, like down or left, to remove it from the wall.

So I'll move into the ""stop"" rule, then move down to remove it. Let's say I move down once from (1,3) to (1,2). Now the ""stop"" rule is at (1,2), and the wall at (1,3) no longer has the ""stop"" property. So I can pass through it.

Wait, but the wall is at (1,3). If I move the ""stop"" rule away, does the wall still stop me? I think so because the wall's stopping property is defined by the ""stop"" rule being next to it. So by moving the ""stop"" rule away, the wall no longer stops me.

So now I can move through the wall at (1,3). That's useful. Now I can proceed to the right.

But my goal is to reach the ""win"" rule at (9,4). That's still far. Maybe I can create a new rule that helps me move faster or change the win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But the ""win"" rule is at (9,4), which is too far. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use another rule.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at (2,3). If I can make ""ball is win,"" then when I reach the ball, I win. That's closer. So I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

But the ""win"" rule is at (9,4). How can I get it to (2,3)? That's a big move. Maybe I can find a way to teleport or use another rule to help.

Alternatively, I can make ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you."" ""You"" is at (1,2). So if I can move the ""win"" rule to (1,2), then ""you is win,"" and since ""baba is you,"" Baba becomes win. Then when I reach the win object, I win.

But moving the ""win"" rule from (9,4) to (1,2) is a long path. Maybe I can find a shortcut or use another rule to help.

Wait, there's a ""key"" at (2 steps down). Maybe I can use the key to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked. Maybe the ""win"" rule is locked, and I need the key to move it.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is you"" so that the key becomes me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another idea: make ""wall is push"" so I can push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" and ""push"" together, but I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" to break walls. If I make ""ball is bomb,"" then the ball can explode and break walls. But I don't see a ""bomb"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""ball is win"" as I thought before. Let me try that.

To make ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. The ball is at (2,3), and the ""win"" rule is at (9,4). That's a long distance. Maybe I can find a way to move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can move the ball to where the ""win"" rule is, but that's also far.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""ball"" and ""win."" If I move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, it becomes ""ball is win."" Then, when I reach the ball, I win.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's at (9,4). I need to get there. Maybe I can move right multiple times and up.

But that's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls. Let me see the path:

From (0,0), I need to go right 9 times and up 4 times. But there are walls at x=4, so I can't go beyond x=4. Wait, no, the walls are at x=4, but I can go around them if I move up or down.

Wait, the walls are at x=4, y=4; x=4, y=3; x=4, y=2; x=4, y=1; x=4, y=0; x=4, y=-1; x=4, y=-2; x=4, y=-3; x=4, y=-4. So they form a vertical line at x=4. So I can't go beyond x=4 to the right. That means I can't reach x=9. So I can't get to the ""win"" rule at (9,4). That's a problem.

So I need another approach. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to win without reaching the ""win"" object. For example, making ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But since I can't reach the ""win"" rule, I need another way.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" and ""win"" together somewhere else. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to where Baba is, then ""baba is win."" But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you."" ""You"" is at (1,2). So if I can move the ""win"" rule to (1,2), then ""you is win,"" and since ""baba is you,"" Baba becomes win. Then when I reach the win object, I win.

But again, I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls. So I need another strategy.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""key"" to unlock the ""win"" rule. The key is at (2 steps down), which is (0,-2). If I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, maybe it unlocks it. But I'm not sure how that works.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is you"" so that the key becomes me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Another idea: make ""wall is nothing"" so that walls disappear. But I don't have a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" and ""nothing"" together, but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it makes the wall stop me. But if I remove the ""stop"" rule from the wall, maybe I can pass through. I tried that earlier by moving the ""stop"" rule away, but I'm not sure if it worked.

Let me try again. I'll move left to get to the ""stop"" rule at (1,3). Then I'll move it down to (1,2). Now the wall at (1,3) no longer has the ""stop"" property, so I can pass through it.

Now I can move right to x=2, y=3, where the ball is. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then when I reach the ball, I win. So I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

But the ""win"" rule is at (9,4), which I can't reach because of the walls. So I need another way.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" and ""win"" together somewhere else. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to where the ball is, then ""ball is win."" But I can't reach the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you."" ""You"" is at (1,2). So if I can move the ""win"" rule to (1,2), then ""you is win,"" and since ""baba is you,"" Baba becomes win. Then when I reach the win object, I win.

But again, I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls. So I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" to break through walls. If I make ""ball is bomb,"" then the ball can explode and break walls. But I don't see a ""bomb"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""ball is push"" so I can push the ball through walls. But I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Another idea: make ""baba is key"" so I can unlock something. The key is at (2 steps down). If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can unlock the ""win"" rule or something else.

To make ""baba is key,"" I need to move the ""key"" rule next to Baba. The ""key"" rule is at (9,1). That's too far. So I can't do that.

Wait, maybe I can make ""key is you"" so that the key becomes me. Then I can move the key around. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is win"" so that the key becomes the win condition. Then when I reach the key, I win. The key is at (2 steps down), which is (0,-2). So if I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key wins the level.

To make ""key is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The key is at (0,-2), and the ""win"" rule is at (9,4). That's too far. So I can't do that.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the rules again.

Active rules:
- baba is you

Objects:
- wall at (4,4)
- rule `is` at (8,4)
- rule `win` at (9,4)
- rule `wall` at (1,3)
- rule `stop` at (1,3) [I moved it earlier]
- ball at (2,3)
- wall at (4,3)
- rule `is` at (3,2)
- wall at (4,2)
- rule `ball` at (5,2)
- wall at (4,1)
- rule `key` at (9,1)
- wall at (4,0)
- wall at (4,-1)
- rule `baba` at (1,2)
- rule `is` at (1,2)
- rule `you` at (1,2)
- wall at (4,-2)

Wait, I see that the ""you"" rule is at (1,2). If I can make ""you is win,"" then when I reach the win object, I win. But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls.

Alternatively, I can make ""you is key"" so that I can unlock something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is push"" so I can push objects. But I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Another idea: make ""you is jump"" so I can jump over walls. But I don't have a ""jump"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you."" ""You"" is at (1,2). So if I can move the ""win"" rule to (1,2), then ""you is win,"" and since ""baba is you,"" Baba becomes win. Then when I reach the win object, I win.

But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls. So I need another way.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" to","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, which probably makes walls immovable. The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. There are also several ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules.

I think the key here is to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or change the win condition. Maybe if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that would make walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to redefine ""win"" to be something closer.

Let me see where the ""wall"" rule is. It's 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and then place ""stop"" next to that, I can create ""wall is stop."" That would make all walls passable, which would help me move around more freely.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule like ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition. The ball is closer, so that might be a quicker path. To do that, I'd need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then place ""win"" next to that.

Another option is to make ""key is win,"" but the key is quite far to the right. Maybe it's better to focus on making the ball the win condition since it's closer.

Let me plan the steps. I need to move towards the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Then, I can move the ""ball"" rule next to it and place ""win"" next to that. But wait, the ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might take some time.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule closer to the ball. Let me see how many steps that would take. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule up one step, it would be next to the ball. Then, placing ""win"" next to that would create ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""is"" rule might require breaking another rule or using another action. I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule directly. Maybe I need to move other objects out of the way first.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to make walls movable. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another approach: since the ""win"" rule is so far, maybe I should try to redefine ""you"" to be something else. For example, ""you is key"" would make me the key, allowing me to unlock something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

I think the most straightforward path is to make the ball the win condition. Let me try that. I'll need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then place ""win"" next to that. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar.

Looking at the map, the ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule up one step, it would be next to the ball. Then, placing ""win"" next to that would create ""ball is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked by walls or other rules. Let me check the surrounding objects. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which might be in the way. I need to see if I can move around that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule closer to the ""is"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move it left by a few steps, it would be closer. But I'm not sure if that's possible without moving other rules.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make ""wall is stop"" to make walls passable. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule left by 4 steps and up by 1, it would be next to the ""wall"" rule. Then, placing ""stop"" next to that would create ""wall is stop.""

But moving the ""is"" rule that far might take too many steps. I'm not sure if that's efficient. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, the ""key"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can make ""key is win,"" then I can just go to the key. But that's even farther than the current win condition. Maybe not the best idea.

Another thought: the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might help in some way. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the win condition.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""win"" rule directly, even though it's far. Let me see how many steps that would take. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a lot, but maybe I can find a path through the walls if I can make them passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to teleport or move faster. For example, ""baba is fast"" or something like that. But I don't see a ""fast"" rule on the map, so that might not be possible.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" rule. Maybe if I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and use it to reach the win condition. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can move as the ball, which might have different properties.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and then place ""you"" next to that. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. That's quite far from the ball. Maybe it's not feasible.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move it left by a few steps, it would be easier to reach. But I don't know how to move rules directly.

Another idea: since the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, maybe I can move it to make walls movable. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become passable. Let me try that.

To create ""wall is stop,"" I need to have the ""wall"" rule, ""is"" rule, and ""stop"" rule in a line. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up.

If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to the ""wall"" rule, then place ""stop"" next to that, I can create ""wall is stop."" But moving the ""is"" rule from 3 right, 2 up to 1 left, 3 up would require moving it left by 4 steps and up by 1. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then place ""is"" in between. The ""stop"" rule is 1 right, 3 up. The ""wall"" rule is 1 left, 3 up. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule left by 2 steps, it would be next to the ""wall"" rule. Then, placing ""is"" between them would create ""wall is stop.""

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked. Let me check the surrounding objects. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which might block the way. I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make ""you is win"" directly. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and then place ""win"" next to that, I can create ""you is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But that would require moving the ""is"" rule from 3 right, 2 up to 1 right, 2 down, which is a big move.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win."" The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then place ""win"" next to that, I can create ""baba is win."" But again, moving the ""is"" rule that far seems difficult.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""win"" rule step by step, even if it takes a long time. Let me see the path. The ""win"" rule is 9 right, 4 up. I need to move right 9 times and up 4 times, but there are walls in the way. If I can make walls passable, it would be easier.

Wait, there's a ""key"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe if I can get the key, I can unlock something. But I don't see a lock on the map, so maybe that's not useful.

Another thought: the ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make ""ball is push,"" I can push it to break through walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule on the map.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""ball"" rule to create ""ball is win."" Let me try that.

The ""is"" rule is 3 right, 2 up. The ""ball"" rule is 5 right, 2 up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule right by 2 steps, it would be next to the ""ball"" rule. Then, placing ""win"" next to that would create ""ball is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked. Let me check the surrounding objects. There's a wall 4 right, 3 up, which might block the way. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can move the ""ball"" rule left by 2 steps to be next to the ""is"" rule. But I don't know how to move the ""ball"" rule directly.

This is frustrating. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""win"" rule and see if I can find a way through. Let me start moving right and up step by step, and see if I can find a path.

First, I'll move right to get closer to the ""win"" rule. Let's see, moving right from my current position. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 left, 3 up. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" I can pass through walls. Let me try that again.

To create ""wall is stop,"" I need the ""wall"" rule, ""is"" rule, and ""stop"" rule in a line. The ""wall"" rule is 1 left, 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is 1 right, 3 up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule to be between them, I can create ""wall is stop.""

The ""is"" rule is currently 3 right, 2 up. To move it to 0 right, 3 up (between ""wall"" and ""stop""), I need to move it left by 3 steps and up by 1 step. That's possible if there's a path.

Let me plan the moves:

1. Move left 3 times to get to the same column as the ""wall"" rule.
2. Move up once to reach the ""wall"" rule's row.
3. Then, place the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.
4. Finally, place the ""stop"" rule next to the ""is"" rule to complete ""wall is stop.""

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Let me check the objects in between. There's a wall 4 right, 3 up, which is in the way. I can't move through walls unless I make them passable, which is what I'm trying to do.

This is a catch-22. I can't move the ""is"" rule to create ""wall is stop"" because the wall is blocking the way. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule instead. The ""stop"" rule is 1 right, 3 up. If I can move it left by 2 steps to be next to the ""wall"" rule, then I can place the ""is"" rule in between.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked. Let me see if there's a path. The ""stop"" rule is 1 right, 3 up. To move it left, I need to move it through any walls. But walls are currently stop, so I can't move through them.

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try to make ""you is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and placing ""win"" next to that. The ""you"" rule is 1 right, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is 3 right, 2 up. To move the ""is"" rule down by 4 steps and left by 2 steps would be a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is 9 right, 4 up. If I can move it left by a few steps, it would be easier to reach. But I don't know how to move rules directly.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""ball"" rule and see if I can use it somehow. The ""ball"" is 2 right, 3 up. If I can reach it, maybe I can push it or use it to break through walls.

Let me try moving right 2 steps and up 3 steps to reach the ball. But I need to check if there are walls in the way. There's a wall 4 right, 3 up, which is beyond the ball's position. So, maybe I can reach the ball without issues.

Once I'm at the ball, what can I do? If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then place ""win"" next to that.

The ""is"" rule is 3 right, 2 up. The ball is 2 right, 3 up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule up by 1 step, it would be next to the ball. Then, placing ""win"" next to that would create ""ball is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not blocked. Let me see if there's a path. The ""is"" rule is 3 right, 2 up. To move it up, I need to check if there's a wall or other rule blocking the way. There's a wall 4 right, 3 up, which is to the right of the ""is"" rule. So, moving up from 3 right, 2 up to 3 right, 3 up should be possible, as there's no wall directly above.

Once the ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 3 up, I can move it left by 1 step to be next to the ball at 2 right, 3 up. Then, placing ""win"" next to that would create ""ball is win.""

After that, I just need to reach the ball, which is now the win condition. Since I'm already at the ball, I can just stay there, and it would be the win.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and the ball is an object. So, if I make ""ball is win,"" I need to be on the ball to win. But I'm not sure if that's how it works. Maybe I need to make ""baba is ball"" to become the ball.

Alternatively, making ""ball is you"" would let me control the ball. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the key is to create ""ball is win"" so that stepping on the ball triggers the win condition. So, after creating that rule, I just need to be on the ball.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I need to make ""you is ball"" to become the ball. Let me think.

If I make ""you is ball,"" then I would be the ball, and I could move as the ball. But I'm not sure if that helps me reach the win condition.

Alternatively, making ""ball is win"" would mean that the ball is the win condition, so I just need to be on the ball to win.

I think the latter makes more sense. So, I'll proceed with creating ""ball is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then place ""win"" next to that. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 3 right, 2 up to 2 right, 3 up (next to","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are probably ""STOP"" by default, so I can't move through them. The ball and key might be movable if their rules aren't set to stop. The rules themselves can be moved to create new rules or break existing ones.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step down. Maybe I can use that somehow. If I can get the key to the ""WIN"" rule, perhaps I can change the win condition. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule could allow me to redefine what Baba is, which might help in moving through walls or other obstacles.

Wait, there's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up."" That's near the ""win"" rule. If I can move the key next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to pick up the key.

But how do I move the key? I need to get Baba next to the key. The key is 1 step down, so I should move down. But I have to make sure there's a path. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. That might block my path. Maybe I can move a rule to change the wall's property.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to redefine Baba. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key."" The ""is"" rule is 2 steps down, so I can move it up.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 2 steps down, and the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can create ""baba is key."" That would make me the key, allowing me to pick it up.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" rule to the left, next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" creating ""baba is key."" Then, I can move to the key, pick it up, and then move towards the ""win"" rule.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from its current position. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps down. I can move up to get closer. Let me try moving up first to get near the ""is"" rule.

Wait, I'm currently at the starting position. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps down, so I need to move down twice to reach it. But there might be walls blocking me. Let me check the walls around me. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is far. Closer walls are at 4 steps right and 3 up, etc. Maybe the path is clear.

So, I'll move down twice to get to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it left to create ""baba is key."" Once that's done, I can move to the key and then proceed to the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, if moving the ""is"" rule isn't possible, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win"" to change the win condition to the key. That might be easier.

But I think the first approach is better. Let me try moving down to get to the ""is"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That seems pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step up. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. I wonder if the ball is important.

I see several walls and rules scattered around. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, which might block movement. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, so walls are defined as stoppers.

I need to figure out how to move Baba to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I have to avoid walls unless I can change the rules.

Wait, there's a ""key"" 1 step up. Maybe I can pick up the key to unlock a path. But how? I don't see a lock, so maybe the key is part of a rule I can create.

I also notice there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I could make ""key is win"" or something like that, which might change the win condition.

But first, I need to get closer to the key. Let me see where I am. The initial position is where Baba is, which is probably the starting point. The key is 1 step up, so maybe I can move up to get it.

Wait, but if I move up, is there a wall blocking me? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is above me. But I'm trying to move up 1 step, so maybe that's clear.

So, my first move should be to move up to get the key. That might help me unlock something or change the rules to make winning easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get closer to the win rule. But the win rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is quite a distance. There might be walls in the way.

I think the key is more accessible, so I'll try to move up to get it. Once I have the key, I can see if I can create a new rule that makes winning easier, like ""key is win"" so that picking up the key completes the level.

So, the action I should take is to move up to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball is important.

I see several walls and rules. The walls are placed in various positions, some with steps up and down. The rules include ""wall is stop,"" which means walls can't be moved. There's also a ""ball is ball"" rule, which probably means the ball behaves normally unless changed.

I need to figure out how to move Baba to reach the win condition. Since the win is so far to the right, maybe I need to create a path or change some rules to make movement easier. Let me see if I can move any rules to alter the game mechanics.

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 4 up, and another at 3 steps right and 2 up. Maybe I can move these to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would become the win condition, but that might not help. Alternatively, making ""ball is you"" could let me control the ball, which might help in moving through the level.

Wait, the key is 9 steps right and 1 up. If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks a door or changes a rule. But how do I get to the key? There are walls in the way. Maybe I can break a rule to make the walls passable.

Looking at the rules, ""wall is stop"" makes walls immovable. If I can change that, maybe I can move through walls. How? If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then walls won't stop me. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""is"" and ""stop"" rules. But I'm not sure how to do that exactly.

Another idea: the ""ball"" is 2 steps right and 3 up. If I can make the ball pushable, maybe I can use it to break through walls or reach higher places. But I'm not sure how to make the ball pushable unless I change its rule.

Wait, the ""ball is ball"" rule is at 5 steps right and 2 up. If I can change that to ""ball is push,"" then I could push the ball to clear a path. But I don't see a ""push"" rule mentioned, so maybe that's not possible.

Let me think about the key again. If I can get the key, maybe it changes the win condition or unlocks a path. But to get the key, I need to move right 9 steps and up 1. That's a long way, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to teleport or move faster.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 right and 4 up. If I can move that to create a new rule like ""baba is fast,"" but I don't see a ""fast"" property. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""you."" But ""you"" is at 1 right and 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. That's too far apart.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down. If I can move that to make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would be the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Another approach: maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. It's at 9 right and 4 up. If I can bring it down, then I can reach it without going all the way right. But how?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving some rules to see if I can create a new rule that helps. For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is you,"" so I can control the key and bring it to me. But I don't know if that's possible.

Wait, the ""key"" is 9 right and 1 up. If I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level. But I'm not sure how to do that.

I think I need to focus on moving the ""stop"" rule away from the walls to make them passable. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's 1 right and 3 up. If I can move that to a different location, then walls won't stop me anymore.

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls. To do that, I need to move it somewhere else, maybe down or left. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, walls become passable, and I can move through them to reach the key and the win condition.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it by controlling Baba. Since Baba is me, I can move around and pick up the ""stop"" rule if it's movable. Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, so maybe it's attached to the wall. I might need to break that rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the ""stop"" rule. For example, if I can make ""stop is not,"" then walls wouldn't stop me. But I'm not sure how to do that.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving Baba to the right to see if I can reach the key or the win condition without changing any rules. But there are walls blocking the way.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 2 right and 3 up. If I can move the ball to break through walls, maybe that would help. But I don't know how to make the ball moveable or pushable.

Another idea: the ""rule `is`"" at 3 right and 2 up. If I can move that to create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" then Baba would become the key, and I could unlock something. But I'm not sure.

I think I need to try moving the ""stop"" rule. Let me see how. If I can move the ""stop"" rule down, then the walls won't have the ""stop"" property anymore. So, I'll try moving the ""stop"" rule down.

To do that, I need to move Baba to where the ""stop"" rule is. The ""stop"" rule is 1 right and 3 up. So, I'll move right once and up three times to reach it. Then, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, like down.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them. Then, I can go right to reach the key and the win condition.

So, my first action should be to move right to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Let me try that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Hmm, maybe I need the key for something. There are several walls and other rules scattered around.

I notice there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can rearrange them to change the game's rules. For example, if I can move a ""stop"" rule onto a wall, it might make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the key is only 1 step to the left. Maybe I should move towards it. But first, I need to see if I can get to it without hitting any walls. Let me check the walls' positions. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is above me. Another wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so it's in the way if I go right. But the key is to the left, so maybe I can go left.

But I'm currently at the starting position. If I move left, I might hit a wall. Let me see: the wall is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So if I move left, I might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

I think the best first move is to move left towards the key. Let me try that. So I'll choose the ""left"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" object 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I see walls all around, which are immovable because of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So I can't go through them. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used somehow, but I'm not sure yet.

The rules are laid out with ""is"" commands. For example, ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 4 step up"" probably means that the ""is"" rule is placed there. Similarly, ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up"" is where the win condition is.

I need to figure out how to move Baba to reach the win. Since the walls are blocking me, maybe I can change a rule to make them passable. If I can move a ""stop"" rule away from the walls, they might become passable.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe the walls will no longer stop me. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If I move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, the walls might lose their stopping property. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. But how? I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""stop."" So I need to find a way to move the ""stop"" rule without it being immovable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that overrides the ""stop"" property. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me. But I don't see a ""not"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule onto another object, like the ball, then the ball would become stop, and the walls would no longer be stop. That could work.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule from its current position to the ball's position. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right to align it with the ball.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. But since it's currently ""stop,"" I can't move it directly. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I can change the rule temporarily.

Wait, if I can move another rule onto the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to change its properties. For example, if I can make ""stop is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule to make Baba able to move it. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move Baba there, maybe I can interact with the ""stop"" rule.

But moving Baba that far might be tricky because of the walls. Let me see the layout again. The walls are 4 steps to the right and various steps up and down. So, the main area is blocked by walls on the right, but maybe there's a path around.

Wait, the ""key"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to get the key first. But to get the key, I need to move right, which is blocked by walls. So, I'm stuck unless I can move the walls or make them passable.

Another approach: maybe I can create a new rule by moving text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition something else. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""win,"" making ""baba is win,"" which would mean Baba is the win condition, so I just need to be myself. But that might not help because I still need to reach the win object.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location, that would help. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to it, which might be complicated.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first. Since it's 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, and the ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, if I can move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right, it would be on the ball, making the ball stop instead of the walls. Then, the walls would no longer be stop, and I could move through them.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's currently ""stop,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change the rule temporarily by moving another rule onto it. For example, if I can make ""stop is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""baba is stop."" Then, Baba would become stop, but that would make me immovable, which isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""you"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to the ""stop"" rule's position, making ""you is stop,"" then I would become stop, which isn't good.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to approach it differently. Let me look for other rules that can be moved. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable.

For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" making ""wall is push,"" which would allow me to push walls. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make the ball push walls, I could use it to clear a path. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball into a win condition, then maybe I can win by reaching the ball. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is far to the right, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to it, which might require moving through walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first, even if it's tricky. Let me see: the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move it one step to the right, it would be on the ball, making the ball stop. Then, the walls would no longer be stop, and I could move through them.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's currently ""stop,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change the rule temporarily by moving another rule onto it. For example, if I can make ""stop is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to approach it differently. Let me look for other rules that can be moved. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

I'm still stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move any other rules to create a new rule that helps me.

Looking at the ""ball"" rule, it's 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create a new rule like ""ball is something."" Maybe ""ball is win,"" so reaching the ball would win the level.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up next to the ""ball"" rule at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That would require moving the ""is"" rule two steps to the right.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's currently ""is,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change its rule by moving another rule onto it.

Wait, if I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""is"" rule, making ""baba is is,"" which might not make sense. Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule onto the ""is"" rule, making ""you is is,"" which also doesn't seem helpful.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule first, even if it's difficult. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move Baba to the position of the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up.
2. Once there, move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right, onto the ball.
3. Now, the ball becomes ""stop,"" and the walls are no longer ""stop,"" so they become passable.
4. Then, I can move through the walls to reach the win condition.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's currently ""stop,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change the rule temporarily by moving another rule onto it.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""is is stop,"" which might not help. Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""you is stop,"" which would make me immovable.

Hmm, that's not good. Maybe I need to find another way.

Another idea: if I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""baba is stop,"" then Baba would become stop, but that would make me immovable, which isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""wall is stop."" But that's already the case, so it wouldn't change anything.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move it closer, I can reach it without going through walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is something.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's currently ""is,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change its rule by moving another rule onto it.

Wait, if I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""is"" rule, making ""baba is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule onto the ""is"" rule, making ""you is is,"" which also doesn't help.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think outside the box. What if I create a new rule that makes the win condition something else, like the ball? Then I can win by reaching the ball instead of going all the way to the right.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and the ""win"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a long distance, and I can't move through walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to the ball's level. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move it down two steps, it would be at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is near the ball.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's currently ""win,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change its rule by moving another rule onto it.

If I can move the ""is"" rule onto the ""win"" rule, making ""win is something,"" but I don't know what that would do. Maybe it would change the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""win"" rule, making ""baba is win,"" which would mean Baba is the win condition. Then, I just need to be myself, but that doesn't help because I still need to reach the win object.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule again. Let me try to plan it step by step:

1. Move Baba to the position of the ""stop"" rule: 1 step right, 3 steps up.
2. Once there, move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right, onto the ball.
3. Now, the ball becomes ""stop,"" and the walls are no longer ""stop,"" so they become passable.
4. Then, I can move through the walls to reach the win condition.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's currently ""stop,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change its rule by moving another rule onto it.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""is is stop,"" which might not help. Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""you is stop,"" which would make me immovable.

Hmm, that's not good. Maybe I need to find another way.

Another idea: if I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""baba is stop,"" then Baba would become stop, but that would make me immovable, which isn't helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule onto the ""stop"" rule, making ""wall is stop."" But that's already the case, so it wouldn't change anything.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move it closer, I can reach it without going through walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is something.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's currently ""is,"" so I can't move it directly. Maybe I can change its rule by moving another rule onto it.

Wait, if I can move the ""baba"" rule onto the ""is"" rule, making ""baba is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule onto the ""is"" rule, making ""you is is,"" which also doesn't help.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think differently. What if I create a new rule that makes the win condition something else, like the ball? Then I can win by reaching the ball instead of going all the way to the right.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and the ""win"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a long distance, and I can't move through","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" object 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another key 1 step down. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something.

There are several walls around, which are probably blocking my path. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, so that might be an immovable wall. The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and there's a ""ball"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to break something or change a rule.

I notice there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""baba"" and ""you"" closer, I might change the active rule. But right now, ""baba is you"" is the only active rule, so I control Baba.

I need to figure out how to get to the ""win"" object. The walls are in the way, so maybe I can break them by changing the rules. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become immovable, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" walls disappear.

Wait, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that closer to a wall, maybe I can change the wall's properties. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me think about the key. If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks a door or changes something else. The key is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is far. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is you"" to make the key controllable, but I'm not sure if that's allowed.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. Let me see how many steps I need to take. The key is 9 steps right and 1 up. That's a long way. Are there any obstacles in the way? There are walls at 4 steps right and various up positions, so I might need to go around.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the ball push something, like a wall, to clear the path. But I need to figure out how to make the ball moveable.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule so that ""ball is you,"" making the ball controllable. Then I can use it to reach the key or win.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules around. I need to get closer to the ""is"" rules to combine them with other objects.

Let me try moving right a few steps to get closer to the ""is"" rules. If I move right, I can maybe reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 up. Then I can combine it with another object to create a new rule.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. If I move right, I can get closer to the ""is"" rules. Let me try moving right once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The key is one step to the left, which might be important. The rules are spread out, and some of them are ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change how objects behave. Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can create a new rule that helps me reach the win. The key is close, so maybe I can move it or use it somehow.

Wait, the key is one step to the left. If I can move the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked. There's a ""stop"" rule nearby, which might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. If I can change that rule, maybe I can move freely.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into something else. If I can create a rule like ""baba is key,"" then I could potentially pick up the key or use it to unlock a path. Let me see where the key is and how I can get to it.

I'm currently at the starting position. The key is one step to the left, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the wall or change its properties. If I can make the wall into a different object, like a ""stop"" or ""you,"" that might help me pass through.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key, I can create a new rule like ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. Then I could move it to the win condition. But I need to make sure I can reach the ""is"" rule first.

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move there, I can combine it with the key. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can break through by changing the wall's properties.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the right and three steps up. If I can change that to something else, like ""stop is nothing,"" then the walls might become passable. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule. The ball is two steps to the right and three steps up. If I can make the ball into something else, like a ""you,"" I could use it to bounce or move in a different way.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I need to get to the key. To do that, I might need to remove or change the walls blocking my path. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can make those walls into something else, like ""stop"" or ""you.""

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and three steps up. If I can move that rule next to a wall, I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls might become immovable, but that doesn't help me. Maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would let me pass through them.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" the walls would disappear, clearing my path to the key. That sounds promising. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then place ""nothing"" next to it. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule on the map. Hmm.

Maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing elements. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then move another rule, like ""stop,"" next to it, I can create ""wall is stop."" But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and use it to unlock the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""key."" But I'm not sure how to get the key into position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then next to ""you,"" making ""key is you."" That way, the key becomes controllable, and I can move it to the win.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to visualize the map. The key is one step to the left, but there's a wall in the way. The ""is"" rule is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the key is, I can create a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule down two steps, it would be next to the key. Then, if I can move the ""you"" rule next to it, I can make ""key is you."" That would let me control the key. But how do I move the ""you"" rule?

The ""you"" rule is two steps down. If I can move it up, I can place it next to the ""is"" rule and the key. But moving rules requires moving them step by step, which might take several actions.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move it next to the ""is"" rule, I can make ""baba is key,"" which would let me become the key.

This seems possible. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule down two steps to be next to the key.
2. Move the ""baba"" rule to the right and up to combine with ""is"" and ""key.""
3. Create the rule ""baba is key,"" which would let me control the key.
4. Use the key to reach the win condition.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""baba"" rule that way. It might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then next to ""you.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. That's far away. Maybe it's better to focus on the key object, which is one step to the left.

If I can make the wall into ""stop,"" then I can't move through it, but if I make it into ""you,"" I can pass through. So, moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then placing ""you"" next to it would make ""wall is you,"" allowing me to walk through walls.

That could be a good strategy. Let me try that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to a wall.
2. Move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and the wall, creating ""wall is you.""
3. Now, walls become passable, and I can move through them to reach the key.

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? It's two steps down. I need to move it up to where the ""is"" rule is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule first, then move a wall next to it to create ""you is wall,"" which would make me a wall. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, if I make ""you is wall,"" then I become a wall, which might prevent me from moving. That's not good.

Maybe a better approach is to make ""stop is nothing,"" so the stop rule is removed, allowing me to move through walls. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""stop is you,"" which would let me move through stop rules as if they were passable. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for the win condition. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and four steps up. That's far away, but maybe I can change the win condition to something closer.

If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and then next to ""win.""

But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe it's better to focus on reaching the key first.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, but there's a wall blocking me. If I can move the wall, I can reach the key. How can I move the wall? I can't move walls directly unless I change their properties.

So, I need to change the wall into something movable. If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can move the wall. Let me try that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to a wall.
2. Move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and the wall, creating ""wall is you.""
3. Now, the wall becomes movable, and I can move it out of the way.

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? It's two steps down. I need to move it up to where the ""is"" rule is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is, then move a wall next to it.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule down two steps, it would be next to the ""you"" rule. Then, if I move a wall next to it, I can create ""you is wall,"" which would make me a wall. That's not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps down. If I can move it next to the ""is"" rule, I can create a new rule.

For example, moving the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then next to ""key"" would make ""baba is key,"" which would let me become the key. Then I could move the key to the win.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""baba"" rule. It's blocked by walls. Maybe I can change the walls first.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls become immovable, but that doesn't help me. Alternatively, making ""wall is nothing"" would remove the walls, but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. If I can move it left, it would be closer to me.

But moving rules requires moving them step by step, which might take too long. Maybe I can focus on the key object instead.

The key is one step to the left. If I can move the wall blocking me, I can reach it. So, back to the idea of making ""wall is you"" to move the wall.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule down two steps to be next to the key.
2. Move the ""you"" rule up two steps to be next to the ""is"" rule and the key.
3. Create the rule ""key is you,"" making the key controllable.
4. Move the key to the win condition.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""you"" rule that way. It might be blocked by other objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then next to the key, creating ""baba is key."" Then, I would become the key and could move it.

But again, moving the ""baba"" rule might be difficult due to walls.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. The ball is one step to the right and three steps up. If I can move it next to the ""is"" rule and then next to ""win,"" I can create ""ball is win.""

But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe it's better to focus on the key.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for any movable rules or objects that can help me change the game mechanics.

I see the ""stop"" rule is three steps up. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then stop rules are removed, allowing me to move through walls. But I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, making ""stop is you"" would let me move through stop rules as if they were passable. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can make ""stop is win,"" then stepping on a stop rule would win the game. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I win the game immediately. But I need to create that rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win."" But the ""win"" rule is far away.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is key,"" then move the key to the win.

This seems possible. Let me try:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba.""
2. Move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and ""baba,"" creating ""baba is key.""
3. Now, I can control the key.
4. Move the key to the win condition.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? It's eight steps to the right and one step up. That's too far.

Wait, the key object is one step to the left. Maybe I can reach it without moving the ""key"" rule.

If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. But I need to create that rule.

So, steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba.""
2. Move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and ""baba,"" creating ""baba is key.""
3. Now, I can move as the key.
4. Move to the key object and win.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""key"" rule. It's too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to where the key is.

Wait, the key is one step to the left. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and the key, making ""key is you.""

But I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then next to ""you,"" making ""wall is you,"" which would let me pass through walls.

Let me try that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to a wall.
2. Move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and the wall, creating ""wall is you.""
3. Now, walls are passable, and I can move through them.
4. Move left to reach the key.
5. Once I have the key, move it to the win condition.

This seems feasible. Let me outline the steps:

- Move the ""is"" rule down two steps to be next to a wall.
- Move the ""you"" rule up two steps to be next to the ""is"" rule and the wall.
- Create ""wall is you,"" making walls passable.
- Move left through the wall to reach the key.
- Pick up the key and move it to the win.

I think this is the best approach. So, the first step is to move the ""is"" rule down two steps.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" object 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and another key 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something.

There are several walls and ""stop"" rules, which probably make objects immovable. The ""ball"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, and there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to change rules.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and another property, I can change what Baba is.

I'm at the starting position, and I need to figure out how to move towards the win. The walls are in the way, but maybe I can break through them by changing the rules. If I can make Baba not stop at walls, I can move through them.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 4 steps up. If I can move that away or change it, maybe I can make walls passable. Alternatively, I could make Baba into a different object that can pass through walls.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the ""is"" rules to create new combinations. Maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule next to a different property. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then Baba becomes the win condition, and I can step on myself to win.

Alternatively, I could make ""baba is key"" to pick up the key and unlock something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is near the ""win"" rule. Maybe I can move Baba towards that area to create a new rule.

I should also consider the key's position. If I can get the key, maybe it can help me unlock a path to the win. But I'm not sure how yet.

Let me plan my moves. I need to move right to get closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. From my current position, moving right will take me towards the wall, but if I can change the rules before hitting the wall, I can proceed.

Wait, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the wall passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through it.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule and the ""stop"" rule next to an ""is"" rule. For example, if I can place ""wall is not stop,"" that would change the wall's properties.

Alternatively, I could make ""baba is not stop,"" allowing me to pass through walls. That might be easier.

Let me try to move towards the ""is"" rule. I'm currently at the starting point, so moving right a few times might get me closer. But I have to be careful not to hit a wall without changing the rules first.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I can make the ball move, it might help me rearrange the rules.

But I'm not sure how to control the ball. Maybe if I make ""ball is you,"" I can control it, but that would mean I'm no longer Baba. That might complicate things.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" to create a new rule. For example, ""ball is win"" could make the ball the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

I think the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or change my properties. Let me try moving right a few times to get closer.

After moving right, I can then move up to reach the ""is"" rule. Once there, I can combine it with another rule to change my properties.

Wait, there's a ""baba"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that next to an ""is"" rule, I can redefine Baba's properties.

For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on myself would win the level. That could be a quick solution.

Alternatively, making ""baba is key"" would allow me to pick up the key and possibly unlock something.

I think the key is to create a new rule that either changes my properties or redefines the win condition. Let me try to move towards the ""is"" rule to do that.

So, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Once I'm in position, I'll move up to combine the rules.

After creating the new rule, I can then move towards the win condition or use the key if needed.

I need to be careful not to get stuck by walls without changing the rules first. So, planning the path to the ""is"" rule is crucial.

Alright, let's try moving right to start.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" object 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I see a ""ball"" 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to move other objects or break walls. There are several walls around, so I might need to move the ball to break through them.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the properties of objects. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to make walls passable.

I also notice a ""baba"" rule 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. Maybe I can change what Baba is by moving this rule. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can manipulate these, I might gain new abilities.

I think the key is to get the key first. It's 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. I can move left twice and up once to reach it. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a path to the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try moving the ball to break walls. The ball is 4 steps up, so moving up four times might get it to a position where it can break a wall. But I need to make sure the ball can move through the map.

Another idea is to change the rules. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might make walls stop being solid. Or moving the ""wall"" rule could make walls into something else, like passable objects.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first since it's closer. Let me plan my steps: move left twice and up once to get the key. Then, see if I can use it to unlock something near the win condition.

Wait, but the key is 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. From my current position, moving left twice and up once should get me there. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I should note the positions of the important objects. The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. The key is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. There are also several rule blocks like ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" and ""key."" These can be moved to create or change rules.

I notice that there's a ""stop"" rule at 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or prevent certain actions. But I'm not sure yet.

The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I need to see if there's a way to make the ball move towards the win.

The key is at 1 left, 1 up. Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, but I don't see a lock mentioned. Maybe it's part of a rule I can create.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. These can be used to create new rules by moving them next to other objects or words.

My initial thought is to move towards the win. But the path is blocked by walls. I need to find a way to remove or bypass the walls. Maybe I can create a rule that makes walls passable or turn them into something else.

Looking at the rules, I can try to create a new rule by moving a subject next to a property. For example, if I can move ""baba"" next to ""win,"" that might make Baba the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball or key into something useful. If I can make the ball ""win,"" then maybe I can throw it to the win position. But I need to see if that's possible.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win,"" that would make the ball the win condition. Then, I just need to get the ball to the win position. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into a tool that can break walls. If I can make ""key is tool,"" then I can use it to destroy walls. But I don't see a ""tool"" rule, so that might not work.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but I already have a ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can rearrange that.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps up. If I move it next to a wall, maybe I can make walls stop me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is push,"" then I can push objects. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Hmm.

Let me think about the positions again. The win is at 8 right, 5 up. That's far. I need to find a way to get there without being blocked by walls.

Maybe I can create a rule that makes Baba able to jump or fly. If I can make ""baba is jump,"" then I can jump over walls. But I don't see a ""jump"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the ball ""jump,"" then maybe I can ride it or use it to get over walls. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""win,"" so when I reach the ball, it counts as winning. But the ball is closer, so that might not help.

Wait, the key is at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to pick up the key. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" so the key becomes me, but that might not help.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving some rules to see what happens. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""something is win."" Maybe that can help.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""win,"" making Baba the win condition. Then, when I reach the win position, I win. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm already controlling Baba. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" so walls disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I need to break down an existing rule. For example, if I can separate ""baba is you,"" then I can change what Baba is. But I don't know how to do that yet.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule away from ""baba,"" but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""baba"" next to another property. For example, ""baba is win,"" which would make Baba the win condition. Then, when I reach the win position, I win. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, the win is at 8 right, 5 up. I need to get there. Maybe I can create a rule that makes the ball move towards the win. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then maybe I can push it towards the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so when I reach the ball, it counts as winning. But the ball is closer, so that might not help.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try moving towards the win and see if I can find a path. Let me see the walls. There are walls at 3 right, 5 up; 3 right, 4 up; 3 right, 3 up; 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; and 3 right, 1 down. So, the path to the win is blocked by walls on the right side.

Maybe I can go up first and then right. Let me see. If I move up, I can go to 5 up, but there's a wall at 3 right, 5 up. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can go left first. There's a wall at 2 left, 4 up, but I don't see a clear path.

Wait, the key is at 1 left, 1 up. Maybe I can pick up the key and use it somehow. But I don't see a lock, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key next to a rule to create a new rule. For example, ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key.

But the key is at 1 left, 1 up, which is closer. So, if I can make ""key is win,"" then I can win by reaching the key. That might be a way.

So, how can I create ""key is win""? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. That's far. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule towards the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. But that's also a long distance.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win."" But I need to position them correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win"" by moving the ""key"" rule towards it. Let me see the positions.

The ""key"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule up, it can be next to ""win."" Then, I can create ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Let me plan the steps.

First, I need to move towards the ""key"" rule. It's at 8 right, 2 up. I'm currently at some position, but I need to see where I am. Wait, the initial position isn't given, but I can assume I'm near the starting point.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is. But that's also a lot of steps.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" so walls disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""key"" rule and see if I can create a new rule there.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can make the ball ""win,"" then I can reach it and win. But I need to create ""ball is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" The ""ball"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. That's a long distance, but maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule towards ""win.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule towards the ""ball"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to both ""ball"" and ""win"" to create ""ball is win."" But I need to position them correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball move towards the win by creating a rule that makes it pushable or something.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""key"" rule and see if I can create a new rule there.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so I can pick up the key and use it somehow. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move there, maybe I can pick it up and use it to unlock something. But I don't see a lock.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to break a wall. If I can make ""key is tool,"" then I can use it to destroy walls. But I don't see a ""tool"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you."" So, I control Baba. The other rules are ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" and ""key."" I can move these rules to create new rules.

Maybe I can create a rule that makes the ball move towards the win. For example, ""ball is push."" Then, I can push the ball towards the win.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so when I reach the ball, I win. But the ball is closer, so that might not help.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I can reach it and win. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" The ""ball"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. That's a long distance, but maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule towards ""win.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule towards the ""ball"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to both ""ball"" and ""win"" to create ""ball is win."" But I need to position them correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball move by itself. If I can make ""ball is move,"" then it will move on its own. But I don't see a ""move"" rule.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""key"" rule and see if I can create a new rule there.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so when I reach the win position, I win. But I'm already supposed to win by reaching the win, so that might not help.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule that makes the walls passable. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" so walls disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""key"" rule and see what happens. Let me try to move left and up to reach the key.

Wait, the key is at 1 left, 1 up. So, from my current position, I need to move left once and up once. Let me try that.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking me. Let me check the walls. There's a wall at 3 right, 5 up; 3 right, 4 up; etc. But moving left and up, I might not hit any walls.

So, I'll try to move left first, then up. Let's see.

First, move left. Then, move up. That should get me to the key.

Once I'm at the key, maybe I can pick it up and use it to create a new rule. For example, ""key is win,"" so I can win by reaching the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to break a wall. But I don't see a lock, so I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can make ""key is win,"" then I can win by reaching the key. That might be a quicker way.

So, how do I create ""key is win""? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" The ""key"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule up, it can be next to ""win.""

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down instead.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to both ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure how to position them correctly.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up step by step until it's next to ""win."" Let me plan that.

First, move the ""key"" rule up once. Then, again, until it's at 8 right, 5 up, next to ""win."" Then, I can create ""key is win.""

But I need to make sure I can move the ""key"" rule. Since it's a rule block, I can move it as long as it's not stopped by something.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is.

But that's also a lot of steps.

Hmm, this is taking too long. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so when I reach the win position, I win. But I'm already supposed to win by reaching the win, so that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is jump,"" so I can jump over walls. But I don't see a ""jump"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is push,"" so I can push objects. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""key"" rule and see if I can create a new rule there.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball somehow. The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can make it move towards the win, that might help.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is push,"" so I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so when I reach the ball, I win. But the ball is closer, so that might not help.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""key"" rule and see what happens.

So, I'll move left once, then up once to reach the key. Let's try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 5 step up."" So, the win condition is at (9 right, 5 up). That's pretty far to the right and up. To get there, I might need to move through the map, but there are walls in the way.

I also notice a ""key"" object at (1 step up). Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" which might mean that the key is involved in a rule that could help me.

The ball is at (2 steps to the right and 4 step up). I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of a rule that can help me move or change something.

I see several ""rule `is`"" blocks, which are essential because they define the rules. For example, ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 5 step up"" is part of the ""WIN"" rule. If I can move these ""is"" blocks, I can change the rules.

The ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" might be making some walls immovable. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make the walls movable or remove their stopping property.

I also notice ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" and ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 1 step down."" These might be defining what Baba and You are, but since ""baba is you"" is active, I'm already controlling Baba.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls movable or to change the win condition. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or to make the key the new win condition.

Let me try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block. If I can move it away, the walls might no longer stop me. Alternatively, I could move an ""is"" block to create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something that allows me to move walls.

Wait, I see ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up."" Maybe the ball can be used to push walls if I can make it part of a rule. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to move walls out of the way.

But first, I need to get to the ball. The ball is at (2 right, 4 up). I'm currently at (0,0), so I need to move right twice and up four times. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls' positions.

There's a wall at (4 right, 5 up), which is in the way of the win condition. Another wall at (4 right, 4 up), and so on. These walls are blocking my path. If I can move them, I can clear the way.

I think the best approach is to move the ""rule `stop`"" block so that walls are no longer stop. If I can do that, I can walk through walls. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes walls movable.

Looking at the ""rule `stop`"" at (1 right, 4 up), I can try to move it. But to move it, I need to be adjacent to it. So I need to move right once and up four times. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can find another way.

Alternatively, I can try to move an ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can move ""is"" to be next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can make ""wall is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Maybe I can create it.

Wait, I see ""rule `ball`"" at (5 right, 3 up). If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to push walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""ball"" and ""push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block to change the rule. If I move it away, maybe the walls stop being stop. Let me try to move it.

I need to get to the ""rule `stop`"" at (1 right, 4 up). To get there, I need to move right once and up four times. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around.

Looking at the map, I see walls at (4 right, 5 up), (4 right, 4 up), etc. Maybe I can go up first and then right. Let me try moving up five times to get past the walls, but that might not work.

Alternatively, I can try to move left or down, but I don't see any objects there. Maybe I need to find another way.

Wait, I see the key at (1 step up). Maybe I can pick up the key first. If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks something. But I'm not sure how yet.

I think the key is at (1 up), so I can move up once to get it. But I need to check if there's a wall blocking me. The wall is at (4 right, 5 up), so moving up once should be clear. Let me try that.

After moving up once, I have the key. Now, maybe I can use the key to change a rule. But I'm not sure how. Maybe the key is part of a rule that can help me.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block. Let me see if I can get there. It's at (1 right, 4 up). I need to move right once and up four times. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move up first to avoid them.

I move up four times, but I hit a wall at (0,4). Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I need to find another path.

Wait, I see a wall at (4 right, 5 up). If I can move that wall, I can clear the path. But to move it, I need to change the rule. Maybe I can make ""wall is push"" by moving an ""is"" block.

I see ""rule `is`"" at (8 right, 5 up). If I can move that ""is"" block to be next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can create ""wall is push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block to change the rule. If I can move it away, the walls might stop being stop. Let me try to move it.

I need to get to the ""rule `stop`"" at (1 right, 4 up). To get there, I need to move right once and up four times. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can go around.

I see that the walls are at (4 right, 5 up), (4 right, 4 up), etc. Maybe I can move up to (0,5) and then right to (1,5), but I don't see a wall there. Let me try that.

I move up five times to (0,5), then right once to (1,5). Now I'm next to the ""rule `stop`"" at (1 right, 4 up). Wait, that's one step down from where I am. So I can move down once to reach it.

Now I'm at (1,4), next to the ""rule `stop`"" block. I can move it. Let me move it down to (1,3). Now the rule ""stop"" is at (1,3). Does that change anything? Maybe the walls are no longer stop.

If the walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. Let me try moving right to (4,4), which was previously blocked by a wall. If I can pass through, that would help.

I move right three times to (4,4). If the walls are passable now, I can continue moving right and up towards the win condition.

Alternatively, if the walls are still blocking me, I might need to find another way. Maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block further away or create a new rule.

Wait, I think moving the ""rule `stop`"" block might have changed the rule. Now, the rule is ""stop"" at (1,3), but I'm not sure if that affects the walls. Maybe I need to create a new rule that makes walls not stop.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule like ""wall is push"" by moving an ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

I see ""rule `is`"" at (8 right, 5 up). If I can move that ""is"" block to be next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can create ""wall is push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `ball`"" block to create a new rule with the ball. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to push walls.

The ""rule `ball`"" is at (5 right, 3 up). If I can move the ""is"" block next to it, I can create a new rule. Let me try that.

I move the ""is"" block at (3 right, 2 up) next to ""ball"" at (5 right, 3 up). Now, the rule becomes ""ball is [something]."" But I need to define what ""is"" applies to. Maybe I can make ""ball is push.""

But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block. Alternatively, I can use the key to change a rule.

I have the key at (1 up). Maybe I can use it to change a rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition, and I can win by picking it up.

But I already have the key. Maybe I can create a rule like ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win."" Let me try that.

I move the ""is"" block at (1 right, 2 up) next to ""key"" at (1 up). Now, the rule becomes ""key is [something]."" If I can make it ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

But I need to have ""win"" next to it. The ""win"" rule is at (9 right, 5 up). That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I already am ""baba is you,"" so that might not work.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then when I reach the win condition, I win. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the best approach is to make ""key is win"" so that I can win by picking up the key. Let me try that.

I move the ""is"" block at (1 right, 2 up) next to ""key"" at (1 up). Now, the rule is ""key is [something]."" I need to have ""win"" next to it, but ""win"" is too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block and the ""win"" block next to ""key."" But that's too far.

Maybe I can make ""key is you,"" which would make the key controllable. But I already control Baba.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is push,"" so I can push walls with the key. But I'm not sure if that helps.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block further away to see if that helps.

I move the ""rule `stop`"" block from (1,3) to (1,2). Now, the rule is ""stop"" at (1,2). Maybe that changes the walls' properties.

If the walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. Let me try moving right to (4,4). If I can pass through, that would help.

I move right three times to (4,4). If the walls are passable, I can continue moving right and up towards the win condition.

Alternatively, if the walls are still blocking me, I might need to find another way. Maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block further away or create a new rule.

Wait, I think moving the ""rule `stop`"" block might have changed the rule. Now, the rule is ""stop"" at (1,2), but I'm not sure if that affects the walls. Maybe I need to create a new rule that makes walls not stop.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule like ""wall is push"" by moving an ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

I see ""rule `is`"" at (8 right, 5 up). If I can move that ""is"" block to be next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" I can create ""wall is push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""rule `ball`"" block to create a new rule with the ball. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to push walls.

The ""rule `ball`"" is at (5 right, 3 up). If I can move the ""is"" block next to it, I can create a new rule. Let me try that.

I move the ""is"" block at (3 right, 2 up) next to ""ball"" at (5 right, 3 up). Now, the rule becomes ""ball is [something]."" But I need to define what ""is"" applies to. Maybe I can make ""ball is push.""

But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block. Alternatively, I can use the key to change a rule.

I have the key at (1 up). Maybe I can use it to change a rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition, and I can win by picking it up.

But I already have the key. Maybe I can create a rule like ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win."" Let me try that.

I move the ""is"" block at (1 right, 2 up) next to ""key"" at (1 up). Now, the rule is ""key is [something]."" If I can make it ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

But I need to have ""win"" next to it. The ""win"" rule is at (9 right, 5 up). That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then when I reach the win condition, I win. But I already am ""baba is you,"" so that might not work.

I think the best approach is to make ""key is win"" so that I can win by picking up the key. Let me try that.

I move the ""is"" block at (1 right, 2 up) next to ""key"" at (1 up). Now, the rule is ""key is [something]."" I need to have ""win"" next to it, but ""win"" is too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block and the ""win"" block next to ""key."" But that's too far.

Maybe I can make ""key is you,"" which would make the key controllable. But I already control Baba.

Alternatively, I can make ""key is push,"" so I can push walls with the key. But I'm not sure if that helps.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""rule `stop`"" block further away to see if that helps.

I move the ""rule `stop`"" block from (1,3) to (1,2). Now, the rule is ""stop"" at (1,2). Maybe that changes the walls' properties.

If the walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. Let me try moving right to (4,4). If I can pass through, that would help.

I move right three times to (4,4). If the walls are passable, I can continue moving right and up towards the win condition.

Alternatively, if the walls are still blocking me, I might need to find another way. Maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block further away or create a new rule.

Wait, I think moving the ""rule `stop`"" block might have changed the rule. Now, the rule is ""stop"" at (1,2), but I'm not sure if that affects the walls. Maybe I need to create a new rule that makes walls not stop.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule like ""wall is push"" by moving an ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule yet. Maybe I can create it by moving another ""is"" block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step up. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something. There are several walls and other rules scattered around.

I notice there's a ""ball"" 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. Also, there are multiple ""is"" rules, which might allow me to create new rules by moving them around.

I should think about how to manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move a ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. Maybe I can make ""ball is win"" so that the ball becomes the win condition, making it easier to reach.

But first, I need to get to the ball. Let me see the path. There are walls in the way, but maybe I can move some rules to remove the walls. For instance, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, I have a ""key"" nearby. Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the key can be used to change a rule.

I should also consider the ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I can make ""stop is you,"" then I could potentially stop myself, but that doesn't seem useful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately, but I don't see how to do that right now.

Let me think about the movement. I'm currently at the starting position. To reach the ball, I need to move right and up. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move some rules to remove the walls.

Wait, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule to make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule, so that might not work.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to the wall to create a new rule. For example, moving an ""is"" rule next to the wall to make ""wall is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. It's only 1 step up, so I can move up to get it. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock a path or change a rule.

So, my plan is to move up to get the key. Then, I can see if the key allows me to do something else, like move through walls or change rules.

Wait, but the key is just an object. Maybe I need to create a rule involving the key. For example, ""key is win"" would make the key the win condition, so I just need to pick it up.

But I don't see a ""key is win"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to the key.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is too far. Maybe I can bring it closer by creating a new rule.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to move up to get the key first. That seems like a straightforward step.

So, I'll choose the ""up"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The rules are spread out, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to help me win.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. It's 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. To get there, I might need to break some walls or change the rules to make movement easier.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule near me, which probably makes walls immovable. If I can move that rule away, maybe I can break through walls. Also, there's a ""ball"" rule and a ""key"" rule. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, or the key can unlock a path.

I see that the ""baba"" rule is two steps down and to the left, and the ""you"" rule is two steps down and to the right. If I can move these, I might be able to change what Baba is or create a new rule that helps me.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the ""WIN"" rule, but walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule so that walls become passable. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes Baba able to pass through walls.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule, the walls might become movable or passable. Let me try moving towards the ""stop"" rule. It's one step to the right and three steps up. So I need to move right and up to get there.

But before I do that, I should check if there are any other useful rules nearby. There's a ""ball"" rule five steps to the right and two steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to push the ""stop"" rule. Or perhaps I can make the ball into something else.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by moving ""baba"" and ""you"" closer. If I can make ""baba is key"" or ""baba is ball,"" that might help me interact with the environment differently.

Let me try moving towards the ""stop"" rule. I'll go right and up step by step. Once I'm next to it, I can move it somewhere else, maybe down or to the side, to deactivate it. That should make the walls passable.

After moving the ""stop"" rule, I can then move through the walls towards the ""WIN"" rule. I need to be careful not to get stuck or move into a dead end.

Another thought: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable, then navigate to the ""WIN"" rule. Let me start moving towards the ""stop"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The key is one step to the left, which might be important. The rules are spread out, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I think the key is probably needed to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. The walls are all around, so I need to figure out how to move through them. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules.

I notice there are several ""is"" rules. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""ball"" rule next to ""is,"" I might make ""ball is something."" That could change the ball's properties.

The key is close to me, so maybe I should pick it up first. But to get the key, I might need to move left. Let me check the surrounding walls. There's a wall one step to the left and three steps up, but I'm not sure if that's blocking me.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so I can move left to get it. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking that path. The observation says there's a wall three steps to the right and two steps down, but that's not directly in my way. So, moving left should be possible.

After getting the key, I can think about how to use it. Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or change a rule. Alternatively, I could use the key to break a wall or change the win condition.

Another idea is to look for the ""win"" rule. It's nine steps to the right and four steps up. If I can reach that, maybe I can change the win condition to something else, like ""key is win,"" which would let me win by picking up the key.

But to get to the ""win"" rule, I need to move right a lot, which might be blocked by walls. Maybe I can break the walls by changing their properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but if I can change that, maybe I can make walls passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall to make ""wall is stop,"" but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Or maybe I can make ""baba is wall"" to turn myself into a wall, but that doesn't seem useful.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, which might let me interact with something else. Or maybe ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key.

I think the best approach is to first move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can look for ways to use it to change the rules or unlock something. So, I'll choose the ""left"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is probably to reach the win condition, but I need to figure out how.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There are also several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, and a rule ""win"" 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Hmm, maybe I can use these to change the rules.

I see a ball 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I can move towards it or use it somehow. There's also a rule ""ball"" 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the ball do something else.

Wait, there's a key 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That might be important. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. But how do I get there? There are walls in the way.

I also notice a rule ""stop"" 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or prevent it from blocking me.

Let me think about the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. I need to see if I can create a new rule by moving a rule block. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to another word, I can create a new rule.

Looking at the positions, the rule ""is"" is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that next to ""ball,"" maybe I can make ""ball is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But how do I do that?

Wait, there's a rule ""you"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move that next to ""baba,"" maybe I can change the rule to ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball or the key. Let me see, the ball is 2 steps right and 3 up. If I move right twice and up three times, I can reach it. But are there walls blocking me?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps right and 4 up, which is in the way. Maybe I can move around it. Alternatively, if I can change the rules to make the walls passable.

Wait, there's a rule ""stop"" 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that next to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop being a wall. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to ""stop"" to make ""stop is something."" But I'm not sure what that would achieve.

I think I need to try moving towards the ball first. Let me try moving right twice and up three times to get to the ball. Maybe that will help me figure out the next step.

But wait, the ball is 2 steps right and 3 up. So from my current position, I need to move right twice and up three times. Let me plan that out.

First, move right once, then right again, then up three times. That should get me to the ball. Once there, maybe I can use it to change the rules or do something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule block to create a new rule. The ""ball"" rule is 5 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that next to ""is,"" I can make ""ball is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should just try moving towards the ball and see what happens.

Wait, there's also a key 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock the win condition. But how?

I think I need to focus on the ball first. Let me try moving right twice and up three times to reach it. That should be the first step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The ""WIN"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a ""key"" object at 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening something or changing rules.

I notice that there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 4 up, and a ""rule `win`"" at 8 right and 4 up. Maybe I can move these to create new rules or modify existing ones. Since I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP,"" I need to make sure I can move these rule blocks.

The ball is at 1 step right and 3 up. Maybe I can use the ball to push something or create a new rule involving it. The key is at 1 step left, so perhaps I can pick it up and use it elsewhere.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can rearrange them to change what Baba is. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could potentially pick up the key and use it to unlock something.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get closer to the ""WIN"" rule. To do that, I might need to move some walls or rule blocks out of the way. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or change my properties.

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop moving or prevent it from blocking me. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Another idea: if I can move the ""rule `ball`"" at 4 steps right and 2 up, maybe I can make the ball do something else, like become a win condition or a key. That could be useful.

I also see that there's a ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can change what ""you"" is, which would affect how I move or interact with the environment.

Hmm, maybe I should start by moving towards the key. If I can pick up the key, I might be able to use it to unlock a path or change a rule. The key is only 1 step to the left, so that's an easy move.

But wait, I'm currently at a position where I can move left, right, up, or down. Let me check the surrounding walls. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 up, which is in the way of the ""WIN"" rule. Maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `is`"" blocks to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or move more freely. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I could push walls out of the way.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me see if I can move any of the rule blocks. The ""rule `is`"" at 7 right and 4 up is close to the ""WIN"" rule. Maybe I can move it to create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition something I can reach.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would automatically win when I reach the ""WIN"" object. That might be a way to solve the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" block next to Baba. But the ""rule `win`"" is at 8 right and 4 up, which is quite far. I might need to move other rule blocks to create a path or change my movement abilities.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `you`"" block to change what ""you"" is. If I can make ""you is key,"" then I could pick up the key and use it to unlock something else.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. If I can pick it up, I might have more options. The key is only 1 step to the left, so I can move left to get it.

Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to move other rule blocks or open a locked path. But I'm not sure how the key interacts with the rules yet.

Another thought: the ""rule `ball`"" is at 4 right and 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the ball do something useful, like push walls or become a win condition.

I think I'll start by moving left to pick up the key. That seems like a straightforward first step. Once I have the key, I can see if it helps me move other objects or change rules.

So, my plan is to move left to get the key. Then, I'll assess the situation again and see how to proceed from there.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is 9 steps right and 4 up from my current position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can get there by moving through the map.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. There's a ""ball"" 2 steps right and 3 up. I wonder if the ball is part of a rule that can help me.

The rules are all over the place. For example, there's a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up."" Maybe if I move the ""ball"" rule next to the ball object, I can change its properties. Similarly, there's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe moving the key next to its rule can do something.

I also see ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If I can make something stop, maybe I can block a path or create a new one. But I'm not sure how that helps me right now.

My main goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object. To do that, I need to figure out the path. Let me visualize the map. Starting from my position, I have walls to the right and up. I need to move around them. Maybe I can move left or down to find a way through.

Wait, I see a ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down."" If I move Baba's rule, I can change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching myself, but that might not be useful. Alternatively, if I make ""baba is key,"" I can pick up the key and maybe unlock something.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is 1 step to the left. Let me try moving left. But I have a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 up, so maybe moving left is blocked. Wait, no, the walls are at different positions. Let me check again.

Looking at the walls, they are at various positions, but I don't see a wall directly to the left of me. So, maybe I can move left to get the key. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock a path to the win object.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to a different object, I can change what counts as winning. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think about the rules again. The ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba. If I can change Baba's properties, I might be able to move through walls or other obstacles.

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If I can make something stop, maybe I can block a path or create a new one. But I'm not sure how that helps me right now.

I think the key is to get the key first. So, I'll try moving left to pick it up. Let me check if that's possible. The key is 1 step to the left, and I don't see a wall blocking that path. So, I'll move left.

After moving left, I have the key. Now, what can I do with it? Maybe there's a locked door or another rule that requires the key. Looking at the objects, I don't see a door, but perhaps moving the key next to a rule can change something.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to move a rule. For example, if I move the key next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level. But I already have the key, so that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can use myself as a key to unlock something.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the key object. The ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is far away, but if I can bring it closer, I might be able to change the key's properties.

But moving rules requires moving the text blocks, which I can do by moving Baba next to them and then moving them. So, perhaps I should first move to the ""key"" rule and bring it next to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to a different object to change the win condition. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. My main goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object, which is 9 right and 4 up. That's a long way, but maybe I can find a shortcut by changing the rules.

Wait, there's a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up."" If I can make the ball into a win condition, I can reach it sooner. So, I'll try moving the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from its current position to next to the ball. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up, and the ball is 2 right and 3 up. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule left and down.

But moving rules requires moving them one step at a time. I'll need to plan a path to bring the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball next to the ""win"" rule. The ball is 2 right and 3 up, and the ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to make ""baba is win."" If I can change the rule to ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching myself, which is already the case. But that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can use myself as a key to unlock something. But I'm not sure what's locked.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls will stop me, which they already do, so that might not help. Alternatively, making ""wall is you"" would let me move through walls, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, I see a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If I can make something stop, maybe I can block a path or create a new one. But I'm not sure how.

I think the best approach is to try to change the win condition to something closer. So, I'll try to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. That way, reaching the ball will win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 9 right and 4 up to next to the ball at 2 right and 3 up. That's a distance of 7 left and 1 down. I'll need to move the rule step by step.

But moving rules requires moving them one step at a time, and I need to plan a path. Let me see if there's a clear path to move the ""win"" rule left and down without hitting walls.

Looking at the walls, they are positioned at various points, but I think I can move the ""win"" rule left and down without hitting any walls. So, I'll start by moving the ""win"" rule left.

But wait, I can't move the rule directly. I need to move Baba next to the rule and then move the rule. So, first, I need to get Baba next to the ""win"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's far, but maybe I can move right and up to get there. Let me check the path. I have walls at 4 right and 4 up, so I might be blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me try moving up to see if I can get around the walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, so if I move up first, I might hit a wall. Maybe I should move right first.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make ""baba is key"" so I can pick up the key and use it somehow.

The ""key"" rule is 9 right and 1 up. That's far, but if I can move the ""key"" rule next to the key object, I can change the key's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to Baba to make ""baba is key."" That way, I can use myself as a key.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Maybe I can then move through a locked door or something, but I don't see a door in the objects.

Wait, perhaps the key is needed to unlock the win condition. If I have the key, maybe I can move it next to the ""win"" rule to change it.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. So, I'll move left to pick up the key.

After moving left, I have the key. Now, what can I do with it? Maybe I can move it next to a rule to change something.

Looking at the rules, the ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is far away. Maybe I can bring it closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key next to the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win,"" so reaching the key would win the level. But I already have the key, so that might not help.

Wait, if I make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. Since I have the key, I might already be winning, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" to use myself as a key. But I'm not sure what that unlocks.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving the ""win"" rule next to the ball to make ""ball is win."" That way, reaching the ball would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 9 right and 4 up to next to the ball at 2 right and 3 up. That's a distance of 7 left and 1 down. I'll need to move the rule step by step.

But moving rules requires moving them one step at a time, and I need to plan a path. Let me see if there's a clear path to move the ""win"" rule left and down without hitting walls.

Looking at the walls, they are positioned at various points, but I think I can move the ""win"" rule left and down without hitting any walls. So, I'll start by moving the ""win"" rule left.

But wait, I can't move the rule directly. I need to move Baba next to the rule and then move the rule. So, first, I need to get Baba next to the ""win"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's far, but maybe I can move right and up to get there. Let me check the path. I have walls at 4 right and 4 up, so I might be blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me try moving up to see if I can get around the walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, so if I move up first, I might hit a wall. Maybe I should move right first.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba.

But that would require moving the ""win"" rule to where Baba is, which is 0,0. That's a long way, and I'm not sure if it's possible without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" and then use the key to move the ""win"" rule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I have the key now. Maybe I can use it to move a rule. For example, if I move the key next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can change the win condition.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can make ""key is win,"" but I already have the key. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""win is key,"" so the win condition becomes the key.

But I'm not sure if that helps. I think I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to simplify.

My goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object. It's 9 right and 4 up. I need to find a path there, possibly by changing rules to remove obstacles or change the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" so I can win by staying where I am, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would already be winning, but I don't think that's the case. Let me check the active rules. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball to make ""ball is win."" That way, reaching the ball would win the level, which is closer than the current win condition.

So, I'll plan to move the ""win"" rule from 9 right and 4 up to next to the ball at 2 right and 3 up. That's 7 left and 1 down. I'll need to move the rule step by step, but I need to make sure the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball next to the ""win"" rule. The ball is 2 right and 3 up, and the ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's a distance of 7 right and 1 up. That might be easier.

But moving the ball requires moving it one step at a time, and I need to plan a path. Let me see if I can move the ball right and up to reach the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ball is at 2 right and 3 up. To get it to 9 right and 4 up, I need to move it 7 right and 1 up. That's a long way, but maybe possible.

But I'm not sure if that's the best use of my time. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""win"" rule instead.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball and move it to the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can switch control to the ball. That might help me reach the win condition more easily.

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to the ball. The ""ball"" rule is 5 right and 2 up, and the ball is 2 right and 3 up. So, I need to move the ""ball"" rule left and up.

But moving rules requires moving them one step at a time. Let me see if I can move the ""ball"" rule left and up to next to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ball next to the ""ball"" rule. The ball is 2 right and 3 up, and the ""ball"" rule is 5 right and 2 up. So, I need to move the ball right and down.

But I'm not sure if that's possible without hitting walls.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball to make ""ball is win."" That way, reaching the ball would win the level.

So, I'll start by moving the ""win"" rule left. To do that, I need to get Baba next to the ""win"" rule and then move it left.

The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. That's far, but I'll try to move right and up to get there. Let me check the path.

I have walls at 4 right and 4 up, so moving right to 4 right would hit a wall. Maybe I can move up first to avoid that.

Wait, if I move up first, I can go around the wall. Let me try moving up to 4 up, then right to 9 right. But I have walls at 4 right and 4 up, so I might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to 4 right, but that's a wall. So, I can't go that way.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another path. Let me see if I can move up to 5 up and then right. But I don't see walls at 5 up, so maybe that's possible.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, so moving up to 5 up and then right to 9 right might work. Let me try that.

So, I'll move up to 5 up, then right to 9 right. Now, I'm next to the ""win"" rule. I can move it left to 8 right and 4 up.

Now, the ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. I'll move it left again to 7 right and 4 up. I'll keep moving it left until it's next to the ball at 2 right and 3 up.

But this will take several steps, and I need to make sure I don't hit any walls. Let me check the path again.

After moving the ""win"" rule left from 9 right to 8 right, then to 7 right, and so on, I need to make sure there are no walls in the way. It seems possible since the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, so moving left from 9 right to 2 right should be clear.

Once the ""win"" rule is next to the ball, the rule becomes ""ball is win,""","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which might be useful for creating new rules by moving them around.

I see a ""key"" object 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. There's also a ""ball"" that's 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to break walls or something.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but since ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have a ""stop"" property. Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So if I move into a wall that's defined as ""stop,"" I can't pass through it. I need to avoid those or find a way to change their properties.

I also see a ""rule `baba`"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that to change what Baba is. If I can make Baba something else, like a ball or a key, that might help me progress.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm trying to reach the win condition, I probably need to move towards it. But the win is 9 steps to the right and 4 up, which is quite a distance. Maybe I should start moving right to get closer.

Alternatively, maybe I should collect the key first. The key is 1 step left and 1 up from my current position. If I move left, I can pick up the key, which might unlock a path or change a rule.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving away from the win. I need to balance between getting the key and moving towards the win. Maybe I should first check if there are any immediate obstacles.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 up, which is in the direction of the win. That might block my path. If I can change the wall's properties, maybe I can pass through it. For example, if I can make the wall ""stop,"" it would block me, but if I can make it something else, like ""you,"" I could pass through.

I see a ""rule `wall`"" 1 step to the left and 3 up. If I can move that rule, I might be able to redefine what a wall is. For instance, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and another property, I could create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you,"" allowing me to interact with walls differently.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule. There are multiple ""is"" rules on the map. The closest one is 3 steps to the right and 2 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, I can create a new rule. However, moving rules requires that they are not ""stop"" or immovable.

I also notice that there's a ""rule `you`"" 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can change what ""you"" is, that might give me new abilities. For example, making ""you is jump"" or ""you is pass.""

But right now, my main goal is to reach the win. Let me try to move towards it. Since the win is to the right and up, I should probably move right first. Let me try moving right.

Wait, but if I move right, I might hit a wall. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 up, which is in the way. Maybe I can go around it. Alternatively, if I can make the wall passable, that would help.

I think the best approach is to move towards the win, but I need to be cautious of walls and other obstacles. Let me try moving right to start.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder what the ball does.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" The walls are placed in various positions, so I need to be careful not to hit them. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, which might mean that if I move into that area, I can't move further.

I think the strategy here is to move towards the key first. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule or unlock a path. Let me plan my steps. I'm currently at the starting position, so I need to move right and up to reach the key.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. So maybe I should move left first. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are 3 steps to the right and various steps up, so moving left might be safer.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to avoid the walls. Let me visualize the map. The walls are spread out, so moving up could help me navigate around them. If I move up, I can then move right towards the key.

Another thought: if I can move the ""is"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule that helps me. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and maybe change the win condition.

But first, I need to get closer to the key. Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I can get closer to the key's position. Then, I can move up to reach it. Alternatively, moving up first might avoid any immediate walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I move up 3 steps, I might get stuck. So maybe I should move up 2 steps instead, then move right. That way, I can avoid the stop area.

Let me outline my steps:
1. Move right to get closer to the key.
2. Move up to avoid walls and reach the key's position.
3. Once I have the key, see if I can use it to change a rule.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to get a better path. Let me try moving up first. If I move up, I can then move right towards the key without hitting walls.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so maybe I should move left first. But I need to check if there's a wall in that direction. The walls are 3 steps to the right, so moving left might be clear.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I can get closer to the key and the win condition. Then, I can adjust my path based on the walls.

So, I think the best first move is to move right. That way, I can start heading towards the key and the win condition without immediately hitting any walls.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably where I need to go. But there are walls in the way. I also see a ""key"" object two steps to the left. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something.

The ball is three steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. Maybe it's part of a rule that can help me. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left and three steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls stop being obstacles.

I think the strategy here is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Since I can move text blocks, I should try to rearrange them. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop being a wall, allowing me to pass through.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get closer to the key first. It's two steps to the left, so I should move left twice. Then, maybe I can use the key to interact with other rules. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""win is something,"" which could change the win condition. Or perhaps I can make ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition.

But first, I need to get to the key. Let me try moving left to reach it. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to break through walls or change other rules.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it stop being a wall. That might clear a path for me. Let me see where the walls are. There's a wall two steps to the right and four steps up. If I can make that wall stop, I can pass through.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving up to get closer to the ""win"" rule. If I move up four steps, I'll be near the ""win"" rule. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to make those walls passable.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and maybe use it to unlock something. Or if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, which might help in some way.

I think the best first step is to move towards the key. Let me move left twice to get to the key. Once I have the key, I can see what options I have next.

I notice there are several walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are in various positions, some to the right and up, others down. There are also ""is"" rules and ""ball"" rules. I think I can move the ""is"" rules to create new rules by combining them with other objects.

Wait, the ""key"" is only 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move towards it. But before that, I should check if I can manipulate any rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make Baba able to pass through walls, that would help.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""wall"" rule 2 steps to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the properties of walls. But I'm not sure how yet.

I also see a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that, perhaps I can stop certain objects from moving or affecting me. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

The ""ball"" rule is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or create a new rule. But I'm not sure how to utilize it yet.

I think the key is to get the key first. It's only 1 step to the left, so maybe I can move left to pick it up. But I need to make sure that moving left is possible without hitting any walls or other obstacles.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

I also see a ""you"" rule 2 steps down. Maybe that's related to the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can manipulate that, perhaps I can change the win condition or something else.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving left to get the key. Let me see if that's possible. If I move left, will I hit any walls? The walls are 3 steps to the right and various steps up and down, so moving left from my current position might be clear.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to get closer to the win condition. But that's quite far, and there might be walls in the way.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a long way. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition, like the key. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best course of action is to move left to get the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a path or create a new rule that helps me reach the win condition more easily.

So, I'll choose to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is at (9,4). To get there, I need to navigate through the map, avoiding or moving walls if possible.

I also notice a ""key"" object at (1 step to the left). Maybe the key is needed to unlock something, but I'm not sure yet. There's a ""ball"" at (2 steps to the right and 3 step up). Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break things.

The rules are important here. I can move the rule blocks to change the game's rules. For example, if I move a ""stop"" rule, I can make walls stop being solid, allowing me to pass through them. Alternatively, I could change what ""WIN"" means by rearranging those rules.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move towards the win condition. The walls are at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), and (4,-1). That seems like a vertical line of walls at x=4. I need to get around them.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to make the walls passable. The ""stop"" rule is at (1 step to the right and 3 step up). If I move it somewhere else, maybe the walls won't stop me. Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule to change their properties.

Another idea: if I can make Baba into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to push through walls or move differently. The ""ball"" rule is at (5,2). If I can create a new rule like ""baba is ball,"" I could gain the ball's properties.

Wait, but I'm already ""baba is you,"" so I can move normally. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, the walls might no longer block me.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. It's at (1 right, 3 up). If I move it down, say to (1 right, 2 up), then the walls might not have the ""stop"" property anymore. That would allow me to pass through them.

Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at (1 left, 3 up). If I move it to a different location, maybe the walls will change their behavior.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should first try to move the ""stop"" rule. Let me attempt that.

I need to move the ""stop"" rule from (1 right, 3 up) to somewhere else. Let's say I move it down to (1 right, 2 up). Now, the walls might not stop me. Then, I can move right past them.

Once I've done that, I can move towards the win condition. Let me check the path again. The win is at (9,4). If I can move right past the walls at x=4, I can proceed towards x=9.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might require me to be adjacent to it. So, I need to get next to the ""stop"" rule first. It's at (1 right, 3 up). From my current position, I need to move right once and up three times to reach it.

But I'm currently at (0,0). So, moving right once would take me to (1,0). Then, moving up three times would take me to (1,3), where the ""stop"" rule is. Then, I can pick it up and move it down to (1,2).

After that, the walls at x=4 might no longer stop me. I can then move right past them and proceed towards the win at (9,4).

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key. The key is at (1 left). If I pick it up, maybe I can unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned in the objects. So, perhaps the key isn't necessary right now.

Another thought: the ""ball"" is at (2 right, 3 up). If I can make Baba into a ball, I might be able to push the walls or other objects. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move the ""stop"" rule so that the walls don't block me. Let me try that.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Move up three times to (1,3) to reach the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the ""stop"" rule down to (1,2).
4. Then, move right past the walls at x=4.
5. Proceed towards the win at (9,4).

Let me start by moving right to (1,0).

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball is important.

The rules include ""wall is stop,"" which means walls can't be moved through. There's also a ""ball is you"" rule, which might mean I can control the ball if I get it. But right now, I'm Baba, so I can move around as long as I don't hit walls.

I need to figure out how to get to the win. Maybe I can move towards the key first. If I can pick up the key, perhaps it will help me unlock a path. Let me see where the key is: 1 step to the left. So I should move left.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. If I move left, I might be able to get the key. Let me try that. So, I'll move left once to pick up the key. Now, with the key, maybe I can open a door or something. But I don't see a door mentioned here. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""key"" rule 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe if I move the key there, I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something. That could change the win condition to the key, making it easier to reach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make ""ball is win,"" so the ball becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the movement.

I need to get closer to the win. The win is 8 steps right and 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move faster or teleport. For example, if I can make ""baba is teleport,"" I could skip some steps. But I don't see a teleport rule here.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" rule 4 steps right and 2 up. If I can make ""ball is you,"" I could control the ball and maybe move it to the win. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me try moving towards the key first. So, I'll move left once to get the key. Now, with the key, maybe I can move it to the ""key"" rule position. That might change the rule to ""key is something."" If I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition, and I can just pick it up.

So, I'll move the key to the rule position. That would be moving it 8 steps right and 1 step up from its current position. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I can break it down.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can make ""key is win."" That way, the key becomes the win condition, and I can just pick it up.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. I think I can only move text blocks if they're not ""stop."" So, I need to see if the ""is"" rule is movable. It says ""rule `is`"" in the objects, so I can move it.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" That way, I can form ""key is win."" So, I'll move the ""is"" rule from its current position to between ""key"" and ""win."" That should create the new rule.

Wait, but the ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 up. The ""key"" rule is at 8 right and 1 up. That's a big distance. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is. Or maybe move the ""is"" rule down to the ""key"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ""key"" is. That way, I can form ""key is win."" But I'm not sure if that's possible.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""ball"" rule to make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball and use it to reach the win.

The ""ball"" rule is at 5 steps right and 2 up. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""ball is you."" Then, I can control the ball and move it towards the win.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""ball"" rule. It's a text block, so I can move it if it's not ""stop."" Let me check the objects. The ""ball"" rule is listed, so I can move it.

I'll try moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you."" That should create ""ball is you,"" allowing me to control the ball. Once I have control of the ball, I can move it towards the win.

Wait, but the ball is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move the ball, I can bring it closer. But I'm not sure if I can move the ball itself or just the rule.

I think moving the rule will change the properties. So, if I make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes controllable. Then, I can move the ball towards the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so I just need to be where I am, but that doesn't make sense. I need to reach the win.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without moving so far. For example, ""baba is win"" would mean wherever I am, I win. But I don't know if that's possible.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm controlling Baba. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then being Baba would mean I win. But I don't see a way to do that directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to where I am. If I can bring the ""win"" rule next to me, then I can win without moving far.

But the ""win"" rule is 8 steps right and 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move it closer. Let me see if I can move the ""win"" rule.

Yes, it's a text block, so I can move it. I'll try moving it closer to me. Let's say I move it 3 steps left and 1 down. That would bring it closer. Then, I can move towards it.

Wait, but moving the ""win"" rule would change its position, but I'm not sure if that affects the win condition. Maybe the win condition is based on the rule's position.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition, like the key or the ball.

I think the key is 1 step left. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. That might be easier.

So, I'll try moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule. That way, I can form ""key is win."" Then, I just need to pick up the key.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's currently at 7 steps right and 4 up. I need to move it to between ""key"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is at 8 right and 1 up, and ""win"" is at 8 right and 4 up. So, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is.

Wait, that's a big move. Maybe I can break it down into smaller steps. First, move the ""is"" rule left once to 6 right and 4 up. Then, move it down step by step until it's next to the ""key"" rule.

But that would take several moves, and I'm not sure if I can do that in one step. Maybe I should try moving the ""key"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is.

The ""key"" rule is at 8 right and 1 up. If I move it up 3 steps, it would be at 8 right and 4 up, which is where the ""win"" rule is. Then, I can have ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""key"" rule that far. It might be too many steps. Maybe I can move it closer in smaller increments.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is. That way, I can form ""key is win"" without moving the ""key"" rule too far.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. If I move it down 3 steps, it would be at 8 right and 1 up, where the ""key"" rule is. Then, I can have ""key is win.""

That sounds better. So, I'll move the ""win"" rule down 3 steps. Now, it's at 8 right and 1 up, next to the ""key"" rule. Then, the ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 4 up. I need to move the ""is"" rule down to 8 right and 1 up as well.

Wait, but the ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 4 up. If I move it right once, it would be at 8 right and 4 up, which is where the ""win"" rule was. But I moved the ""win"" rule down. So, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to 8 right and 1 up.

That way, the ""is"" rule is between ""key"" and ""win,"" forming ""key is win."" Then, picking up the key would make me win.

So, I'll move the ""is"" rule from 7 right and 4 up to 8 right and 1 up. That's moving it right 1 and down 3 steps. But I can only move one step at a time. So, I'll have to do it in multiple steps.

But in this turn, I can only choose one action. So, maybe I should start by moving the ""win"" rule down. Let me try that.

I'll move the ""win"" rule down 3 steps. Now, it's at 8 right and 1 up. Then, I'll move the ""is"" rule right 1 and down 3 to be next to ""key"" and ""win."" But I can only do one action per turn.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule up 3 steps to meet the ""is"" rule. That would also form ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""win"" rule down first. So, I'll move the ""win"" rule down 3 steps.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So, I'll have to do it step by step. But in this turn, I can only choose one action. So, I'll choose to move the ""win"" rule down once.

But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think again.

I have the key 1 step left. If I can pick it up, maybe I can use it to change a rule. So, I'll move left once to get the key.

Now, I have the key. Maybe I can move the key to the ""key"" rule position to create ""key is something."" If I can make ""key is win,"" then I can win by picking up the key.

So, I'll move the key to the ""key"" rule position, which is 8 right and 1 up. That's a long way, but I'll start by moving right 7 steps and up 0 steps. Wait, that's too many steps. Maybe I can move right once this turn.

But I can only move one step at a time. So, I'll move right once towards the key rule.

Wait, but the key is already 1 step left. I'm at the starting position. So, moving left once would get me the key. Then, I can move the key towards the ""key"" rule.

So, first, I'll move left once to pick up the key. Then, in the next turns, I can move the key towards the ""key"" rule to create ""key is win.""

That seems like a plan. So, my first action is to move left once to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is at position (9 right, 4 up). That's pretty far to the right. I also see a ""key"" at 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I notice there's a ""ball"" at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. There's also a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which might mean that the key is involved in a rule that could help me reach the win condition.

The rules I can manipulate are:
- ""rule `is`"" at various positions
- ""rule `wall`"" at 1 step left and 3 up
- ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step right and 3 up
- ""rule `ball`"" at 5 steps right and 2 up
- ""rule `key`"" at 9 steps right and 1 up
- ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 2 down
- ""rule `you`"" at 1 step right and 2 down

I think I can move these rules to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I move ""rule `key`"" next to ""rule `is`,"" I could create ""key is something,"" which might make the key have a new property.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is at 1 step left. Since I'm Baba, I can move left. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking me. Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, but that's not in my immediate path. The walls at 4 steps right and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, and 2 steps down might be in the way if I move right, but I'm moving left to get the key.

Wait, the key is at 1 step left, so I can move left once to get it. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking me. The walls are mostly on the right side, so moving left should be clear.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a path or change a rule. Alternatively, I could use the ball to push something. The ball is at 2 right and 3 up. If I can move the ball to a position where it can push a wall or a rule, that might help.

Another idea is to change the rules to make walls passable or to make myself able to jump or something. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls out of the way.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `stop`"" at 1 right and 3 up. If I move that next to ""rule `is`,"" I could make ""stop is something,"" which might prevent certain objects from stopping me.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can see if there's a lock or another rule that requires it.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Wait, I see ""rule `you`"" at 1 right and 2 down. If I move that next to ""rule `is`,"" I could make ""you is something,"" which might change my properties. But I'm not sure what that would do.

Another approach is to use the ball to push a rule into a new position. For example, if I can push the ""rule `win`"" closer, I might be able to reach it without going all the way to the right.

But the ball is at 2 right and 3 up. I'm at the starting position, so I need to move right twice and up three times to get to the ball. That might take too long, and there might be walls in the way.

Hmm, maybe I should try to create a new rule that makes the walls passable. If I can move ""rule `wall`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `pass`,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Alternatively, I could make ""wall is nothing,"" which would remove the walls.

Wait, I see ""rule `stop`"" at 1 right and 3 up. If I move that next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `wall`,"" I could create ""wall is stop,"" which might make walls stop me, but that's already the case.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then walls won't stop me. To do that, I need to move ""rule `stop`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `nothing`,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Maybe I can create ""stop is you,"" which would make me stop when I hit a wall, but that's not helpful.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the win condition is at 9 right and 4 up. That's far to the right. I need to find a way to get there. The key is at 1 left, so maybe I need to go left, get the key, and then use it to unlock a path to the right.

Alternatively, I could try to create a rule that allows me to teleport or move faster. For example, ""baba is fast"" or something, but I don't see a ""fast"" rule.

Wait, I see ""rule `ball`"" at 5 right and 2 up. If I can move that next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `you`,"" I could make ""you is ball,"" which would make me a ball. Then, as a ball, I can bounce and maybe reach the win condition faster.

But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" and ""rule `you`"" next to each other. Let me see where they are. ""rule `ball`"" is at 5 right and 2 up, and ""rule `you`"" is at 1 right and 2 down. That's quite a distance apart. I might need to move other rules out of the way to create a path.

Alternatively, I could try to make the ball push the rules into position. If I can move the ball to a spot where it can push ""rule `ball`"" and ""rule `you`"" together, that might work.

But this seems too involved. Maybe I should try to get the key first. So, I'll move left once to pick up the key. Then, I can see if there's a lock or another rule that requires the key.

After getting the key, I can look for a ""lock"" rule or something that the key can interact with. If I can unlock a path, that might lead me closer to the win condition.

Alternatively, I could use the key to change a rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key itself becomes the win condition, and I can just pick it up to win. But I need to check if that's possible.

To do that, I need to move ""rule `key`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`."" ""rule `key`"" is at 9 right and 1 up, ""rule `is`"" is at 8 right and 4 up, and ""rule `win`"" is at 9 right and 4 up. So, if I can move ""rule `key`"" up to where ""rule `win`"" is, I can create ""key is win.""

But that requires moving ""rule `key`"" from 9 right and 1 up to 9 right and 4 up, which is three steps up. I need to see if there's a clear path for that. There are walls at 4 right and various up positions, but I'm on the left side, so maybe I can move up without interference.

Wait, I'm at the starting position, which is probably (0,0). The key is at 1 left, so I need to move left once to get it. Then, I can move up to where the rules are.

But I'm not sure if I can move the rules. I think only text blocks can be moved, and I can only move them if they're not defined as ""STOP."" So, I need to make sure that the rules I want to move aren't stopped.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls, making it easier to reach the key and the win condition.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""rule `you`"" to make myself something else. For example, if I can make ""you is ball,"" I can bounce around and reach the win condition faster.

To do that, I need to move ""rule `you`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `ball`."" ""rule `you`"" is at 1 right and 2 down, ""rule `is`"" is at 8 right and 4 up, and ""rule `ball`"" is at 5 right and 2 up. That's a long distance, and there are walls in the way.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the key again. If I get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or a path. But I don't see a door in the description. Alternatively, the key could be used to change a rule.

Wait, if I have the key, I can pick it up, and then maybe use it to push a rule into a new position. For example, if I can push ""rule `stop`"" to make it ""stop is something,"" which might help me move through walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the key next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`"" to make ""key is win."" That way, picking up the key would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the key from 1 left to 9 right and 4 up, where ""rule `win`"" is. But that's a long path, and I don't know if I can move the key that far.

Alternatively, I could try to create a rule that makes the key the win condition without moving it. But I'm not sure how.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me. If I can move it to a position where I can reach it without going all the way to the right, that would be easier.

But moving rules requires moving them step by step, and I need to make sure there's a clear path. I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am becomes the win condition. But I don't see a ""win"" rule near me. The ""rule `win`"" is at 9 right and 4 up.

Wait, if I can move ""rule `win`"" next to me, I can create ""baba is win."" But that would require moving ""rule `win`"" from 9 right and 4 up to where I am, which is probably (0,0). That's a long move, and I don't know if I can do that.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""you is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I need to move ""rule `you`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`."" That's also a long move.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the key and see what happens. So, I'll move left once to pick up the key. Then, I can see if I can use it to change a rule or unlock something.

After picking up the key, I can try to move it next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`"" to make ""key is win."" That way, I can just pick up the key to win.

But I need to make sure I can move the key that far. Let me see: from 1 left, I need to move right 10 times and up 3 times to get to 9 right and 4 up. That's a lot, and there might be walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, I could try to create a rule that allows me to teleport or move faster. But I don't see a ""teleport"" or ""fast"" rule here.

Wait, I see ""rule `ball`"" at 5 right and 2 up. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can become a ball and bounce to the win condition. To do that, I need to move ""rule `ball`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `you`.""

But ""rule `ball`"" is at 5 right and 2 up, and ""rule `you`"" is at 1 right and 2 down. That's a distance, but maybe I can move them closer.

Alternatively, I could try to push the ball to a position where it can help me move rules into place.

But this seems too complicated. Maybe I should try to get the key and see if that helps. So, I'll move left once to pick up the key.

After that, I can try to move the key next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`"" to make ""key is win."" That way, I can just pick up the key to win.

But I need to make sure I can move the key that far. Let me see: from 1 left, I need to move right 10 times and up 3 times to get to 9 right and 4 up. That's a lot, and there might be walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, I could try to create a rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, ""wall is pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Wait, I see ""rule `stop`"" at 1 right and 3 up. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then walls won't stop me. To do that, I need to move ""rule `stop`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `nothing`,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I could make ""stop is you,"" which would make me stop when I hit a wall, but that's not helpful.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to move the key and see what happens. So, I'll move left once to pick up the key.

After that, I can try to move the key next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`"" to make ""key is win."" That way, I can just pick up the key to win.

But I'm not sure if I can move the key that far. There might be walls in the way. Alternatively, I could try to create a rule that makes the key the win condition without moving it.

Wait, if I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. So, I just need to pick it up. But I need to move ""rule `key`"" next to ""rule `is`"" and then next to ""rule `win`.""

""rule `key`"" is at 9 right and 1 up, ""rule `is`"" is at 8 right and 4 up, and ""rule `win`"" is at 9 right and 4 up. So, I need to move ""rule `key`"" up to where ""rule `win`"" is.

But that requires moving ""rule `key`"" three steps up. I need to see if there's a clear path. There are walls at 4 right and various up positions, but I'm on the right side, so maybe I can move up without interference.

Alternatively, I could try to move ""rule `win`"" down to where ""rule `key`"" is. That way, I can create ""key is win"" without moving ""rule `key`"" too far.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe I should try to move ""rule `key`"" up to where ""rule `win`"" is.

So, I'll move ""rule `key`"" up three times to get it to 9 right and 4 up, where ""rule `win`"" is. Then, I can create ""key is win.""

But I need to make sure I can move ""rule `key`"" that far. Let me see: from 9 right and 1 up, moving up three times would take it to 9 right and 4 up, which is where ""rule `win`"" is. So, I can do that.

Once ""rule `key`"" is next to ""rule `win`,"" I can create ""key is win."" Then, picking up the key would make me win.

But I need to make sure that ""rule `key`"" is moved correctly. So, I'll move ""rule `key`"" up three times.

After that, I can pick up the key, and since ""key is win,"" I'll win the level.

But wait, I need to make sure that ""rule `key`"" is moved before I pick up the key. Otherwise, the rule won't be in place when I pick it up.

So, the steps would be:
1. Move ""rule `key`"" up three times to 9 right and 4 up.
2. Then, pick up the key, which is now the win condition.

But I'm not sure if I can move ""rule `key`"" while I'm at the starting position. Maybe I need to move other rules out of the way first.

Alternatively, I could try to move ""rule `win`"" down to where ""rule `key`"" is. That way, I can create ""key is win"" without moving ""rule `key`"" too","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is at (9,4). That's pretty far to the right and up. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way.

I also notice a ""key"" object at (1 step to the left). Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which might mean that the key can be used to change the win condition or something else.

The ball is at (2 steps to the right and 3 step up). I'm not sure what the ball does yet. There's a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" so maybe the ball has some property that can be changed.

I see several ""rule `is`"" blocks, which are essential because they define the rules. For example, ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 4 step up"" is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I move that, I could change the rule, but I have to be careful because that might make me unable to move.

The ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" suggests that there's a stop rule somewhere, which might prevent movement. I need to avoid that or use it to my advantage.

Looking at the ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down,"" that's another part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I move that, I could change what Baba is, which might help or hinder me.

The ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"" is also part of the main rule. Moving that could change what ""you"" is, which might affect how I move or interact with objects.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the win condition something I can reach. Maybe I can change the win condition to the key or the ball, which might be easier to obtain.

Alternatively, I could try to move the walls to create a path. But since walls are defined by ""rule `wall`,"" moving those might change their properties, making them passable or not.

I also notice that the ""rule `stop`"" is near the ball. If I can make the ball stop something, maybe I can block a wall or create a new path.

Wait, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. If I can move the key to the win position, then I can win by picking up the key. But how?

I need to move towards the key. It's at (1 step to the left). So, I should move left. But I'm currently at (0,0), so moving left might not be possible if there's a wall. Let me check the walls around me.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is far away. The walls near me are at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, and others. I think I can move left without hitting a wall immediately.

So, my plan is to move left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can see if I can change the win condition to something else or use the key to unlock a path.

But wait, moving left might not be the best idea if there's a wall there. Let me check the walls again. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, but that's not directly left of me. I think it's safe to move left.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to get closer to the win condition. But the win is at (9,4), which is far. I need to find a way to get there without being blocked.

Another idea: if I can change the ""baba is you"" rule to something else, I might gain new abilities. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I go, I win. But that might not be possible because I need to reach the win condition first.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block to a different position. If I can move it closer, I can reach it easier. But how do I move it? I need to have the ""is"" rule in the right place to change it.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. Let's try moving left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can see if I can use it to change the win condition or unlock a path.

So, I'll choose the ""left"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, and there are rules like ""wall is stop"" which probably means walls can't be moved through. The ball and key are also present, but I'm not sure how they factor in yet.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule to change the win condition to something closer or easier to reach. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would end the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" text block next to the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. But first, I need to figure out how to move those blocks. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" So, I need to check if the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are movable.

Looking at the rules, I don't see any ""is stop"" for the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks, so I think they can be moved. That means I can potentially rearrange them to form new rules.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the ""is"" block and the ""win"" block to create a new rule. The ""is"" block is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up, and the ""win"" block is next to it. I'm currently at the starting position, so I need to move right and up to reach them.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at 5 steps right and 4 up, which is where the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are. So I can't go through them. Maybe I can move the walls somehow, but since walls are ""stop,"" I can't move them. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable. If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I could walk through them. But I don't see a ""you"" block nearby. The ""you"" block is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down, which is below me. Maybe I can move down to get to it.

Wait, I'm at the starting position, which is probably the bottom left. If I move down, I might go out of bounds. Let me check the map again. The ""you"" block is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down from where I am. So I can move right twice and down twice to reach it. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 5 steps to the right and 4 up, but that's above me. The path to the ""you"" block seems clear. So I can move right twice and down twice to get to the ""you"" block. Once there, I can pick it up and maybe move it next to the ""is"" block to create a new rule.

But wait, the ""you"" block is part of the active rule ""baba is you."" If I move it, will that affect the rule? I'm not sure. Maybe I can create a new rule without breaking the existing one. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that adds to the existing one.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching the key would win the level. The key is 1 step to the right, so it's close. I just need to create that rule. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""win.""

But the ""key"" block is 10 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks closer. Let me see if I can move the ""is"" block down. The ""is"" block is 9 steps right and 4 up. If I can move it down, I can bring it closer to the key.

Wait, I can only move blocks that are not ""stop."" Since the ""is"" block isn't ""stop,"" I can move it. So I can move the ""is"" block down to a position where the ""key"" can be placed next to it. But moving the ""is"" block might disrupt other rules, so I need to be careful.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""win."" But the ""key"" is too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" block closer. The ""win"" block is 10 steps right and 4 up. If I can move it down, I can bring it closer to the key.

But moving the ""win"" block might not be straightforward. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to push walls or something. If I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can move the walls out of the way.

But I don't see a ""push"" block. Alternatively, I can make ""baba is push,"" which would let me push objects. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" The ball is 3 steps right and 3 up. If I can make the ball the win condition, I can just reach it. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ""ball"" block next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""ball"" block is 5 steps right and 2 up. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up, and ""win"" is next to it. So I need to move the ""ball"" block all the way to the right, which might not be feasible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to where the ""ball"" is. But that would require moving them left, which might be possible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block left to where the ""ball"" is. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it left 4 steps, it would be at 5 right and 4 up. Then, I can move the ""win"" block next to it. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea: since the key is close (1 step right), maybe I can make ""key is win"" by moving the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""win."" But the ""key"" is 10 right and 1 up, which is far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to the key's location.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" block to create a new rule. The ""you"" block is 2 right and 2 down. If I can move it next to ""is"" and another block, I can create a new rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is key."" That way, when I reach the key, it would count as winning. But I need to create that rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""baba."" The ""baba"" block is 1 left and 2 down. So I can move the ""key"" block to be next to ""is"" and ""baba."" But the ""key"" is far away, so that might not be easy.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block down to where the ""you"" block is. The ""you"" block is 2 right and 2 down. If I can move the ""is"" block there, I can create a new rule.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block down to where the ""you"" block is, and then move the ""you"" block next to it to create ""you is something."" But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""win"" block closer. The ""win"" block is 10 right and 4 up. If I can move it left, I can bring it closer to the key or ball.

But moving the ""win"" block might require moving the ""is"" block first. Let me try to move the ""is"" block down. If I can move it down, I can create space to move other blocks.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me try to move right to get closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 5 right and 4 up, which is where the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are. So I can't go through them.

Hmm, maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable. If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through them. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""wall is you,"" I need to move the ""you"" block next to ""is"" and ""wall."" The ""you"" block is 2 right and 2 down. The ""wall"" block is 1 left and 3 up. So I need to move the ""you"" block up and right to get it next to ""is"" and ""wall.""

But moving the ""you"" block might disrupt the active rule ""baba is you."" I'm not sure if that's allowed. Maybe I can create a new rule without affecting the existing one.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" block down to where the ""you"" block is. The ""wall"" block is 1 left and 3 up. If I can move it down, I can place it next to ""you"" and ""is.""

But I don't see an ""is"" block nearby. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block down to where the ""wall"" and ""you"" blocks are.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" block down, I can create a new rule. Let me try to move the ""is"" block down. But how? I need to be next to it to move it.

I'm currently at the starting position. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. I need to move right 9 times and up 4 times, but there are walls blocking the way. So I can't reach it directly.

Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can go through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" block.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is pass."" But I don't have a ""pass"" block either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is key."" Then, when I reach the key, it would count as winning. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""baba is key,"" I need to move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""baba."" The ""baba"" block is 1 left and 2 down. The ""key"" block is 10 right and 1 up. So I need to move the ""key"" block all the way left, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block to where the ""baba"" block is. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. If I can move it left 8 steps and down 2 steps, it would be next to ""baba."" But that's a lot of moves, and I'm not sure if it's possible.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can reach the key first. The key is 1 step to the right. If I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching it would end the level.

To create ""key is win,"" I need to move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" block is 10 right and 1 up. The ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are 9 right and 4 up, and 10 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""key"" block up 3 steps to reach the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

But moving the ""key"" block up might require moving it through walls, which I can't do unless I make walls passable. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks down to where the ""key"" is.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" block down, I can bring it closer to the ""key."" The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. If I move it down 3 steps, it would be at 9 right and 1 up, which is next to the ""key"" block. Then, I can move the ""win"" block next to it to create ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to be next to it to move it. Since it's 9 right and 4 up, and I'm at the starting position, I can't reach it without moving through walls. So I need to find a way to get past the walls.

Maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls passable. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't have a ""pass"" block. Alternatively, I can make ""baba is pass,"" but again, no ""pass"" block.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" block. The ""ball"" block is 5 right and 2 up. If I can make ""ball is pass,"" then I can use it to move through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" block.

Alternatively, I can make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. Then, I can use the ball to push walls or something. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to move the ""you"" block to create a new rule. The ""you"" block is 2 right and 2 down. If I can move it next to ""is"" and another block, I can create a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""you"" block next to ""is"" and ""key,"" I can create ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" block next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition something else. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block down to create space for other blocks. But I can't reach it because of the walls. Alternatively, I can try moving the ""win"" block closer.

Wait, the ""win"" block is 10 right and 4 up. If I can move it left, I can bring it closer to the key. But I need to be next to it to move it, which I can't because of the walls.

Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through them. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""wall is you,"" I need to move the ""you"" block next to ""is"" and ""wall."" The ""you"" block is 2 right and 2 down. The ""wall"" block is 1 left and 3 up. So I need to move the ""you"" block up and right to get it next to ""is"" and ""wall.""

But moving the ""you"" block might disrupt the active rule ""baba is you."" I'm not sure if that's allowed. Maybe I can create a new rule without affecting the existing one.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" block down to where the ""you"" block is. The ""wall"" block is 1 left and 3 up. If I can move it down, I can place it next to ""you"" and ""is.""

But I don't see an ""is"" block nearby. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block down to where the ""wall"" and ""you"" blocks are.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" block down, I can create a new rule. Let me try to move the ""is"" block down. But how? I need to be next to it to move it.

I'm currently at the starting position. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. I need to move right 9 times and up 4 times, but there are walls blocking the way. So I can't reach it directly.

Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can go through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" block.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is pass."" But I don't have a ""pass"" block either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is key."" Then, when I reach the key, it would count as winning. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""baba is key,"" I need to move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""baba."" The ""baba"" block is 1 left and 2 down. The ""key"" block is 10 right and 1 up. So I need to move the ""key"" block all the way left, which is not feasible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block to where the ""baba"" block is. The ""is"" block is 9 right and 4 up. If I can move it left 8 steps and down 2 steps, it would be next to ""baba."" But that's a lot of moves, and I'm not sure if it's possible.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can reach the key first. The key is 1 step to the right. If I can make ""key is win,"" then reaching it would end the level.

To create ""key is win,"" I need to move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" block is 10 right and 1 up. The ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are 9 right and 4 up, and 10 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""key"" block up 3 steps to reach the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

But moving the ""key"" block up might require moving it through walls, which","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. The ""ball"" is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball is important.

There are several walls and rules scattered around. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which probably makes walls immovable. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps up, so any wall objects are defined by that.

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change how Baba behaves or what counts as winning.

Since I'm controlling Baba, I need to move towards the key or the win condition. The key is closer, only 1 step to the right. Maybe I should pick up the key first. But how do I move? The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left.

Wait, in the previous steps, I was moving right and left, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let me think about the rules again. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that might help, but I don't know how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" But I'm not sure how to move rules around.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. It's only 1 step to the right. So, I'll choose the right action to move towards it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a key object 1 step to the left. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I see several walls and rules scattered around. The walls are immovable because they have the ""stop"" property. I can't move through them. The ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used somehow, but I'm not sure yet.

The rules are a bit complex. There are multiple ""is"" rules, which might allow me to create new rules by moving text blocks. For example, if I can move ""baba"" and ""you"" closer, I might change the active rule. But right now, ""baba is you"" is the only active rule.

I need to figure out how to get to the ""win"" rule. It's pretty far to the right and up. There are walls blocking the way, so I might need to break a rule or create a new one to move through them.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make a wall passable. Or perhaps I can create a new rule that changes the properties of walls.

I also notice a ""key"" rule 8 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a key object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock a door or something. But how do I get there?

Let me plan my movements. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move right and up to reach the ""win"" rule. But walls are in the way. Maybe I can move some rules to create a path.

If I move the ""is"" rule closer to ""baba,"" I might change the active rule. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" I could become the key and pick up the key object. That might help me unlock something.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into something else, maybe walls won't block me anymore. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" or ""ball"" to create a new rule that helps me progress. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up closer to ""ball"" or ""key.""

Wait, the ""ball"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make ""ball is you,"" I could control the ball and maybe push something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" might allow me to become the key. Let me try that. I'll move the ""is"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down to be next to ""key."" That would make ""key is you,"" allowing me to pick up the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or change a rule that allows me to reach the ""win"" condition. But I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" rule without getting stuck.

I think moving the ""is"" rule to the left and down is the way to go. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. The ""ball"" is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball is important.

There are several walls and rules scattered around. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change how walls behave. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps up, which might mean walls are stoppable or something.

I see multiple ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules. The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can rearrange these to change what Baba is.

The ""key"" is close, only 1 step to the right. Maybe I should pick that up first. But how? I need to move towards it. Let me plan my steps.

I'm currently at the starting position. To get the key, I need to move right once. But wait, are there any walls blocking me? The walls are 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up, so maybe not directly in my path. Let me try moving right.

After moving right, I pick up the key. Now, what's next? The win condition is far away, so maybe I need to create a new rule to make movement easier. Perhaps I can make Baba into a ball or something that can move through walls.

Looking at the ""ball"" rule, it's 6 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is ball."" That would let me move like a ball, maybe rolling through walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position. The ""is"" rule is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. I can move towards it. Let me plan the path: right, right, right, right, up, up. That should get me to the ""is"" rule.

Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to the ""ball"" rule. Then, the new rule ""baba is ball"" would take effect, allowing me to move as a ball. With this ability, I can roll through walls and reach the win condition more easily.

Alternatively, maybe I can make walls passable by changing their rule. The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, walls might not stop me anymore. But that might be more complicated.

I think the ball approach is better. Let me proceed with that plan. First, move right to get the key. Then, move towards the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is ball."" Once that's done, I can move freely towards the win.

Wait, but do I need the key for something else? Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or another rule. I'm not sure, but since it's close, I'll pick it up just in case.

So, my first action is to move right to get the key. Then, I'll work on creating the ""baba is ball"" rule to make progress towards the win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's probably the win condition. There's also a ""key"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a key object 1 step to the left. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something.

I see a ""ball"" object 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's also a ""rule ball"" 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, so that might block movement.

The ""wall"" rules are scattered around, and there are multiple walls. I need to be careful not to move into walls unless I can change the rules to make them passable.

I notice that there's a ""rule is"" 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is part of the win condition. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the win condition easier to reach.

I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. I need to figure out how to move towards the win. Let me plan my steps.

First, I should move towards the key since it's nearby. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left. But wait, I'm at the starting point, so moving left might not be possible if there's a wall. Let me check the map again.

The walls are 4 steps to the right and various steps up and down. I think I can move right first to get past any initial walls. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key and the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to reach the ""is"" rule and change some properties. If I can make Baba into something else, like a ball, I might be able to move through walls or other obstacles.

Wait, there's a ""rule ball"" 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is ball."" That would make me a ball, which can bounce or move differently.

So, my plan is to move towards the ""is"" rule and the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule. Let me start by moving right to get closer to those rules.

I think moving right is the best first step to access the necessary rules to change my properties.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" object is. From the list, I see ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is 8 steps right and 4 up from my starting position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can get there by moving through the map.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Keys are often used to unlock something, so maybe I need to pick that up. But to get the key, I need to move left. However, I should check if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are at 3 steps right and various up positions, so moving left might be possible.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, but I'm starting at the origin. So, moving left once would take me to the key. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking that path. The walls are at 3 steps right, so moving left from the start should be clear. So, I can move left to get the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps the key is needed to modify a rule. Let me look at the rules again.

There's a ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" So, the key rule is 8 right and 1 up. That's near the win condition. Maybe if I can move the key rule closer, I can change it to something useful.

But before that, I need to get the key. So, moving left once to pick it up seems like a good first step. After that, I can plan my next moves.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make Baba able to pass through walls, that would help. But the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can only move normally unless I change the rules.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `stop` 3 step up."" That might mean that the stop rule is 3 steps up, which could be preventing me from moving further. If I can move that rule, I might be able to remove the stop condition.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. So, moving left to get the key seems like the immediate action.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving into a wall. Let me check the walls again. The walls are at 3 steps right and various up positions, so moving left from the start shouldn't hit a wall. So, it's safe to move left.

After getting the key, I can then think about how to use it. Maybe I can combine it with another rule to change the win condition or make movement easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The win rule is 8 right and 4 up, which is quite far. If I can move it closer, I can reach it more easily.

But to move rules, I need to have the necessary components. For example, to change ""baba is you"" to something else, I need to move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 up. That's near the win rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to make changes.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should first get the key and see what options it opens up.

So, in summary, my plan is:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to modify a rule, possibly the win condition or to allow moving through walls.
3. Proceed towards the win condition.

But since I can only choose one action right now, the immediate step is to move left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The rules are spread out, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" The ball is two steps to the right and three steps up. The key is nine steps to the right and one step up. There's also a ""key"" object one step to the left.

Hmm, I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks to change the rules. So maybe I can manipulate these rules to make the key or ball do something useful. The key is positioned far to the right, so maybe I need to get there somehow.

Wait, the ball is closer. Maybe I can make the ball into something that can help me reach the key or the win condition. If I can make the ball ""you,"" then I can control it. But how?

Looking at the rules, there's a ""ball"" rule five steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move that rule next to the ball, maybe I can change the ball's properties. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""ball is you.""

But first, I need to get to where the rules are. The ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and four steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move towards it step by step.

Wait, the key is nine steps to the right and one step up. If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks something. But I don't see a lock, so maybe the key is part of a rule that I need to create.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a ""win"" condition. If I can create a rule like ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level. But I need to move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position.

The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and four steps up. That's the same column as the key. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to the ball's position. But how?

I think the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that can help me. Let me try moving right to get closer to the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right and three steps up. If I move into that, I might get stuck. I need to avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get around the walls. Let me check the layout again. There are walls four steps to the right and various steps up and down. I need to navigate around them.

I think the safest path is to move right step by step, avoiding the ""stop"" rule. Once I'm near the ""is"" rule, I can start creating new rules to help me progress.

So, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the rules and the ball. That should help me set up the necessary rules to win the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the left, which might be useful. The ""ball"" is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. There are several walls and other rules scattered around.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which could be used to create new rules by moving them around. For example, if I can move a ""ball"" rule next to an ""is"" rule, I might be able to make a new rule like ""ball is something."" That could change the properties of the ball or other objects.

The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, which probably means that any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved. I need to be careful not to get stuck by moving into a ""stop"" object.

The ""key"" is 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something. But how? Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to see if I can reach the key without hitting any walls or stop rules.

Let me plan my path. I'm currently at the starting position. To get to the key, I need to move left once. But I have to check if there's a wall or a stop rule in that direction. The observation says there's a ""rule `stop` 3 step up,"" so moving left might be okay as long as there's no stop rule in that direction.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is 3 steps up, which is above me, not to the left. So moving left once should be possible. Let me try that.

After moving left, I can pick up the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open a door or change a rule. But I don't see a door mentioned, so perhaps the key is needed to modify a rule.

Looking back at the rules, there's a ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" That's far away, but maybe if I can move the key rule closer, I can create a new rule involving the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" to make ""key is something."" That could change the key's properties, making it possible to use it in a different way.

I also see a ""ball"" rule 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make the ball into something else, like a win condition, that might help me reach the win faster.

But first, I need to get the key. So, moving left once seems like the first step. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to make progress.

First, I should identify what's movable. The walls are probably ""STOP"" by default, so I can't move through them. The ball and key might be movable if they're not defined as ""STOP."" The rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" and ""key"" are text blocks that can be moved to create or change rules.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I can use that to unlock something. But to get to the key, I need to move left. However, I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably near the bottom. Let me visualize the map.

The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path. There are multiple walls at 4 steps to the right and various steps up. The ""win"" rule is way to the right and up, so I might need to create a path or change some rules to reach it.

I see a ""ball"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make the ball moveable, maybe I can use it to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how yet.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to make walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to change the ""win"" condition to something easier.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I move that, I could change what Baba is. Maybe I can make Baba into a different object, like a key or a ball, which might help me move through the level more effectively.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the key first. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left. But I'm currently at the starting position, so moving left might take me towards the key. However, I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up, but I'm trying to move left, so maybe that's not an issue. There's also a wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but again, moving left might avoid that.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I move that, I can make the walls passable. But how? Maybe if I move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls won't stop me anymore.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by moving a ""is"" block next to another object. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key,"" I could create ""key is you,"" making the key controllable. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea: if I can make the ball into a ""WIN"" object, then reaching the ball would win the level. But I need to see if that's possible.

Let me outline possible actions:

1. Move left to reach the key. But I need to check if the path is clear.
2. Move up to see if I can access other rules or objects.
3. Move right to get closer to the ""win"" rule, but that seems too far.
4. Move down, but I'm already at the bottom, so that's not helpful.

I think the best initial move is to move left towards the key. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can unlock a path or change a rule that helps me reach the win condition.

So, I'll choose to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to change the game's rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So the win condition is 10 steps right and 4 up from my current position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can create a shortcut by changing the rules.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Keys usually unlock something, so maybe I need to pick that up. But to get the key, I might need to move through some walls or change the rules to make the walls passable.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up."" If I can move this rule, I might be able to make some walls stop me or not. Also, there's a ""rule `ball` 6 steps to the right and 2 step up."" Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change the rules.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but walls are in the way. If I can make the walls not stop me, I can reach the win.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key first. It's 1 step to the right. But to get there, I might need to move through some walls. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls not stop me.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, maybe the walls won't block me anymore. Or perhaps I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" to make walls movable.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another property, I can change the wall's behavior. For example, making ""wall is you"" would let me move through walls, but that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, I can try to reach the ""key"" first, then use it to unlock something. But I'm not sure what the key does yet. Maybe it's needed to change a rule.

Let me try to move towards the key. It's 1 step to the right. But there's a wall in the way. Hmm. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the wall not stop me. Or perhaps I can move the wall itself.

Wait, the wall is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that wall, I can create a path. But how? I need to manipulate the rules to make walls movable.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to a different position so that the walls don't block me. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule that's 2 steps to the right and 3 up. If I can move it somewhere else, the walls might become passable.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving an ""is"" rule next to a wall and another property. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""push"" to make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls.

But I'm not sure where the ""push"" rule is. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and another object.

Wait, I see a ""rule `ball`"" at 6 steps right and 2 up. Maybe I can use the ball to help. If I can make the ball push walls, that could help clear a path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer to me. It's 10 steps right and 4 up. That's too far. Maybe I can change the win condition to something else, like reaching the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to another object to redefine the win condition.

Another idea: since I'm Baba, I can move around, but walls are blocking me. If I can make myself into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to move through walls. But I don't see a ""ball is you"" rule yet.

Wait, there's a ""rule `ball`"" at 6 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can create ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. Then, maybe the ball can push walls.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on making the walls passable.

Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. It's at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I can move it to a different position, the walls might not stop me. For example, moving it to a place where it doesn't affect the walls I need to pass.

Alternatively, I can try to break the ""stop"" rule by moving it away from the walls. That way, the walls won't have the stop property anymore.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location where it's not affecting the walls.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it's not near any walls, so the walls lose their stop property. That would allow me to move through them.

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule that's currently at 2 steps right and 3 up to a different location, away from the walls. That should make the walls passable.

To do that, I need to move towards the ""stop"" rule. It's 2 steps right and 3 up from my current position. So, I should move right twice and up three times to reach it.

Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else. Maybe to a place where it doesn't affect the walls I need to pass.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it's not near any walls, so the walls lose their stop property.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe there's a better way to manipulate the rules.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the walls into something else, like ""wall is push,"" I can push them out of the way. To do that, I need to move an ""is"" rule next to a wall and a ""push"" rule.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule on the map. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another object to define ""push.""

Alternatively, I can use the ball to push walls if I can make the ball push them.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule first.

So, to summarize, I think the best course of action is to move towards the ""stop"" rule, pick it up, and move it to a different location so that the walls become passable. That way, I can reach the key and potentially change the win condition or find another way to win.

Alternatively, if moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't work, I can try to create a new rule that makes walls passable.

But for now, I'll try moving the ""stop"" rule. So, I need to move right twice and up three times to reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else.

Wait, but in the observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up. So, from my current position, I need to move right twice and up three times to get there.

But I'm not sure if that's the exact path. Maybe there are walls blocking me. If I can't reach the ""stop"" rule because of walls, I need another approach.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another property to change the wall's behavior.

For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to a wall and a ""push"" rule, I can make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push them.

But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another object.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. If I can make the ball push walls, I can use it to clear a path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and a ""push"" rule, but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a different object that can push walls.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: since the win condition is 10 steps right and 4 up, which is far, maybe I can change the win condition to something closer, like reaching the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 4 up, and the key is at 1 step right. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the key's position.

But that's a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by manipulating other rules.

Alternatively, I can try to make the key into the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule next to it.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the key's position, making ""key is win.""

That way, when I pick up the key, I win.

But I need to move the ""win"" rule to the key's position. The key is 1 step to the right, so I need to move the ""win"" rule from 10 right and 4 up to 1 right.

That's a big move, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the key and ""win,"" making ""key is win.""

That would change the win condition to picking up the key.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on making the walls passable first.

Wait, another idea: if I can make myself into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to move through walls. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""ball is you.""

The ""ball"" rule is at 6 steps right and 2 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and ""you,"" I can make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball.

Then, maybe the ball can push walls or move through them.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe I can just manipulate the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to a different position to change my properties.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps down. If I can move it next to another property, I can change what Baba is.

For example, moving it next to ""push"" would make ""baba is push,"" allowing me to push objects.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it.

Alternatively, I can try to make Baba into something else, like a key or a wall, but that might not help.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think the best approach is to try to make the walls passable by moving the ""stop"" rule away from them.

So, I'll try to move towards the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 up. Let's see if I can reach it.

From my current position, I need to move right twice and up three times. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path.

Looking at the objects, there are walls at various positions, including 5 steps right and 4 up, which is where I'm starting. So, moving right twice would take me to 7 steps right, but I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right and 4 up, 5 right and 3 up, etc. So, moving right from 5 right, I might hit walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls.

Wait, I'm at 5 right and 4 up. If I move up, I might go out of bounds, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving right first.

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and ""not stop,"" I can make walls not stop me. But I don't see a ""not stop"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to break the ""stop"" rule by moving it away from the walls.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it's not affecting any walls. That way, the walls lose their stop property.

So, I'll try to move the ""stop"" rule that's at 2 steps right and 3 up to a different location, like 5 steps right and 1 down, which is a wall position. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Alternatively, I can move it to a place where it's not near any walls, so the walls become passable.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move it to the left or down.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I move it to the left, away from the walls, that might work.

So, I'll try to move left from the ""stop"" rule's position. But I'm not sure how to get there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it's not affecting the walls I need to pass.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first.

The key is 1 step to the right. If I can move right once, I can pick it up. But there's a wall in the way.

Wait, the wall is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So, moving right from 5 right would take me to 6 right, but I need to go to 5 right and 1 up.

Hmm, maybe I can move up first to go around the wall.

Alternatively, I can try to move the wall to make a path.

But I don't know how to do that yet. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make walls movable.

Wait, if I can make walls into something else, like ""wall is push,"" I can push them out of the way.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another object.

Alternatively, I can try to make the walls into ""not stop"" by moving the ""stop"" rule away.

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls. So, I'll try to move towards it and then move it to a different location.

So, my plan is:

1. Move towards the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 up.
2. Once there, pick up the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move it to a position where it's not affecting any walls, like 5 steps right and 1 down.
4. With the ""stop"" rule moved, the walls should no longer stop me.
5. Then, I can move towards the key and pick it up.
6. Finally, I can use the key to change the win condition or proceed to the win object.

But I'm not sure if this will work. Maybe I need to try a different strategy.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another property to make walls passable.

For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and ""push"" to make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push them.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to a wall and another object.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. If I can make the ball push walls, I can use it to clear a path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, I can try to make the ball into a different object that can push walls.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule first.

So, I'll try to move towards the ""stop"" rule. It's 2 steps right and 3 up from my current position.

From 5 right and 4 up, moving right twice would take me to 7 right, but I need to go to 2 right and 3 up, which is relative to my current position.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinates. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up from my current position, which is 5 right and 4 up.

So, moving right twice would take me to 7 right, and up three times would take me to 7 up. But that might be out of bounds.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are absolute, so the ""stop"" rule is at position (2,3), and I'm at (5,4). So, I need to move left 3 steps and down 1 step to reach it.

But that might not be possible due to walls.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative, and I need to move right twice and up three times from my current position.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving right twice and up three times and see if I can reach the ""stop"" rule.

So, I'll try to move right twice and up three times. Let's see if that works.

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer to me, I can reach it without going all the way to 10 right and 4 up.

The ""win"" rule is at 10 right and 4 up. If I can move it to a closer position, like 5 right and 4 up, which is where I am, then I can win immediately.

But how can I move the ""win"" rule? I need to pick it up and move it.

But to pick it up, I need to reach it, which is 10 right and 4 up","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I need to figure out where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So the win condition is 10 steps right and 4 up from my current position. That's pretty far, but maybe I can get there by manipulating the rules.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Keys are often used to unlock something, so maybe I need to pick that up. But to get the key, I need to move right once. However, I should check if there are any walls or stop rules in the way.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 5 steps to the right and 4 up, which is where the win condition is. That might block me unless I can move it. There's also a ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up,"" which could prevent me from moving further if I don't handle it.

I see a ""ball"" 3 steps to the right and 3 up. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the key or the win condition.

The rules are spread out, and I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can change the properties of that object. Maybe I can make the ball into something else or change the win condition.

I also notice that there's a ""rule `baba` 2 steps down"" and ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" This might mean that if I move these rules, I can change what Baba is or what ""you"" represents, which could be useful.

Since I'm currently at the starting position, I think the first step is to move right to get closer to the key and the win condition. But I need to make sure there are no walls or stop rules blocking my path. If there's a wall in the way, I might need to move it by manipulating the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or bypass the stop rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but if I can change that, I might be able to move through them.

Wait, the ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" is in my path. If I move right, I might hit this stop rule, which would prevent me from moving further. So I need to handle that first. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else or change it into something else.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `is` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up,"" which is near the win condition. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""stop is something,"" which might deactivate the stop effect.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule next to another object to change its property. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" it would make walls stop movement, but if I move it next to something else, it might have a different effect.

I think the best approach is to first move right to get closer to the key and the win condition, but I need to make sure I can bypass the stop rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down or somewhere else to deactivate it.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule to create a new rule that changes the stop's effect. For example, if I make ""stop is push,"" then I can push through the stop rule.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first. Let me see where I can move it. There's a ""rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" so if I move the ""stop"" rule next to that, I can create ""stop is something.""

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving right first and see what happens. If I move right, I might hit the stop rule, which would prevent me from moving further. So I need to handle that first.

I think the best course of action is to move the ""stop"" rule down or to the side so it's not in my path. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule down two steps. That way, it's no longer blocking my path to the right.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it by taking steps in the direction of the rule's position. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 3 up. So I need to move right twice and up three times to reach it, but that's a bit far. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use another rule to help me.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop,"" I can make ""stop is something,"" which might change its effect.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 up, which is near the win condition. Maybe I can move it closer. But that's also far.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving right first and see if I can get past the stop rule. If I move right once, I might hit the stop rule, but if I can manipulate it before moving, that would be better.

I think I need to prioritize moving the ""stop"" rule out of the way. Let me try to move it down two steps so it's no longer blocking my path. That way, I can move right freely.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down by taking steps in that direction. Let me try moving down twice to reach it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps right and 3 up. So to reach it, I need to move right twice and up three times. That's a bit of a detour, but maybe necessary.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that allows me to move through the stop rule. For example, if I can make ""stop is push,"" then I can push through it.

But I'm not sure how to create that rule. I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and another word to make ""stop is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule nearby.

Maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the ball into a pusher, I can use it to push the stop rule out of the way.

Wait, the ball is 3 steps right and 3 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can make ""ball is push."" Then, I can use the ball to push the stop rule.

That sounds like a plan. Let me try that.

First, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball. The ""is"" rule is 9 steps right and 4 up, which is far. Maybe I can move it closer.

Alternatively, I can move the ball to where the ""is"" rule is. But that's also far.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can reach the key first. The key is 1 step to the right. If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks something.

But to get the key, I need to move right once. However, the stop rule is 2 steps right and 3 up, which might block me. So I need to handle that first.

I think the best course of action is to move the ""stop"" rule out of the way. Let me try moving it down two steps so it's no longer blocking my path.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""stop"" rule by taking steps in that direction. Let me try moving down twice to reach it.

Wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try moving right first and see what happens.

If I move right once, I might hit the stop rule, which would prevent me from moving further. So I need to handle that first.

I think I need to move the ""stop"" rule down two steps. Let me try that.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule by taking steps in the direction of its position. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps right and 3 up, so I need to move right twice and up three times to reach it.

That's a bit of a detour, but necessary. Let me try that.

First, I'll move right twice to get to the same column as the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move up three times to reach it. Once I'm there, I can move it down two steps to clear the path.

After that, I can move right to get the key and proceed towards the win condition.

So, my first action should be to move right to start reaching the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Maybe that's important.

I see several ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 4 up, and another at 3 steps right and 2 up. These could be used to create new rules by moving them next to other objects.

The ""ball"" is at 2 steps right and 3 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break something or create a new rule. There's also a ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up, which might prevent movement if not handled correctly.

I need to figure out how to get to the ""win"" rule. Since it's so far to the right, I might need to create a path or change some rules to make movement easier. Maybe I can make Baba able to jump or something by rearranging the rules.

Wait, there's a ""key"" nearby. If I can pick up the key, maybe it can unlock something. But how? I need to see if there's a ""key is unlock"" rule or something similar. I don't see that yet, but maybe I can create it by moving the ""key"" rule next to ""unlock.""

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is passable,"" that would help. To do that, I'd need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""passable."" But I don't see a ""passable"" rule here. Hmm.

Another idea: maybe I can make the ball into a tool. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it to break walls or reach higher places. Let me check if there's a ""push"" rule. I don't see one, but perhaps I can create it by combining existing rules.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can stack them to create a chain of rules. For example, ""baba is you"" and ""you is win"" would make Baba the winner. But I don't see a ""you is win"" rule. Wait, the ""win"" rule is separate. Maybe I can move ""you"" next to ""win"" to make ""you is win,"" which would mean Baba is win.

Let me plan the steps. First, I need to get closer to the ""win"" rule. I'm currently at the starting position. I see walls blocking the way, but maybe I can go around. Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls.

Looking at the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 up. That's in the way. If I can make walls passable, I can go through. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""wall is passable."" I have a ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 3 up. If I can move that next to ""passable,"" but I don't see a ""passable"" rule. Maybe I can create it by combining other rules.

Alternatively, I can try to break the wall. There's a ""ball"" nearby. If I can make the ball push the wall, maybe I can clear a path. To do that, I need ""ball is push."" I can create that by moving the ""ball"" rule next to ""push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by combining ""is"" and ""push.""

Wait, I have a ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can make ""stop is passable,"" then maybe I can move through it. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Another idea: since the ""win"" rule is so far to the right, maybe I can create a rule that makes moving right easier. For example, ""right is win"" or something that allows me to win by moving right. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer to me. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to me, then I can just step on it to win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule, which is at 9 steps right and 4 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can create a path by moving other rules out of the way.

Wait, I have a ""key"" at 1 step right. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something. If I can make ""key is unlock,"" then I can unlock the win condition. But I don't see an ""unlock"" rule. Maybe I can create it by combining ""key"" and ""unlock.""

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I need to get to the ""win"" rule. The walls are in the way. Maybe I can create a rule that allows me to jump over the walls. For example, ""baba is jump."" But I don't see a ""jump"" rule. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is passable.""

To make ""wall is passable,"" I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""passable."" But I don't see a ""passable"" rule. Maybe I can create it by combining ""is"" and ""passable."" Wait, I have multiple ""is"" rules. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to ""passable,"" that would create the rule.

But where is ""passable""? I don't see it listed. Maybe I need to create it from existing rules. For example, if I have ""is"" and ""passable,"" I can make ""is passable."" But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win."" If I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""win,"" then since ""baba is you,"" that would make ""baba is win."" Let me check the positions. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 up. That's a long way apart. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer.

Wait, I can move the ""you"" rule by pushing it with the ball or something. But I need to get to the ball first. The ball is at 2 steps right and 3 up. I can move towards it.

Let me plan the path. From my current position, I can move right twice to get to the ball. Then, I can use the ball to push the ""you"" rule towards the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure the path is clear.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that allows me to win by being near the key. The key is at 1 step right. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" But the ""win"" rule is far away.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to create a rule that allows me to move through walls. Let me see if I can find a way to do that. I have a ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 3 up. If I can move that next to ""passable,"" but I don't see ""passable."" Maybe I can create it by combining ""is"" and ""passable.""

Wait, I have a ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can make ""stop is passable,"" then I can move through it. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So, the win condition is 9 steps right and 4 up from my current position. That's pretty far, so I need to figure out how to get there.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the right. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 10 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which might mean that the key has some property defined by that rule. I'm not sure yet, but it's something to consider.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 up. I wonder if the ball is part of the win condition or if it's just an obstacle. There's also a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" so the ball's properties are defined there.

I see several ""rule `is`"" blocks, which are essential because they define the rules. For example, ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 4 step up"" is part of the ""WIN"" rule. Maybe I can move these to create new rules or modify existing ones.

Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move around. I need to plan a path to the win condition, but walls might block me. Let me check the walls' positions. There are walls at 4 steps right and 4 up, which is where the ""WIN"" rule is. So, the win condition is behind a wall? That complicates things.

Wait, the wall is at 4 right and 4 up, but the win rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So, maybe the wall is somewhere else. Let me recount: the walls are at various positions, but the win rule is at 9 right and 4 up, which is far to the right. I need to get past any walls in my way.

I also see a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" That might mean that if I move into that position, I stop. I should avoid that unless I need to.

The key is 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to pick it up. If I move right once, I can get the key. But I need to see what the key does. The ""rule `key` 10 right and 1 up"" might define the key's property. If I can move that rule, I could change what the key does.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to another word. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can change the win condition.

But first, I need to get to the key. Let me try moving right once to pick up the key. That would be the ""right"" action.

Wait, but if I move right, I might be moving into a wall or another object. Let me check the objects around me. The key is 1 step to the right, so I can move there. But I should also check if there's a wall in that position. From the observation, the walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so moving right once shouldn't hit a wall immediately.

So, my plan is to move right to get the key. Once I have the key, I can see if it helps me reach the win condition or change rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up or down to rearrange rules. For example, moving an ""is"" block next to ""win"" could change the win condition to something else, making it easier to reach.

But since I'm just starting, getting the key seems like a good first step. So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something? But I'm not sure yet.

I see several walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are placed in various positions, some with ""stop"" rules, which probably make them immovable. There are also ""is"" rules and ""ball"" rules, which might be used to create new rules or modify existing ones.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't pass through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move some ""is"" or ""ball"" rules to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or change my properties.

Let me think about the key. It's only one step to the left. If I can get to it, maybe I can use it to unlock the win condition or modify another rule. But to get the key, I need to move left, but I'm currently at the starting position. Wait, where exactly am I? The observation doesn't specify my current position, so I might need to infer based on the objects' positions.

Looking at the ""baba"" rule, it's 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. That might mean I'm near that area. If I move left twice and down twice, I can reach the ""baba"" rule. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the ""win"" rule. It's 8 steps right and 4 up. That's a long way. Are there any obstacles in the way? There are walls at 4 steps right and various up positions, so I might need to find a path around them or change the rules to make the walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step right and 3 up. That probably makes the wall at that position immovable. So I can't just break through it. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule elsewhere or replace it with something else.

I also notice a ""ball"" object 2 steps right and 3 up. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls. Maybe I can move the ball to hit a wall or a rule.

Another idea: if I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching myself, but I'm not sure if that's possible here. Alternatively, I could try to make the key into something else, like ""key is win,"" so that picking up the key would win the level.

Let me outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the key to the left. But I need to check if the path is clear. If I move left once, I might reach the key. But I'm not sure if there are walls blocking me.

2. Alternatively, move up to reach the ""is"" rules and try to create a new rule that helps me bypass walls or change my properties.

3. Maybe move the ""ball"" to a position where it can break a wall or trigger a rule change.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can pick up and move text blocks. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" could create ""win is something,"" but I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, moving ""is"" next to ""key"" could make ""key is something,"" which might change its properties.

I think the key is close, so maybe I should try to get it first. Let me try moving left once to see if I can pick up the key.

But wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so if I move left, I might be able to grab it. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 up, but that's not directly in my way if I'm moving left. So maybe moving left is safe.

If I move left, I can pick up the key. Then, perhaps I can use the key to unlock the win condition or modify a rule.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the key directly, I might need to change the rules to make the walls passable or to move the key closer.

Another approach: since the win rule is far away, maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition, like the key. That way, I can win by picking up the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""STOP."" So I need to find movable ""is"" rules and move them next to the key and win.

Looking at the ""is"" rules, there are several. One is 7 steps right and 4 up, another is 4 steps right and 2 up, and another is 1 step left and 2 down. Maybe I can move one of these to create the desired rule.

If I move the ""is"" rule that's 4 steps right and 2 up next to the key, which is 1 step left, I can create ""key is something."" But I need to make it ""key is win.""

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps right and 4 up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the key and the win rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule closer to me by moving its ""is"" rule. But that might be complicated.

Another idea: since I'm Baba, I can move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving into it.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's easier to just move towards the key.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so if I move left once, I can pick it up. Let me try that.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking me. The walls are mostly to the right and up, so moving left might be clear.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left once to pick up the key.

2. Once I have the key, see if I can use it to unlock the win condition or modify a rule.

Alternatively, if moving left is blocked, I might need to find another way.

But since the key is only 1 step left, I think it's worth trying.

So, I'll choose the ""left"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I need the key to unlock something? 

I notice there are several walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are placed in various positions, some with ""stop"" rules, which probably make them immovable. There's a ""ball"" object 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used somehow, maybe to break through walls or change rules.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. I need to see if I can rearrange any rules to make progress. For example, if I can move the ""key"" next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the new win condition. That could simplify things.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to knock down some walls. If I can move the ball next to a wall and create a rule like ""ball is break,"" then the ball could break the wall, creating a path. But I don't see a ""break"" rule here, so that might not work.

Another idea is to change the win condition. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""win,"" making ""you is win,"" then reaching myself would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

I should also consider the positions of the rules. The ""is"" rule is in multiple places, which is good because I can use it to create new rules. The ""stop"" rule is near some walls, so those walls are probably immovable. The ""wall"" rule is also present, so maybe I can create more walls or change existing ones.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get closer to the key or the win. Since the key is closer (9 steps right and 1 up), maybe I should aim for that first. To get there, I need to move right several times. But I have to avoid the walls. Let me check the path: moving right 4 steps and up 4 steps would take me near the walls, but maybe I can navigate around.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and various up positions. So moving right 4 steps would hit a wall. Maybe I should move up first to bypass them. Let me try moving up a few steps to create space.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule closer by rearranging it. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I can create ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to it. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up, which is near the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""key"" rule to that area, I can create a new rule.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. That's a bit far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""key"" is. But moving rules requires moving the ""is"" block next to the subject.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to create a new Baba, but that might complicate things.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right a few steps to get closer. Each move right brings me closer to the key. Once I'm near the key, I can try to create a new rule involving it.

So, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the key. Each ""right"" action brings me one step closer. I'll need to move right multiple times, but I have to be careful not to hit any walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and various up positions. So moving right 4 steps would take me to the wall. Maybe I should move up first to go over them. Let me try moving up a few steps to create space.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls movable. If I can change a wall's property from ""stop"" to something else, I can pass through. But I don't see a way to do that immediately.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving right as much as possible without hitting walls. Let me see: moving right 4 steps would hit a wall, so I can move right 3 steps to avoid it. Then, I can move up to navigate around.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, so moving right 3 and up 1 would take me to a position where I can move further right without hitting the wall. Let me try that.

So, I'll move right 3 times, then up once. Now, I'm at 3 right and 1 up. From here, I can move right again to 4 right, but that's a wall. So I need to move up more.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first. Let me try moving up 4 steps first. That would take me to 0 right and 4 up. From there, I can move right towards the key.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So if I'm at 0 right and 4 up, I can move right 9 times to reach it. But that's a long way, and there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 2 right and 3 up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push the ball to break walls. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on reaching the key first. Let me try moving right as much as possible without hitting walls. I'll move right 3 times, then up once to avoid the wall. Now, I'm at 3 right and 1 up. From here, I can move right again to 4 right, but that's a wall. So I need to move up more.

I'll move up another step to 3 up. Now, I'm at 3 right and 2 up. From here, I can move right to 4 right, which is a wall. So I need to move up again to 3 up. Now, I'm at 3 right and 3 up. From here, I can move right to 4 right, which is a wall. Hmm, stuck again.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for any movable rules. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. If I can move that closer, I can create new rules. But moving the ""is"" rule requires moving it next to another rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. If I can move that next to ""win,"" I can make ""you is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But that's a bit far.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. I'm currently at 3 right and 3 up. To get to the ""you"" rule, I need to move left 2 steps and down 5 steps. That's a lot, and I might hit walls on the way.

Maybe it's better to focus on the key. Let me try moving right 5 times. That would take me to 5 right, but I have to check if there are walls there. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so 5 right might be clear. Let me try moving right 5 times.

After moving right 5 times, I'm at 5 right and 0 up. Now, I can move up to reach the key. The key is at 9 right and 1 up, so I need to move right 4 more times and up once. But moving right 4 from 5 right would take me to 9 right, which is where the key is. Wait, no, the key is at 9 right and 1 up. So I need to move up once after reaching 9 right.

But moving right 4 from 5 right would take me to 9 right, but I have to check if there are walls in between. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so moving right beyond 4 should be okay as long as I'm not hitting walls in that column.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, etc. So moving right beyond 4 is possible as long as I'm not in those specific up positions. Since I'm moving along 0 up, I should be fine.

So, I'll move right 4 more times to reach 9 right. Now, I'm at 9 right and 0 up. From here, I can move up once to reach the key at 9 right and 1 up. But wait, the key is at 9 right and 1 up, so moving up once from 9 right and 0 up would take me there.

But I need to check if there's a wall at 9 right and 1 up. Looking back at the objects, there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up, but not at 9 right and 1 up. So it's clear.

Once I'm at 9 right and 1 up, I can interact with the key. But how? I need to create a rule involving the key. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is something.""

The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. To move it next to the key, I need to move it down 3 steps and right 1 step. But moving rules requires moving the ""is"" block next to the subject.

Wait, I'm at 9 right and 1 up with the key. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. To bring the ""is"" rule down to 1 up, I need to move it down 3 steps. But can I do that? I control Baba, so I can move the ""is"" rule if it's movable.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is a rule block, which is usually movable unless defined otherwise. So I can move it. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule down 3 steps to 8 right and 1 up. Now, it's next to the key at 9 right and 1 up.

Wait, no, moving the ""is"" rule from 8 right and 4 up down 3 steps would take it to 8 right and 1 up. Then, I can move it right 1 step to 9 right and 1 up, where the key is. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the key, so I can create a new rule: ""key is [something].""

What should I make the key be? Maybe ""key is win,"" so that collecting the key wins the level. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. So I need to move it down 3 steps to 9 right and 1 up, where the ""is"" rule and key are.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires moving it next to the ""is"" rule. So I can move the ""win"" rule down 3 steps to 9 right and 1 up. Now, the ""win"" rule is next to the ""is"" rule and the key. So the new rule becomes ""key is win.""

Now, the win condition is the key. So I just need to collect the key. But wait, I'm already at the key's position. So does that mean I've won? Or do I need to move onto the key?

I think moving onto the key would trigger the win condition now that ""key is win."" So I can move onto the key, and that should complete the level.

But let me double-check. The active rules are ""baba is you"" and now ""key is win."" So when I step on the key, it should count as winning. Yes, that makes sense.

So, to recap, I moved right 5 times to get to 5 right, then right 4 more times to 9 right, moved up once to reach the key. Then, I moved the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule to create ""key is win."" Now, stepping on the key should win the level.

I think that's the solution. Let me try it step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I notice that the key is only one step to the left. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something. The ball is two steps to the right and three steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to break walls or change rules. 

The rules like ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" are positioned far to the right and up. Maybe I can move those to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I might change what counts as winning. 

I also see that there's a ""rule `stop`"" which is two steps to the right and three steps up. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make some objects stop moving or become passable. 

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to avoid the walls unless I can change their properties. Maybe I can move a ""wall"" rule to turn a wall into something else, like a passable object. 

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get closer to the key. It's only one step to the left, so maybe I can move left. But I have to check if there's a wall blocking me. The observation says there's a wall three steps to the right and one step down, but I'm not sure about my current position. 

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so if I move left, I can pick it up. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall. Let me check the walls around me. There's a wall three steps to the right and four steps up, but that's not directly in my path if I move left. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to get closer to the ball or the rules. The ball is two steps to the right and three steps up. If I can get the ball, maybe I can use it to break through walls or change rules. 

But I'm not sure how the ball works. In Baba Is You, sometimes objects can be used to push or break things. Maybe if I can move the ball into a wall, it will break it. 

Another idea: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I might redefine what wins the level. For example, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. That could be a shortcut. 

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule text block. It's currently nine steps to the right and four steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move towards it step by step. 

But before that, I should check if there are any immediate threats or opportunities. The key is close, only one step left. Maybe I should prioritize getting the key. 

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving into a wall. Let me check the walls again. There's a wall three steps to the right and four steps up, but that's not directly in my path. The walls are more to the right and up, so moving left might be safe. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to get closer to the ball and the rules. The ball is two steps right and three up, and the rules are further up. 

I'm a bit confused about the exact layout. Maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can access the ball or the rules. 

If I move up, I can get closer to the ball, which might help me in breaking walls or changing rules. Once I have the ball, I can use it to push or break things. 

Alternatively, moving right might help me access the rules like ""is"" and ""win."" But moving right could also take me into walls. 

I think the best first step is to move left to get the key, as it's the closest and might be essential for unlocking something. 

Wait, but if I move left, I might be moving into a wall. Let me check the walls again. The walls are positioned at various steps, but I don't see a wall directly to my left. So moving left should be safe. 

So, I'll choose to move left to pick up the key. That might give me an advantage in solving the level.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, I see ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 4 step up."" So the win condition is 9 steps right and 4 up from my current position. That's quite far, so I need to figure out how to get there.

I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up,"" which might mean that the key has some property defined by that rule. I'm not sure yet, but it's something to consider.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 up. I wonder if the ball can be used to change rules or move something else. There's also a ""rule `ball` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up,"" so maybe the ball has some special property.

I see several ""rule `is`"" blocks, which are essential for creating new rules. If I can move these around, I might be able to redefine what Baba is or change the win condition.

The walls are everywhere, so I need to find a path that avoids them or uses them to my advantage. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" suggests that walls have some property defined by that rule. Maybe if I change that rule, walls can become passable or something else.

I also notice that there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If I can modify this rule, perhaps I can make certain objects stop moving or allow me to pass through them.

My initial thought is to move towards the key since it's close. If I can pick up the key, maybe it will help me unlock a path or change a rule. So, I should move left to get the key.

After getting the key, I can look for a way to use it. Maybe I can combine it with a rule to change the win condition or make the walls passable. Alternatively, I could use the key to move a rule block and create a new rule that helps me reach the win.

Another option is to move towards the ball. If I can manipulate the ball's rule, perhaps it can help me move other objects or create a path. But since the ball is a bit further, I might want to handle the key first.

I should also consider the ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down."" If I can move this rule, I might redefine what Baba is, which could give me new abilities or change how I interact with the environment.

In summary, my plan is to move left to pick up the key, then use it in combination with other rule blocks to either change the win condition, make walls passable, or redefine my own properties. Once I have the key, I can explore more options to reach the win.

So, the first step is to move left to get the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 10 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. I also notice a key that's 1 step to the right. Maybe I need the key to unlock something.

The rules on the map include ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you."" I can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

I see a ball at 3 steps right and 3 up. There's also a rule ""ball"" at 6 right and 2 up. Maybe if I move the ""ball"" rule next to the ball, I can change its properties. But I'm not sure how that helps me reach the win.

The key is at 1 step to the right. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or something. But I don't see a door on the map. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can combine them to create new rules. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then next to ""win,"" I could make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer to me. If I can bring the ""win"" rule next to where I am, I can win without moving far. But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to see if it's movable. Since it's a rule, I think it's movable unless it's defined as ""stop.""

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I move that next to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop me, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first.

I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. I need to move right to reach the key. Let me try moving right once to pick up the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to unlock a path or change a rule.

After picking up the key, I can look for a way to use it. Maybe there's a locked door or a rule that requires the key to be moved. But I don't see a door, so perhaps the key is needed to change a rule.

If I move the key next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" That way, when I reach the win rule, I win. But I need to see if that's possible.

I think the best course of action is to move right to pick up the key first. Once I have the key, I can see if it's needed to change a rule or unlock something else. So, I'll choose the right action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier. There are also several walls, which are probably obstacles. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, so walls with ""stop"" can't be moved.

I notice there's a ""ball"" object 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the left, and a ""rule key"" 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Perhaps the key is needed to unlock something.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move these rules to change what Baba is or what counts as ""you.""

I think the strategy should involve moving some rules to create new properties or change existing ones. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then reaching the win condition would be easier. Alternatively, I could try to make the ball or key into something useful.

First, I need to move towards the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule like ""win is something."" But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to change the ball's properties. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball could be controlled, which might help in reaching the win condition.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it ""key is win,"" so that picking up the key would win the level. That could be a quick solution.

But how do I move the rules? I need to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me plan my steps.

I think the best first move is to move right to start getting closer to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. That way, I can start manipulating the rules to my advantage.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Hmm, maybe I need the key to unlock something. There's a ""ball"" nearby, 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used somehow.

I see several walls and other rules like ""stop"" and ""wall"" which might block movement. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, so I need to avoid that. The ""wall"" rules are placed in various positions, so I have to navigate around them.

I also notice a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 4 up, which is near the ""win"" rule. Maybe I can manipulate that to change the rules. There's a ""rule `ball`"" 4 steps right and 2 up, which could be useful if I want to change the ball's properties.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me plan my path. I need to get to the key first because it's closer. From my current position, moving left once should get me to the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a path to the win.

Wait, but how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, sometimes you need to have the right properties. Since I'm Baba, maybe I can just move onto the key. Let me try moving left.

After getting the key, I should look for a door or something that requires a key. But I don't see a door mentioned. Maybe the key is needed to change a rule. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to something else, I might be able to create a new rule like ""key is win"" or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move the ball to a ""rule `is`"" position, I might be able to create a new rule involving the ball. For example, ""ball is you"" would let me control the ball, which might help in reaching the win.

But first, I need to get the key. So, moving left once should get me the key. Let me do that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far. There are also walls, balls, keys, and other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to make progress.

First, I should identify any movable text blocks that can change the rules. For example, if I can move a ""stop"" rule onto a wall, it might make the wall passable. Or maybe I can create a new rule that changes what counts as a win.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to collect the key to unlock something. But to get the key, I might need to move through walls or change their properties.

Let me think about the rules. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that, perhaps I can redefine what a wall is. For instance, if I make ""wall is push,"" walls might become pushable. Or if I make ""wall is stop,"" they become immovable, which might help in creating paths.

There's also a ""ball"" rule at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to push objects or break through walls. If I can make the ball ""is you,"" I could control it, but that might complicate things.

Another idea: if I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then wherever Baba goes, it's a win condition. That could be a quick way to end the level, but I need to see if that's possible.

Looking at the positions, the ""win"" rule is far to the right. Maybe I can create a shortcut by redefining the win condition closer. For example, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would end the level.

I should also consider the ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving or affecting the level.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move that, I could change what Baba is. For example, making ""baba is push"" would allow me to push objects, which could help in rearranging the map.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can change that, maybe I can control other objects besides Baba, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

I think the key steps are:
1. Move towards the key to collect it, but I need to see if the path is clear.
2. Use the key to unlock something, possibly a door or a new rule.
3. Manipulate the rules to redefine walls or other objects to create a path to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the win condition closer. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location.

I should also check if there are any ""is"" rules that I can use to create new properties. For instance, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to a wall and a ""push"" rule, I can make walls pushable.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" rule at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make the ball ""is you,"" I could control it, but that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, making the ball ""is push"" could help in moving objects.

I think the most straightforward approach is to collect the key first. Let me see how to get there. The key is 1 step to the left, but I need to check if there are any walls blocking the path. If there are walls, I might need to redefine them as passable or pushable.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, making it immovable, but that might not help. Maybe I need to make walls passable by redefining them as ""walk"" or something.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the default rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. If I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls out of the way. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to a ""push"" rule. But I don't see a ""push"" rule listed here. Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is push,"" then I can push objects. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to a ""push"" rule. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule in the current setup.

Maybe I can create a new rule by moving an ""is"" rule between two objects. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""push,"" that would create ""baba is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another idea: if I can make ""ball is you,"" I could control the ball and use it to reach higher places or push objects. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the left. If I can move left, I can pick it up. But are there any walls blocking me? Let me check the map again.

The walls are positioned at various steps to the right and up. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is the origin (0,0). The walls are to the right and up, so moving left might be possible if there are no walls blocking that path.

If I move left, I can reach the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can unlock a door or a new rule. But I need to see what the key does. If the key is just an object, maybe I need to use it to break a wall or something.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking it up would end the level. That could be a quick solution. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to a ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is far to the right, so that might be difficult.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can create a new win condition closer by. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am, it's a win. But I need to see if that's possible.

To make ""baba is win,"" I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. But the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, and the ""win"" rule is far to the right. That might require a lot of movement.

Alternatively, I can look for other rules that can help. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. Maybe I can use one of them to create a new rule.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is next to the ""win"" rule. If I can move another rule next to that ""is"" rule, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to that ""is"" rule, I can create ""baba is win.""

But moving the ""baba"" rule that far might be challenging. Let me see the positions again.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. To move it to the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 4 up, I need to move it 9 steps to the right and 6 steps up. That's a lot, and I might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. If I can move it to a more accessible location, that would help. But moving it would require pushing or redefining it.

Wait, if I can make ""win is you,"" then I can control the win condition. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Another approach: use the ball. The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. If I can make the ball ""is push,"" I can use it to push objects. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and use it to reach higher places. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move left to pick it up. Let me try that.

If I move left, I can reach the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door or a new rule. But I need to see what the key does. If the key is just an object, maybe I need to use it to break a wall or something.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking it up would end the level. That could be a quick solution. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to a ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is far to the right, so that might be difficult.

Alternatively, I can look for other rules that can help. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. Maybe I can use one of them to create a new rule.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is next to the ""win"" rule. If I can move another rule next to that ""is"" rule, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to that ""is"" rule, I can create ""baba is win.""

But moving the ""baba"" rule that far might be challenging. Let me see the positions again.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. To move it to the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 4 up, I need to move it 9 steps to the right and 6 steps up. That's a lot, and I might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. If I can move it to a more accessible location, that would help. But moving it would require pushing or redefining it.

Wait, if I can make ""win is you,"" then I can control the win condition. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Another idea: use the ball. The ""ball"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. If I can make the ball ""is push,"" I can use it to push objects. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" rule 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, and a key object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to collect the key to unlock something.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to break walls or something. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, which might mean that if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it could make the wall stop me.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change what Baba is or what counts as winning.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. I need to figure out how to get to the win condition. Maybe I should start by moving towards the key or the ball. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key and the ball.

Wait, but there are walls in the way. I need to see if I can move the rules to change the properties of the walls. For example, if I can make a wall into a ""stop"" or ""you,"" it might affect how I can move through them.

I think the best first step is to move right to get closer to the key and the ball. That way, I can see if I can use them to manipulate the rules or break through walls.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and other things. The key is one step to the left, which might be important. There are also several rule blocks like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change how objects behave. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or move these rule blocks. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or change what counts as a win.

Let me see the positions. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. The ""key"" is only one step to the left, so maybe I can get it quickly. If I can get the key, maybe it can help me unlock something or change a rule.

I also notice there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can combine them with other words to make new rules. For example, if I can move ""key"" next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I could make ""key is you,"" which might let me control the key or use it in some way.

Wait, but I'm already Baba, so maybe I can make myself into something else. If I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then I myself would be the win condition, which might end the level immediately. That could be a quick way to solve it.

Alternatively, I could try to make the key the win condition. If I can move ""key"" next to ""is"" and ""win,"" then ""key is win"" would mean that getting the key would win the level. Since the key is close, that might be a good strategy.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I need to get next to them and push them. Let me plan my path. I'm currently at the starting position. The key is one step to the left, so I can move left to get it. But I need to see if there are any walls blocking me. The walls are positioned in a way that might require me to move around them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. That means if I move up three times, I'll hit a stop, which might prevent me from moving further. I need to avoid that or find a way to change it.

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. If I can move ""stop"" next to a wall, then that wall would become a stop, which might block movement through it. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that overrides ""stop."" If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop effect would be removed. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Let me focus on the key. If I can get the key, maybe it can help me unlock a path or change a rule. The key is one step to the left, so I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to move other objects or change rules.

Wait, but in Baba Is You, the key is usually used to open locks, but here I don't see any locks. Maybe the key is part of a rule. If I can make ""key is win,"" then getting the key would win the level.

So, my plan is: move left to get the key, then move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win."" Once that rule is active, I can move to the key, and that would trigger the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one 7 steps to the right and 4 up, another 2 steps right and 2 up, and another 1 step left and 2 down. Maybe I can move one of these to combine with ""key"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to Baba. That way, I myself become the win condition, and the level would end when I step on the win block.

Wait, but the win block is 8 steps right and 4 up, which is quite far. Maybe it's easier to make ""key is win"" since the key is closer.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule that's 2 steps right and 2 up. If I can move it next to ""key"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win."" But I need to check if the positions allow that.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""key"" and ""is."" The ""win"" rule is 8 steps right and 4 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move it down or left.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step left and 2 down. If I can move it up, I can combine it with ""key"" and ""win.""

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can make myself able to move through walls. If I can create a rule like ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that might not help. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is already 3 steps up, which might be a wall that stops me.

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall to make that wall stop movement. But I'm not sure if that's useful.

Let me try to focus on the key again. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to change the win condition. So, first, I'll move left to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can look for an ""is"" rule to combine with ""key"" and ""win."" Let's say I move the ""is"" rule that's 2 steps right and 2 up to be next to ""key"" and ""win."" That would create ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition.

So, my steps would be:

1. Move left to get the key.
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""
3. Move to the key to win the level.

But I need to make sure I can move the rule blocks. Let me see if there's a clear path to move the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule at 2 right and 2 up is near the ball and other walls. Maybe I can move it up or right to position it correctly.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the key is. But that might require moving through walls, which I can't do unless I change the rules.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is pass"" by moving the ""pass"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""is."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Hmm.

Alternatively, I can make ""baba is pass"" if I can find a ""pass"" rule, but I don't see one. So that's not possible.

Let me try to proceed with the key plan. I'll move left to get the key, then try to position the ""is"" rule to make ""key is win.""

So, first action: move left to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The rules are spread out, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" The key is one step to the left, which might be important.

I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to reach the win. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects or rules. The walls are immovable because they have the ""stop"" property, so I can't go through them. The ball is somewhere on the map, but I'm not sure how it's relevant yet.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes what counts as winning. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then getting the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. But how? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" The key is one step to the left, so maybe I can move it towards the ""win"" rule.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me see the layout. The key is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 up. So the key is directly below the ""win"" rule. If I can move the key up three steps, it would be next to the ""win"" rule, forming ""key is win.""

But how do I move the key? I can only move it if it's not a ""stop."" The key doesn't have a ""stop"" property, so I can push it. I need to get to the key's position, which is 9 right and 1 up. But I'm starting at the origin, so I need to move right 9 steps and up 1 step. That's a lot of steps, but maybe I can find a shortcut.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win."" For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" that would change the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule between ""key"" and ""win.""

Looking at the ""is"" rules, there are several. One is at 8 right and 4 up, which is next to ""win."" If I can move another ""is"" to be between ""key"" and ""win,"" that would form the new rule.

Wait, the ""key"" is at 9 right and 1 up, and ""win"" is at 9 right and 4 up. So if I can move an ""is"" to 9 right and 2 up, then ""key is win"" would be formed when I move the key up.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" up to meet the ""win"" rule. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right 9 steps to reach the column where the key and win are.
2. Move up 1 step to reach the key.
3. Push the key up 3 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.

But I'm not sure if I can push the key that far. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to connect ""key"" and ""win.""

Another idea: If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key, allowing me to interact with the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is you."" But ""baba is you"" is the active rule, so maybe I can rearrange it.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba,"" then ""baba is key"" would be formed, making me the key.

So, steps:

1. Move left 1 step to reach the ""baba"" rule.
2. Move down 2 steps to get closer.
3. Then, move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" to form ""baba is key.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible because the key is far away. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""win"" next to something else. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball would become the win condition. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ball is at 2 right and 3 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, that would change the win condition to the ball. But I'm not sure if that's useful.

Another thought: The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can move that, I can make walls passable. But I don't see an immediate benefit.

Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to create ""key is win."" That way, when I get the key, I win. So, I need to move the key up 3 steps to reach the ""win"" rule's position.

But how do I move the key? I can only push it if it's adjacent. So I need to get next to the key first.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move right 9 steps to reach the key's column.
2. Move up 1 step to reach the key.
3. Push the key up 3 steps to reach the ""win"" rule at 9 right and 4 up.

But I'm not sure if I can push the key that far. Maybe I can only push it one step at a time. So I need to move up with the key step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to connect ""key"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up, which is next to ""win."" If I can move another ""is"" to 9 right and 3 up, then ""key is win"" would be formed when the key is moved up.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should try to move the key up step by step.

So, first, I need to get to the key's position. Let's see:

- Starting position: origin (0,0)
- Key is at (9,1)
- So, I need to move right 9 times and up 1 time.

But that's a lot of steps, and I might hit walls along the way. Let me check the walls:

- Walls are at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, etc. So the path to the key might be blocked.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So moving right 9 steps would require going around the walls. Maybe I can move up first to bypass the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a shorter path. Let me see:

- The key is at 9 right and 1 up.
- There's a wall at 4 right and 4 up, but maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, etc. So moving right beyond 4 might be blocked. Hmm, this is confusing.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see if I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win.""

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. The ""key"" rule is at 9 right and 1 up. So if I can move an ""is"" rule to 9 right and 2 up, then when I move the key up, it would form ""key is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule there? The ""is"" rules are at various positions. One is at 8 right and 4 up, which is next to ""win."" If I can move that ""is"" down to 9 right and 3 up, then I can connect ""key"" and ""win.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule that way. Maybe I can push it down.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 4 up is next to ""win."" If I move left from there, I can get to 7 right and 4 up, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 3 right and 2 up to the desired position.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the key up step by step, even if it takes many moves.

So, plan:

1. Move right 9 steps to reach the key's column.
2. Move up 1 step to reach the key.
3. Push the key up 3 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.

But I'm not sure if I can do that without hitting walls. Let me check the walls again.

Walls are at 4 right and various up positions, but I'm moving to 9 right, which is beyond that. So maybe the path is clear.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, etc., but I'm moving to 9 right, so I should be fine.

So, I'll proceed with moving right 9 steps, then up 1 step to get to the key, then push it up 3 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.

But I need to make sure I can push the key. Since the key is an object, I can push it if it's adjacent.

So, first, move right 9 times:

right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

Then, up once:

up.

Now, I'm next to the key. I can push it up:

up.

But I need to push it three times. So:

up, up, up.

Each time, I move up with the key.

After that, the key is at 9 right and 4 up, next to the ""win"" rule. Now, the rule ""key is win"" is formed, so when I pick up the key, I win.

But wait, do I need to pick up the key, or does the rule automatically make me win when I have the key?

I think in Baba Is You, once the rule is created, having the key would make me win. So, after moving the key next to ""win,"" I just need to have the key in my possession.

But I'm already next to the key, so maybe I can just move into it to pick it up.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and the key is an object. So, moving into the key would pick it up, but I need to make sure the rule is active.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move into the key after creating the rule, and that would trigger the win.

So, after pushing the key up three times, I can move into it to pick it up, which would make me win.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I need to have the key in my inventory.

Alternatively, maybe the rule ""key is win"" means that the key itself is the win condition, so when I reach it, I win.

But I'm already next to it, so maybe I just need to move into it.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and the key is an object. So, moving into it would pick it up, but I need to see if that triggers the win.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the key next to ""win"" and then move into the ""win"" rule.

I'm a bit confused, but I think the key step is to move the key next to ""win"" to create the rule, and then have the key in my possession to win.

So, to summarize, the steps are:

1. Move right 9 times to reach the key's column.
2. Move up once to reach the key.
3. Push the key up three times to reach the ""win"" rule's position.
4. Move into the key to pick it up, which would trigger the win.

But I'm not sure if I can push the key that far. Maybe I can only push it one step at a time, so I need to move up with the key step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""key"" and ""win"" without moving the key.

But I think moving the key is the more straightforward approach.

So, I'll proceed with moving right 9 times, then up once, then push the key up three times.

But wait, each push requires me to be adjacent to the key and then move into it, which would push it. So, for each step up, I need to move up while pushing the key.

So, the actions would be:

right x9, up, up (pushing key up), up (pushing key up again), up (pushing key up again).

But I'm not sure if that's the correct sequence. Maybe I need to alternate moving and pushing.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move up while holding the key, but I think I need to push it.

This is a bit tricky, but I think the main idea is to move the key next to the ""win"" rule to create the new rule, then pick up the key to win.

So, I'll choose the action to move right to start.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other text blocks. The walls are positioned in various places, which might block my movement. The rules are scattered around, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I notice that the key is one step to the left. Maybe I need to collect it to unlock something. The ball is also on the map, but I'm not sure what it does yet. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the right and three steps up, which might mean that if I move that rule, I can change what stops movement.

The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and four steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can redefine what wins. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and two steps down, and the ""you"" rule is two steps to the right and two steps down. If I can move these, I might be able to change who I am or what I can do.

I think the key is important here. Since it's only one step to the left, maybe I can move left to pick it up. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are at various positions, but I don't see one directly to the left of me, so maybe I can move left safely.

Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock a door or change a rule. The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up, so if I can move that, I might be able to make the key do something else or make another object act as a key.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a different object, I can change what I need to do to win. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level.

But first, I need to get closer to the key. Let me try moving left to pick it up. If that's blocked, I might need to move other rules around to clear the path.

Wait, I also see a ""stop"" rule. If I can move that, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving or affecting me. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Another idea: if I can move the ""baba"" rule, I might be able to make Baba into something else, like a key or a ball, which could help me interact with the level differently.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move left to get the key. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to unlock something?

The rules on the map include ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you."" I can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" maybe walls can be stopped, making them immovable. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

I see a ""ball"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe if I can make the ball do something, like push walls or change rules. But I'm not sure how to utilize that yet.

The key is 1 step to the left. If I can pick up the key, maybe it can help me unlock a path to the win condition. But how do I get to the key? It's only 1 step left, so maybe I can move left from my current position.

Wait, I'm at the starting point. Let me visualize the map. Walls are scattered around, but the key is close. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule or unlock a door, but I don't see a door mentioned here.

Alternatively, maybe the key is part of a rule. The ""key"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's near the ""win"" rule. Maybe if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key.

But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule. However, rules are text blocks, and I can only move them if they're not defined as ""STOP."" I need to check if ""key"" is stoppable. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move ""stop"" next to ""key,"" then ""key is stop,"" making it immovable. But I don't want that; I want to move the ""key"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""key"" next to ""win."" If I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule closer to ""win.""

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I can only move text blocks if they're not stopped. So, I need to make sure ""key"" isn't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is separate, so maybe I can move ""stop"" away or change it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" making ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls immovable. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me think differently. My goal is to reach the ""win"" object. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a long way. Maybe I can change the win condition to something closer, like the key.

If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. So, how do I do that? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" The ""key"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, and ""win"" is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, they're in the same column but different rows. If I can move the ""key"" rule up, it can be next to ""win.""

But moving rules requires me to be adjacent to them. I'm currently at the starting point, so I need to navigate to where the ""key"" rule is. That's 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a long path, and there might be walls blocking me.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""baba"" next to ""key,"" making ""baba is key."" Then, I would become the key, which might allow me to interact with locks or something. But I don't see a lock mentioned here.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can make the ball push walls or something. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then the ball can move walls, creating a path.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule mentioned. The available rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" So, I can only use these to create new rules.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win the level by being myself. But that might not be possible because ""baba is you"" is already the active rule.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move ""you"" next to ""win,"" making ""you is win,"" then being you (which I am as Baba) would win the level. That could work.

So, how do I move the ""you"" rule? It's 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. I need to navigate there, pick it up, and move it next to ""win.""

But moving rules requires me to be adjacent to them. So, I need to get to where ""you"" is, which is 1 right and 2 down from my current position. Let me see if that's possible.

Looking at the map, there are walls around, but I can move left, right, up, or down as long as I don't hit a wall. The key is 1 step to the left, so moving left would get me the key. But I need to go down to get to ""you.""

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So, from my starting position, I need to move right once and down twice. Let me check if that path is clear.

The objects on the map include walls at various positions. For example, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up, but that's far. Closer walls are at 4 steps right and 3 up, etc. I need to see if the path to ""you"" is blocked.

Assuming the path is clear, I can move right once and down twice to reach the ""you"" rule. Then, I can pick it up and move it next to ""win.""

But wait, can I carry rules? In Baba Is You, you can pick up and move text blocks by moving into them. So, if I move into the ""you"" rule, I can carry it. Then, I can move it next to ""win"" to create ""you is win.""

Once ""you is win"" is active, since I am Baba and ""baba is you,"" I would automatically win by being present. But I need to make sure that ""you is win"" is correctly formed.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" directly by moving ""baba"" next to ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, I can move left twice and down twice to reach it, then carry it to ""win.""

But that's a longer path. Maybe moving ""you"" is easier.

Another approach: the ""key"" is 1 step to the left. If I pick up the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule. For example, moving ""key"" next to ""win"" to make ""key is win,"" then I just need to pick up the key.

But I'm not sure if the key is a movable object or a rule. The ""key"" rule is 9 steps right and 1 step up, but the key object is 1 step left. So, the key object is separate.

Wait, the key object is 1 step to the left. So, I can move left once to pick it up. Then, maybe I can use it to change a rule. But how?

If I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door, but I don't see a door. Alternatively, maybe the key can be used to move rules. For example, placing the key next to a rule to change it.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on changing the win condition.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Then, move to where the ""you"" rule is (1 right, 2 down).
3. Pick up the ""you"" rule.
4. Move it next to ""win"" (9 right, 4 up) to create ""you is win.""
5. Then, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I would win.

But moving all the way to ""win"" is a long path. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving ""baba"" next to ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down. So, I can move left once and down twice to pick it up, then move it to ""win.""

But again, that's a long path.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""ball"" next to ""win,"" making ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to reach the ball. The ball is 2 steps right and 3 up. So, if I can get to the ball, I can win.

But how do I get to the ball? It's 2 right and 3 up. Let me see if that's possible.

From my starting position, moving right twice and up three times. Are there walls blocking that path? The walls are at various positions, but I'm not sure if they block that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball push walls. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then the ball can move walls, creating a path.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. The available rules are limited, so I can only use what's there.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become immovable, which might help in creating a path.

The ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up. If I move ""stop"" next to ""wall,"" making ""wall is stop,"" then walls can't be moved. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, if walls are stoppable, maybe I can use the ball to push other objects, but without a ""push"" rule, I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move the ""you"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""you is win."" Here's how:

1. Move right once and down twice to reach the ""you"" rule.
2. Pick it up by moving into it.
3. Then, move it to the position of ""win,"" which is 9 right and 4 up.

But that's a long distance. I need to make sure the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 4 up. If I can move it down, it would be closer.

But moving ""win"" requires me to be adjacent to it, which is a long way.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""baba"" next to ""win,"" making ""baba is win."" Then, I would win by being Baba.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 2 down. So, I can move left once and down twice to pick it up, then move it next to ""win.""

But again, that's a long path.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is win"" by moving the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" The ""key"" rule is 9 right and 1 up, and ""win"" is 9 right and 4 up. So, if I can move the ""key"" rule up three steps, it would be next to ""win,"" creating ""key is win.""

Then, I just need to pick up the key, which is 1 step left, and that would win the level.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right 9 times and up 1 time to reach the ""key"" rule.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move it up 3 times to be next to ""win.""
4. Then, move left 9 times and down 1 time to get back to the key object.
5. Pick up the key to win.

But that seems too long and might not be feasible due to walls.

Wait, maybe I can do it differently. If I can make ""key is win,"" then the key becomes the win condition. So, I just need to pick up the key.

But to make ""key is win,"" I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""win."" The ""key"" rule is 9 right and 1 up, and ""win"" is 9 right and 4 up. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule up 3 steps.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it, which requires me to navigate there.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""win,"" but that's already the case.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 8 right and 4 up, next to ""win."" So, ""win"" is already defined as ""win is win,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe I can change that.

If I move another rule next to ""win,"" like ""key,"" then ""key is win.""

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""key"" rule next to ""win"" to create ""key is win.""
2. Then, pick up the key object to win.

But to move the ""key"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. So, I need to navigate to 9 right and 1 up.

But that's a long path. Let me see if I can find a shorter way.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ""ball"" rule is 5 right and 2 up. If I can make the ball do something, like push walls, I can create a path.

But without a ""push"" rule, I can't make the ball push. Unless I create a new rule.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is push,"" then the ball can push walls. But I don't have a ""push"" rule. The available rules are limited.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball. Then, I can move the ball to push something.

But I'm not sure. Let me think.

If I make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes controllable. Then, I can move the ball to push walls or something. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so reaching the ball wins the level. The ball is 2 right and 3 up. So, if I can make ""ball is win,"" I just need to reach the ball.

To make ""ball is win,"" I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win."" The ""ball"" rule is 5 right and 2 up, and ""win"" is 9 right and 4 up. So, I need to move the ""ball"" rule 4 right and 2 up.

But that's a long distance. I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving ""baba"" next to ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 2 down. So, I can move left once and down twice to pick it up, then move it 9 right and 4 up to be next to ""win.""

But that's a long path, and I might hit walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win"" by moving ""you"" next to ""win."" The ""you"" rule is 1 right and 2 down. So, I can move right once and down twice to pick it up, then move it 8 right and 2 up to be next to ""win.""

But again, that's a long path.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to change a rule. The key is 1 step left. If I pick it up, maybe I can use it to move a rule.

For example, if I have the key, I can place it next to a rule to change it. But I'm not sure how that works exactly.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock a door, but I don't see a door mentioned.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""you"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""you is win."" Here's how:

1. Move right once and down twice to reach the ""you"" rule.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move it 8 right and 2 up to be next to ""win.""
4. Then, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I would win.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. Let me check the walls.

The walls are at various positions, but I'm not sure if they block the path. Assuming the path is clear, I can proceed.

So, the first step is to move right once and down twice to reach the ""you"" rule. Then, pick it up and move it next to ""win.""

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? I can carry it by moving into it, then move it to the desired location.

Once ""you is win"" is active, I just need to be present, which I am as Baba.

So, the actions would be:

1. Move right.
2. Move down.
3. Move down again to reach the ""you"" rule.
4. Move into the ""you"" rule to pick it up.
5. Move right 8 times and up 2 times to place it next to ""win.""
6. Then, I would win automatically.

But I'm not sure if I can move that far without hitting walls. Maybe there's a shorter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving ""baba"" next to ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 2 down. So, I can move left once and down twice to pick","

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, and a key. The walls are placed in various positions, which might block my path. The rules are scattered around, and some of them are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" 

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That seems pretty far, but maybe I can get there by moving through the map. However, there are walls in the way, so I need to see if I can break through them or find a path around.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I remember that in Baba Is You, objects can be manipulated by changing the rules. If I can make the ball into something useful, like a tool to break walls, that might help. But right now, the ball is just an object.

There's also a key 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. Keys are often used to unlock doors or other objects, so maybe I need to get the key to proceed further. But again, the walls might be blocking my path.

I see that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which are essential because they define what is what. For example, ""baba is you"" makes Baba the player. If I can rearrange these rules, I might be able to change the properties of objects. For instance, if I can make ""ball is push"" or ""wall is break,"" that could open up new possibilities.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can make something ""stop,"" it might prevent certain actions, but I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can change this rule, maybe I can make walls passable or make them stop moving. But I'm not sure how to approach that yet.

The ""key"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is the same position as the key object. That might mean that the key is defined by that rule, so if I can manipulate it, I might be able to unlock something.

I also see that there are multiple ""baba"" and ""you"" rules. If I can change ""baba is you"" to something else, maybe I can gain new abilities or change my properties. But I need to be careful because that could also make me unable to move or interact with the environment.

Given all this, I think the best approach is to try to move towards the key or the win condition. Since the key is closer, maybe I can get it first. But I need to see if there's a clear path. Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to gain abilities that help me reach the win.

Wait, I also notice that there's a ""ball"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can make the ball into a tool, like ""ball is push,"" I could push it to break walls or reach higher places. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Another thought: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that might make it easier to reach. But I don't know how to do that yet. Maybe by rearranging the rules, I can redefine what ""win"" means or where it is.

I'm also considering if I can make myself into something else. For example, if I can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I don't know if that's allowed or how to do it.

Given the complexity, I think the safest first step is to move towards the key. It's 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is quite far, but maybe I can find a path. Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to gain abilities that help me reach the key or win faster.

Wait, I also see that there's a ""stop"" rule. If I can make something ""stop,"" maybe I can prevent walls from blocking me or stop myself from moving into dangerous areas. But I'm not sure how to apply that yet.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rules around, I might be able to create new rules that give me advantages. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I could push walls out of the way. Or if I can make ""ball is break,"" I could break through walls with the ball.

I'm also thinking about the ""you"" rule. If I can change ""you"" to something else, like ""you is win,"" then reaching the win condition would be easier. But I need to figure out how to do that without breaking the game.

Overall, I'm a bit overwhelmed by the number of rules and objects. I think the best approach is to start by moving towards the key and see if I can unlock something that will help me manipulate the rules further. Alternatively, I could try to rearrange the rules to gain abilities that make reaching the win condition easier.

Wait, I just realized that the ""key"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is the same position as the ""win"" rule. That might mean that getting the key is necessary to win, or that the key is part of the win condition. I need to prioritize getting the key.

But to get to the key, I need to move 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's a long way, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I can find a path around the walls or manipulate them to make the path clear.

Alternatively, I could try to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" I could walk through them. But I don't know how to do that yet.

Another thought: if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I might be able to change the properties of walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that might prevent me from moving through them, but I'm not sure if that helps.

I'm also considering if I can use the ball to break walls. If I can make ""ball is break,"" I could throw the ball at walls to destroy them. But I need to figure out how to create that rule.

Wait, I see that there's a ""ball"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule next to the ball object, I might be able to create a new rule like ""ball is break."" That could help me break through walls.

So, maybe my first step should be to move towards the ""ball"" rule and the ball object to create a new rule. That way, I can gain the ability to break walls and clear a path to the key or win.

But I need to plan my movements carefully. I don't want to get stuck or move in the wrong direction. Let me try to visualize the map based on the descriptions.

The walls are placed at various positions, but the key is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's quite far, so I need to find a way to get there without being blocked by walls.

Alternatively, if I can manipulate the rules to make myself faster or to teleport, that would help, but I don't see any rules that allow for that yet.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I need to see if that's possible by rearranging the rules.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""win,"" I might be able to create a rule like ""you is win,"" which would make me win when I reach the win condition.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. I need to think about the possible moves and how they can affect the rules.

Overall, I think the best approach is to try to manipulate the rules to gain abilities that help me reach the key or win. Specifically, I should try to create a rule that allows me to break walls or make walls passable. That way, I can clear a path and reach my goal.

So, my first step is to move towards the ""ball"" rule and the ball object to create a new rule like ""ball is break."" Once I have that ability, I can break through walls and proceed towards the key or win.

But I need to make sure I don't get stuck or move in a way that blocks my progress. I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""ball"" rule and the ball object.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the usual ""WIN"" rule. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I should note where the key is. It's one step to the left. Maybe I need to pick it up to unlock something. The ball is one step to the right and three steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to break something or change a rule.

The rules present are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I can move these rules to create new combinations. For example, if I move the ""key"" rule next to ""is,"" I can make ""key is something,"" which might change the key's properties.

I also see that there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the right and three steps up. If I can make ""stop"" apply to something else, maybe I can make walls stop being solid, allowing me to pass through them.

My initial thought is to move towards the key since it's close. But I need to check if moving the key or other rules can help me reach the win condition more effectively. Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule that changes the win condition to something easier to reach.

Let me visualize the map. The walls are mostly on the right side, creating a sort of barrier. The ""WIN"" rule is eight steps to the right and four steps up, which is quite far. The key is just one step to the left, so maybe I can pick it up quickly.

If I move left to get the key, I can then see if the key can be used to unlock a path or change a rule. Once I have the key, perhaps I can move it next to a rule to create a new rule, like ""key is win,"" which would make the key the new win condition, making it easier to finish the level.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to push walls or something. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Another idea is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" to make ""stop is something,"" which might stop the walls from blocking me. But I'm not sure how that would work exactly.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move left to pick up the key, then use it to create a new rule that changes the win condition to the key itself. That way, I can just pick up the key and win the level without having to navigate all the walls.

So, my plan is to move left to get the key, then move the key next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win."" Once that's done, I can just pick up the key to win.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move the key. Since the key is an object, I can pick it up and carry it around. So, moving left to get the key is the first step.

Let me check the positions again. The key is one step to the left. So, moving left from my current position should get me to the key. Once I have the key, I can move it to where I need it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" without picking up the key object. That might change the rule to ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. Then, I just need to pick up the key to win.

I think that's a better approach because it doesn't require carrying the key around. I can just move the ""key"" rule into position to change the win condition.

So, I need to move the ""key"" rule, which is eight steps to the right and one step up, next to ""is"" and ""win."" But that might be too far. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""

Wait, the ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and four steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer to ""is"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""key"" and ""is"" to make ""key is win."" That would change the win condition to the key.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""win"" rule. Let me check the objects. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and four steps up. It's a rule, so I can move it.

So, my plan is to move the ""win"" rule next to ""key"" and ""is"" to create ""key is win."" That way, picking up the key will make me win.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to move towards it. It's eight steps to the right and four steps up. That's a long way, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I can find a path around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls will stop me, but if I can change that, maybe I can walk through them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps up. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls will stop me, but if I can change that to ""wall is not stop,"" maybe I can pass through them.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""is"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but that would make walls stop me, which is the default. I need to reverse it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""not stop"" to make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule here.

Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go. Let me think differently.

I need to reach the ""WIN"" rule, which is eight steps to the right and four steps up. There are walls blocking the way, but maybe I can move some rules to change the walls' properties.

If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control the walls, but that might not help me pass through them.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is win,"" then stepping on a wall would make me win, but that might not be useful.

Wait, the key is one step to the left. Maybe I can pick it up and then use it to change a rule. For example, if I have the key, I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win,"" which would allow me to win by picking up the key.

So, let me try that. I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But how do I move the key? I can carry it, so I can move it wherever I want. So, after picking it up, I can move it to the position where ""is"" and ""win"" are.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and four steps up, and ""win"" is eight steps to the right and four steps up. So, if I move the key next to them, I can form ""key is win.""

But that's a long way. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Let me check the objects again.

There's a ""is"" rule two steps to the right and two steps up. That's closer. If I can move the key next to that ""is"" and ""win,"" but ""win"" is far away. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key and ""win.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's two steps to the right and two steps up next to the key. Then, I can form ""key is something.""

But I need to make ""key is win."" So, I need to have ""key,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" in a line. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. That's still far.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can break down the current rules.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. The walls are solid because ""wall is stop"" is probably a default rule, but I don't see it listed. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three steps up. So, maybe ""wall is stop"" is an implicit rule.

If I can change that, I can make walls passable. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is you,"" which would let me control walls, but that might not help me pass through them.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is win,"" then stepping on a wall would make me win. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution.

Let me think about the key again. The key is one step to the left. If I pick it up, I can use it to change a rule. For example, if I move the key next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""key is win,"" which would allow me to win by picking up the key.

So, my steps would be:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move the key next to the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule to form ""key is win.""
3. Pick up the key to win the level.

But I need to make sure I can move the key to the right position. Let me check the positions again.

The key is one step to the left. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and four steps up, and ""win"" is eight steps to the right and four steps up. That's too far. Alternatively, there's an ""is"" rule two steps to the right and two steps up. Maybe I can use that.

So, after picking up the key, I can move it next to the ""is"" rule that's two steps to the right and two steps up, and then next to the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is still far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key and ""is,"" that would work. But moving the ""win"" rule eight steps to the right and four steps up is a lot, and there are walls in the way.

Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key the win condition without moving the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win"" by rearranging the existing rules.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and the ""win"" rule, I can form ""key is win."" But that's a long distance.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and ""is"" rule. But again, that's a long way.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can change the win condition to something else, like the ball.

The ball is one step to the right and three steps up. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I just need to pick up the ball to win. That might be easier.

So, I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" Then, I can go pick up the ball.

But the ""ball"" rule is four steps to the right and two steps up. I need to move it next to ""is"" and ""win."" Let me see if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and the ""win"" rule. But that might require moving the ""is"" rule a long way.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule two steps to the right and two steps up. Maybe I can use that.

So, if I move the ""ball"" rule next to that ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule, I can make ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to pick up the ball.

But the ""win"" rule is still far away. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball the win condition without moving the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is win"" by rearranging the rules.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is four steps to the right and two steps up. The ""is"" rule is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to them, I can form ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule eight steps to the right and four steps up is too far. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and then next to the ""win"" rule. But that's still a long way.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first and see if that helps.

So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can see if I can use it to change a rule.

After picking up the key, I can move it next to the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win."" That way, I can just pick up the key to win.

But I need to make sure I can move the key to the right position. Let me check the positions again.

The key is one step to the left. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and four steps up, and ""win"" is eight steps to the right and four steps up. That's too far. Alternatively, I can use the closer ""is"" rule.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the key next to that ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule, I can make ""key is win.""

But the ""win"" rule is still far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key the win condition without moving the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win"" by rearranging the existing rules.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is eight steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and the ""win"" rule, I can form ""key is win."" But that's a long distance.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and ""is"" rule. But again, that's a long way.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can change the win condition to something else, like the ball.

The ball is one step to the right and three steps up. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I just need to pick up the ball to win. That might be easier.

So, I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" Then, I can go pick up the ball.

But the ""ball"" rule is four steps to the right and two steps up. I need to move it next to ""is"" and ""win."" Let me see if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and the ""win"" rule. But that might require moving the ""is"" rule a long way.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule two steps to the right and two steps up. Maybe I can use that.

So, if I move the ""ball"" rule next to that ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule, I can make ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to pick up the ball.

But the ""win"" rule is still far away. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the ball the win condition without moving the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is win"" by rearranging the rules.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is four steps to the right and two steps up. The ""is"" rule is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to them, I can form ""ball is win.""

But moving the ""win"" rule eight steps to the right and four steps up is too far. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and then next to the ""win"" rule. But that's still a long way.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first and see if that helps.

So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can see if I can use it to change a rule.

After picking up the key, I can move it next to the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win."" That way, I can just pick up the key to win.

But I need to make sure I can move the key to the right position. Let me check the positions again.

The key is one step to the left. The ""is"" rule is seven steps to the right and four steps up, and ""win"" is eight steps to the right and four steps up. That's too far. Alternatively, I can use the closer ""is"" rule.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the key next to that ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule, I can make ""key is win.""

But the ""win"" rule is still far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. But that's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key the win condition without moving the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can make ""key is win"" by rearranging the existing rules.
