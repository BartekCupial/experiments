Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps right and 3 up. Then, there are several rule blocks: key, is, win, wall, is, stop, etc., spread out. There's also a key at 8 right and 2 up, a ball at 5 right and 1 up, a door rule at 6 right and 1 up, and more walls.

My goal is to win, which means I need to get the key. But the key is behind some walls, I think. Let me visualize the map. The key is at 8 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right, but there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; and 4 right, same level. So, there's a vertical line of walls at 4 right, from 3 up to 1 down. That's a solid barrier.

I can't move through walls because ""wall is stop"". So, I need to find a way to change the rules to make the walls passable or to move the key closer. Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition.

Wait, the current win condition is ""key is win"". If I can change that, maybe I can win without getting the key. But I don't see another win object. Alternatively, maybe I can make something else the win condition.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""door"" is a rule at 6 right, 1 up. Maybe if I can make the door the win condition, but I don't see a door object. Or perhaps I can create a new rule.

Another approach: maybe I can move the key closer. The key is at 8 right, 2 up. To get it, I need to move right past the walls. Since the walls are at 4 right, I can't go beyond that. Unless I can change the wall's property.

If I can make walls not stop, then I can pass through them. How? I need to change the rule ""wall is stop"". To do that, I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" blocks to create a new rule.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 2 up, and a ""stop"" rule at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block away from the ""wall"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule where wall is something else.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks appropriately. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 8 right, 3 up, and another ""is"" at 2 up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to combine with ""wall"" and ""something else"".

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move it to make ""key is something else"", but I'm not sure.

Another idea: the ball is at 5 right, 1 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls, but I don't know if that's possible. Or perhaps the ball can be used to create a new rule.

Wait, the door rule is at 6 right, 1 up. If I can make the door open, maybe I can get through. But I don't see a door object, just the rule. Maybe I can create a door by moving the rule blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a different object. Since ""baba is you"", if I can change that rule, I can become something else. For example, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I would be the key and win immediately. But how?

To change ""baba is you"", I need to move either the ""baba"" or ""you"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right, 3 down. If I can move the ""you"" block to another position, maybe I can create a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""you"" block to combine with ""key"", making ""key is you"", then I would be the key, and thus win. But how do I move the ""you"" block? I need to get to it, but it's 1 right, 3 down. That's below me, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I would be the key and win.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move the ""is"" block to between ""baba"" and ""key"". The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. That's a long distance. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is something else"". If I can make ""key is win"" into ""key is you"", then I would be the key. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the current rule is ""key is win"". If I can change that to ""key is you"", then I would be the key, and thus win. How? I need to move the ""win"" block to replace it with ""you"".

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 3 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 3 down. So, I need to move the ""you"" block up to 9 right, 3 up, replacing ""win"". But that's a long way. I can't move through walls, so I need to find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I would be the key. Let me see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one at 8 right, 3 up, and another at 2 up.

If I can move the ""is"" block at 8 right, 3 up to between ""baba"" and ""key"", that would create ""baba is key"". But that's a long move. I'm at the starting position, which I think is the origin (0,0). So, to get to the ""is"" block at 8 right, 3 up, I need to move right 8 and up 3, but the walls are blocking me at 4 right.

Hmm, maybe I need to break the wall rule first. If I can make walls not stop, then I can pass through them. How? I need to change ""wall is stop"" to something else.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up, and ""stop"" is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, and walls would no longer stop. Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""wall is not stop"".

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block to another position. Let's see, the ""stop"" block is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move it down or somewhere else, the original rule would be broken.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? I need to get to it. It's at 1 right, 2 up. From my starting position, I can move right 1 and up 2. But are there walls in the way? Let me check.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; and 4 right, same level. So, to get to 1 right, 2 up, I just need to move right 1 and up 2. There are no walls blocking that path because the walls start at 4 right. So, I can reach the ""stop"" block.

So, my plan is:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 2 up.
2. Move it somewhere else to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But wait, I can only move one block at a time. So, I need to move the ""stop"" block to a new position, which would create a new rule or break the existing one.

If I move the ""stop"" block to, say, 1 right, 3 up, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken because the ""stop"" is no longer next to ""wall"". Instead, ""wall"" would be next to whatever is at 1 right, 2 up after moving.

Wait, no. The rule is formed by three blocks: subject, IS, property. So, if I move the ""stop"" block, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken because the ""stop"" is no longer in the correct position. Instead, the ""wall"" would be connected to whatever is next to it.

Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" block to another position, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be removed, and walls would no longer stop. That would allow me to pass through walls.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" block. Let me see how to do that.

First, I need to get to the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 2 up. From my starting position, I can move right once and up twice.

But wait, the starting position is where ""baba is you"" is. So, I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left, 3 down. Wait, no, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down, but I'm the player, so I'm at the position where ""baba is you"" is defined. So, I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left, 3 down. Or maybe I'm at the origin.

Wait, the initial position isn't clear. Let me re-examine the objects. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right, 3 down. So, the rule ""baba is you"" is formed by these three blocks. So, I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left, 3 down.

Wait, that can't be right because the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down, and ""is"" is at 3 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right, 3 down. So, the rule is ""baba is you"" formed by those three blocks.

So, I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left, 3 down. So, my starting position is 1 left, 3 down.

From there, I need to move to the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 2 up. That's a distance of 2 right and 5 up. But that's a lot, and there are walls in the way.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let me try to plot them on a grid.

Let's assume the origin (0,0) is where I start. Then:

- ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -3)
- ""is"" rule is at (0, -3)
- ""you"" rule is at (1, -3)

So, the rule ""baba is you"" is formed by these three blocks.

The walls are at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), (4,-3).

The key is at (8,2).

The ""stop"" rule is at (1,2).

So, to get to the ""stop"" block at (1,2), I need to move from (-1,-3) to (1,2). That's a distance of 2 right and 5 up. But the walls are at x=4, so I can move freely until x=4, but I can't go beyond because of the walls.

Wait, but if I can move up and right without hitting walls, maybe I can reach (1,2). Let me see:

From (-1,-3), moving right 2 steps would take me to (1,-3). Then, moving up 5 steps would take me to (1,2). But are there any walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls, they are at x=4, so from x=-1 to x=1, there are no walls. So, I can move right 2 steps to (1,-3), then up 5 steps to (1,2). That should be possible.

So, my first move is to move right twice and up five times. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I need to plan the sequence.

Wait, but the user can only choose one action each time. So, I need to decide the first step.

From (-1,-3), my first move could be right to (0,-3), then right again to (1,-3), then up five times.

But the user is asking for the first action, so I need to choose the first step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid something, but I don't see any immediate obstacles.

Wait, but the walls are at x=4, so moving right is safe until x=4.

So, the first action should be to move right to (0,-3).

But wait, the user's current position is where ""baba is you"" is, which is at (-1,-3). So, moving right once would take me to (0,-3), which is the position of the ""is"" rule. But I can't move through the ""is"" block because it's part of the rule. Or can I?

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move through rule blocks as long as they're not part of a rule. But in this case, the ""is"" block is part of the ""baba is you"" rule, so it's fixed. So, I can't move through it.

Wait, no, the ""is"" block is part of the rule, so it's immovable. So, I can't move into it. Therefore, I can't move right from (-1,-3) because the next cell to the right is (0,-3), which is the ""is"" block, part of the rule. So, I can't move right.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, I can't move right because the ""is"" block is in the way. So, I need to find another way.

Wait, maybe I can move up or down first. Let me see.

From (-1,-3), I can move up to (-1,-2), then right, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left, but that's into negative x, which might not have any walls, but I don't see any objects there.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at (-1,2). So, if I move up from (-1,-3) to (-1,-2), (-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (-1,2), I can reach the ""wall"" rule at (-1,2). But that's a long way up, and I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down, but that's into more negative y, which might not have anything.

Wait, perhaps I can move up to (-1,-2), then right to (0,-2), but I don't know if that's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to (-1,-2), then right to (0,-2), then up further.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can change the rule ""baba is you"" to something else. If I can move the ""you"" block, I can make myself into something else.

The ""you"" block is at (1,-3). If I can move it, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""you"" block to (1,-2), then the rule would be ""baba is [nothing]"", which might not make sense, but perhaps it would allow me to move differently.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""you"" block to another position, I can create a new rule like ""key is you"", making the key the player.

But how do I move the ""you"" block? It's at (1,-3). From my position at (-1,-3), I can't move right because the ""is"" block is in the way. So, I need to find another way to reach the ""you"" block.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. Let's see:

From (-1,-3), move up to (-1,-2). Then, can I move right? At (-1,-2), moving right would take me to (0,-2). Is there a wall there? The walls are at x=4, so no. So, I can move right to (0,-2), then right again to (1,-2), which is above the ""you"" block at (1,-3).

From (1,-2), I can move down to (1,-3), which is the ""you"" block. But can I move into it? Since it's part of the rule, I can't. So, I can't move into the ""you"" block.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to break the ""baba is you"" rule by moving one of its components.

If I can move the ""baba"" block, which is at (-1,-3), I can create a new rule. But I'm on that block, so I can't move it directly. Or can I?

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks by moving into them, but only if they're not part of a rule. Since ""baba is you"" is a rule, the blocks are fixed. So, I can't move them.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the key is at (8,2). To get there, I need to move right past the walls at x=4. But I can't because ""wall is stop"". So, I need to change that rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the ""wall"" block at (-1,2), the ""is"" block at (0,2), and the ""stop"" block at (1,2).","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means right now, the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, including 4 steps right and 3 up, which is right where the key is. So, I can't just walk straight to the key because the walls are blocking the path.

Hmm, maybe I can move some of the rule blocks to change the rules. There are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `key`"" at 7 steps right and 3 up, ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 3 up, and ""rule `win`"" at 9 steps right and 3 up. If I can move these, I might be able to create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes the walls passable.

Wait, the key is at 8 right and 2 up, but there's a wall at 4 right and 3 up. Maybe I can move the wall to somewhere else. But how? The walls are defined as ""stop"", so I can't move them unless I change that rule. If I can make walls not stop, then I can move through them.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 1 left and 2 up, and ""rule `stop`"" at 1 right and 2 up. If I can move these, I might be able to change the wall's property. For example, if I make ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" rule block away.

Another idea: if I can make the key not be the win condition anymore, maybe I can win by reaching something else. But the current win condition is ""key is win"", so I need to change that. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule block to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"", so that I just need to reach the end without needing the key.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think again. The key is at 8 right and 2 up, but there's a wall blocking the way. Maybe I can move the wall by changing its rule. If I can make the wall not stop, I can move through it. So, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

How can I do that? I can move the ""stop"" rule block away from the wall. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 2 up. If I move it somewhere else, the wall won't be stop anymore. But how do I move it? I can only move objects that aren't stop. Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you"", I can move Baba, but the ""stop"" rule is a text block, which I can move if it's not defined as stop.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a text block, so it's not a wall. So I can move it. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move towards the ""stop"" rule at 1 right and 2 up. Since I'm starting at the origin, I need to go right once and up twice. But wait, the initial position isn't given, but assuming I'm at (0,0), moving right once would take me to (1,0), then up twice to (1,2). But there's a wall at 4 right and 3 up, which is (4,3). So maybe I can move up first to get to (0,1), then right to (1,1), then up to (1,2).

Wait, but the walls are at 4 right and 3 up, which is (4,3), and others. So maybe the path is clear to reach (1,2). Let me check the objects:

- wall at 4 right and 3 up: (4,3)
- rule `key` at 7 right and 3 up: (7,3)
- rule `is` at 8 right and 3 up: (8,3)
- rule `win` at 9 right and 3 up: (9,3)
- rule `wall` at 1 left and 2 up: (-1,2)
- rule `is` at 2 up: (0,2)
- rule `stop` at 1 right and 2 up: (1,2)
- wall at 4 right and 2 up: (4,2)
- key at 8 right and 2 up: (8,2)
- wall at 4 right and 1 up: (4,1)
- ball at 5 right and 1 up: (5,1)
- rule `door` at 6 right and 1 up: (6,1)
- wall at 4 right: (4,0)
- wall at 4 right and 1 down: (4,-1)
- wall at 4 right and 2 down: (4,-2)
- rule `baba` at 1 left and 3 down: (-1,-3)
- rule `is` at 3 down: (0,-3)
- rule `you` at 1 right and 3 down: (1,-3)
- wall at 4 right and 3 down: (4,-3)

So, from (0,0), I can move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), then up to (1,2) where the ""stop"" rule is. So I can move there.

Once I'm at (1,2), I can pick up the ""stop"" rule block. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like down to (1,1), which is empty. Now, the ""stop"" rule is no longer associated with the wall, so the walls are no longer stop. That means I can move through them.

Now that walls are passable, I can go to the key. The key is at (8,2). So from (1,2), I can move right 7 times to (8,2), but wait, there are walls in the way. Wait, no, because I've made walls passable. So I can move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move right to (8,2) and pick up the key, which is the win condition. But wait, the key is at (8,2), but there's a wall at (4,2). Since walls are now passable, I can move through (4,2) to reach (8,2).

So the plan is:

1. Move up to (0,1)
2. Move right to (1,1)
3. Move up to (1,2) to pick up the ""stop"" rule
4. Move down to (1,1) to place it somewhere else, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule
5. Now, move right through the walls to reach the key at (8,2)
6. Once I pick up the key, I win.

Wait, but after step 4, I have the ""stop"" rule at (1,1). So the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken because the ""stop"" is no longer with the wall. So walls are now passable.

So, I can proceed to move right through the walls. Let me outline the exact steps:

From (0,0):
- up to (0,1)
- right to (1,1)
- up to (1,2) to get the ""stop"" rule
- down to (1,1) to place it
Now, walls are passable.

Then, from (1,1):
- right to (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) (but there's a wall at (4,1), but now it's passable)
- continue right to (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)
- up to (8,2) to get the key.

Wait, but the key is at (8,2). So from (8,1), I can move up to (8,2) and pick up the key, which is the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move right all the way from (1,1) to (8,1), then up to (8,2).

Yes, that should work. So the actions would be:

1. up
2. right
3. up
4. down
5. right x7
6. up

But since the assistant can only choose one action at a time, the first step is to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the key is the win condition, walls can't be moved through, and I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to figure out a path around them. Also, there are some rule blocks scattered around, which I can potentially move to change the rules.

Hmm, the key is the win condition, so I need to get to it. But the walls are blocking my path. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules and make the walls passable or turn something else into a win condition.

Let me check the rule blocks. There's a ""key"" rule 7 steps right and 2 up, ""is"" at 8 right and 2 up, ""win"" at 9 right and 2 up. Also, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 left and 1 up, ""is"" at 1 up, ""stop"" at 1 right and 1 up. So, if I can move these, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes walls not stop me.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I would become the key, which is the win condition. But how? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is"" or something. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""stop"" rule away or replacing it.

Looking at the positions, the ""stop"" rule is 1 right and 1 up. If I can move that somewhere else, maybe the walls won't stop me anymore. But how do I get there? I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. Let me see the other objects. There's a ball 5 steps right, which might be useful, but I'm not sure yet.

Another idea: if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is"", then ""baba is key"" would make me the key, which is the win condition. So I need to move the ""key"" rule block to where ""baba is"" is. But ""baba is you"" is the current rule, so maybe I can break that by moving the ""you"" rule.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 right and 4 down. If I move that, maybe I can change what ""baba is"" refers to. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is win"" so that I can win by getting the ball instead of the key. But the ball is at 5 right, which might be easier to reach.

Let me think about the layout. The walls are at 4 right and various up and down positions. So the path to the key is blocked by walls. If I can make the walls passable, I can go through them. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block away or replace it with something else.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's at 1 right and 1 up. If I can move that to a different position, maybe the walls won't stop me. But how do I move it? I need to be adjacent to it and push it. But I'm starting at a position where I can move up, right, etc.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Let me try moving up once. Then I can move right to get to the ""stop"" rule and push it somewhere else. If I push it down, maybe it won't affect the walls anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining other rule blocks. For example, if I can get ""wall is not stop"", then walls won't block me. To do that, I need to have ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""not stop"". But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Another approach: if I can make ""baba is key"", then I become the key, which is the win condition. So I just need to be on the key's position. But how do I move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is""?

The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 2 up. The ""baba is"" rule is at 1 left and 3 down. That's quite far apart. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule down to where ""baba is"" is. But that would require moving it past walls, which I can't do unless I change the rules first.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first to make walls passable. Let me try moving up once to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Then I can move right to reach it and push it down. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, walls won't block me anymore, and I can go through them to reach the key.

So, my plan is: move up to get closer to the ""stop"" rule, then move right to reach it, and push it down. Once that's done, the walls are passable, and I can go through them to reach the key and win.

Wait, but I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't break other things. If I move it, the ""wall is stop"" rule will still be active unless I change it. Maybe I need to break that rule by moving the ""stop"" rule away from ""wall is"".

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different property. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"", then I can push the walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work.

I think the best bet is to move the ""stop"" rule away so that walls no longer stop me. Let me try that. So, first, I'll move up to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move right to reach it and push it down. Once that's done, I can move through the walls to reach the key.

Wait, but I'm not sure if moving the ""stop"" rule will immediately make the walls passable. Maybe I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by separating the ""wall"" and ""stop"" rule blocks. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall is"" rule, then the rule ""wall is stop"" will be broken, and walls won't stop me anymore.

Yes, that makes sense. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block away from the ""wall is"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 1 up. The ""wall is"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule down, then the ""wall is stop"" rule will be broken, and walls won't stop me.

So, my steps are: move up once to get to the row where the ""stop"" rule is, then move right to reach it, and then push it down. Once that's done, I can move through the walls to reach the key.

Let me try that. I'll move up once, then right once to reach the ""stop"" rule, and then down once to push it down. Now, the ""stop"" rule is no longer adjacent to ""wall is"", so the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken. Now, walls won't stop me, and I can move through them.

With that done, I can now move right through the walls to reach the key. The key is at 8 right and 1 up. So, I'll move right multiple times, going through the walls, and then up once to reach the key. Once I'm on the key, since ""key is win"", I win the level.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I can actually move through the walls. Let me confirm. After breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, walls should no longer block me. So, I can move right through them.

Yes, that should work. So, the plan is: move up, right, down to push the ""stop"" rule away, then move right through the walls to reach the key and win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 8 steps to the right. But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4 steps right and various steps up and down. So, I can't just move straight right because of the walls blocking the path. 

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. Maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Let me check the rule blocks. There are several rule pieces scattered around. 

I see a ""wall"" rule at 1 step left. If I can move that, maybe I can change what walls do. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule next to it. If I can make walls not stop me, that would help. 

Wait, the current rule is ""wall is stop,"" which makes walls immovable. If I can break that rule, maybe the walls won't block me anymore. How can I do that? I need to move the ""is"" or ""stop"" blocks to break the rule. 

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" block is 1 step up, and the ""stop"" is 1 step right. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Then walls wouldn't stop me, allowing me to pass through them. 

But how do I get to the ""stop"" block? It's 1 step right from the ""wall"" rule. I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. I need to move right to reach it. But the walls are in the way. Hmm, maybe I can move up or down to get around. 

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and various steps up and down. If I move up or down, I might be able to bypass them. Let me try moving up first. If I go up, I can maybe reach the ""is"" block that's 1 step up. But I'm not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule. The key is 8 steps right, but if I can make the key not the win condition, maybe I can win another way. But that might complicate things. 

I think the best approach is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move either the ""wall,"" ""is,"" or ""stop"" blocks. The ""stop"" block is 1 step right, so if I can move right, I can grab it. But the walls are blocking the way. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block that's 1 step up. If I move it somewhere else, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Let me try moving up to get to that ""is"" block. 

So, I'll move up once to reach the ""is"" block. Then, I can move it somewhere else, breaking the rule. Once the rule is broken, walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the key. 

But wait, after moving the ""is"" block, I need to make sure I can still win. The key is still the win condition, so once I reach it, I can win. 

So, the plan is: move up to get the ""is"" block, move it away, break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then move right through the walls to get the key. 

Let me check the positions again. The ""is"" block is 1 step up. So, moving up once should get me there. Then, I can move it down or somewhere else. 

I think that's the way to go. So, the first action should be to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 8 steps to the right. There are also walls and some rule blocks. The walls are in various positions, but I need to figure out how to get to the key. 

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks to change the rules. The key is 8 steps to the right, but there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can break through the walls by changing the rules. 

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active, which means walls block movement. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, maybe I can pass through. Let me check where the ""stop"" rule is. It's 1 step to the right. So if I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls passable. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into something else to bypass the walls. But since ""baba is you,"" I can only move Baba. Hmm. 

Another idea: if I can create a new rule that makes the key something else, but that might not help. Or maybe I can make the key into a different object. 

Wait, the key is 8 steps to the right. There's also a ball 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe the ball can be used somehow. But I'm not sure how. 

Let me think about the rule blocks. There are several ""is"" rules. If I can rearrange them, maybe I can create a new rule that helps. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could become the key and win. But how? 

I need to move the rule blocks. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move these to form a new rule, like ""baba is key,"" that might work. 

But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule. It's 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls not stop by moving the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the walls won't block me. 

Let me try to plan the steps. First, I need to get to the ""stop"" rule. It's 1 step to the right. So I can move right once to get there. Then, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else, like down or left, so the walls no longer have the stop property. 

Once the walls are passable, I can move through them to reach the key. 

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move through non-stop objects. So if I remove the stop from walls, I can walk through them. 

So the plan is: move right to get the ""stop"" rule, then move it somewhere else, then go through the walls to reach the key. 

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to pick it up and move it. So first, move right to the ""stop"" rule, then move it down or left. 

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move right to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move down to place it somewhere else, making walls passable.
3. Move through the walls to reach the key.

But wait, the key is 8 steps to the right. There are walls in the way, so I need to go around or through them. If I make the walls passable, I can go through. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key closer. But the key is an object, not a rule, so I can't change its position directly. 

Another thought: if I can make the ball into a win condition, but that might not help. 

I think the best approach is to make the walls passable by moving the ""stop"" rule. So I'll move right to get the ""stop"" rule, then move it down. 

Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right. So from my current position, I can move right once to get it. Then, I can move down to place it somewhere else. 

Once I've moved the ""stop"" rule, the walls will no longer stop me. Then I can move right through the walls to reach the key. 

So the actions would be:

1. right (to get the ""stop"" rule)
2. down (to place it somewhere else)
3. right (to move through the wall)
4. right (continue moving right towards the key)
5. ... and so on until I reach the key.

But I need to make sure that after moving the ""stop"" rule, the walls are passable. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the walls are at 4 steps to the right and various steps up and down. So if I can move through them, I can reach the key. 

I think this is the way to go. So the first action is to move right to get the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 7 steps to the right. I need to get to that key to win. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some up and some down. I also see some rule blocks that I can potentially move to change the rules.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" isn't active anymore. Oh, no, actually, in the active rules, it's only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So maybe the walls aren't stopping me? Or are they? I need to check the objects again.

The walls are placed at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, and others are down. If ""wall is stop"" isn't active, then maybe I can walk through them. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

I can move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can make walls stop me. But right now, I don't see ""wall is stop"" as an active rule, so maybe walls don't stop me. That would make it easier to get to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. But since ""key is win"" is active, I just need to get the key. 

So, my goal is to move right to reach the key. Let me see the path. The key is 7 steps to the right. Are there any walls blocking me? The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 up, but if I go straight right, maybe I can avoid them. Or perhaps I can move down to go around.

Wait, the ball is at 4 steps right and 1 down. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure. The door rule is at 5 steps right and 1 down. Maybe if I can make the door open, but I don't see a door object.

I think the best approach is to move right as much as possible. Let me try moving right step by step. Each time I move right, I get closer to the key. If I can get past any walls, I can reach the key.

So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""key"" is five steps to the right and one step up, ""is"" is six steps to the right and one step up, and ""win"" is seven steps to the right and one step up. There's also a ""wall"" rule three steps to the left, and ""stop"" one step to the right. 

I see a key six steps to the right, which is the win condition. There's a ball three steps to the right and one step down, and a door rule four steps to the right and one step down. Walls are blocking the way down, but maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules.

I need to get to the key to win. The walls are in the way, but if I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to change the rules so that the walls aren't stopping me. 

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule isn't active anymore. Oh, no, actually, the active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So walls are just objects unless defined otherwise. But in the objects list, there are walls, so maybe they are blocking movement unless I change their properties.

I think I need to move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop me or not. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, then that wall becomes impenetrable. But I want to get past the walls, so maybe I should remove the ""stop"" property from the walls. 

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition, but that might complicate things. My goal is to reach the key, so maybe I should focus on moving the rule blocks to create a path.

Looking at the rule blocks, I can move them to form new rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" block next to the ""win"" block, I can create a new rule like ""something is win."" But I need to think about how that affects the game.

Wait, the key is six steps to the right. If I can move the ""key"" rule block to the left, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the key something else, but that might not help me reach it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. If I move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, that wall becomes stop, meaning I can't move through it. But I want to get past the walls, so maybe I should remove the ""stop"" from the walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I move it away, the walls might no longer be stop. So, if I move the ""stop"" rule block somewhere else, the walls would lose their stop property, making them passable.

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule block away from the walls. Let me see where I can move it. If I move it down or to the side, away from the walls, then the walls won't be stop anymore, and I can walk through them.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule block? I need to move it by taking steps. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. So, if I move right, I can reach it and then move it somewhere else.

Wait, but if I move right, I might hit a wall. Let me check the map again. The walls are two steps to the right and one step up, and other walls are blocking the way. So, maybe I need to move up first to get around.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule that changes the properties of the walls. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then the walls become controllable, but that might not help me pass through them.

Hmm, maybe a better approach is to move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location so that the walls are no longer stop. That way, I can walk through them to reach the key.

So, I'll try to move the ""stop"" rule block. Since it's one step to the right, I can move right to pick it up and then move it somewhere else, like down or left.

Wait, but if I move right, I might be blocked by a wall. Let me see: the wall is two steps to the right and one step up. So, if I move right once, I'm at position (1,0). Then, moving right again would take me to (2,0), but there's a wall at (2,1). So, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall.

Alternatively, I can move up to get to the rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is two steps to the left and one step up. So, if I move up, I can reach the rule blocks and maybe rearrange them.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the key is six steps to the right. There are walls blocking the way, but if I can change the rules, I can pass through them.

I think the best course of action is to move the ""stop"" rule block away from the walls. So, I'll move right to reach the ""stop"" rule and then move it down or left to a position where it's not affecting the walls.

So, my first move is to move right to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it somewhere else to make the walls passable.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall one step to the right and one step up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""key"" is four steps to the right and one step up, ""is"" is five steps to the right and one step up, and ""win"" is six steps to the right and one step up. There's also a ""wall"" rule four steps to the left and one step up, and ""stop"" is one step to the right. 

The key is five steps to the right. There's a ball two steps to the right and one step down, and a door rule three steps to the right and one step down. Walls are also present at various positions down. 

I think the goal is to get to the key, which is the win condition. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me. 

How can I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule and ""stop"" rule to form a new rule. The ""wall"" rule is four steps to the left and one step up, and ""stop"" is one step to the right. If I can move them next to each other, maybe I can create ""wall is stop"" or change it. 

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me see the positions. The ""wall"" rule is four steps left and one up, and ""stop"" is one right. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can place ""wall"" next to ""not stop,"" that would make walls passable. 

I'm a bit confused about how to move the rule blocks. I think I need to move them adjacent to each other to form a new rule. So, if I can get ""wall"" next to ""is"" and then ""not stop,"" that would change the rule. 

Let me try to plan the steps. First, I need to move towards the rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is five steps to the right and one up. The ""wall"" rule is four steps left and one up. Maybe I can move left to get to the ""wall"" rule and then move it next to ""is."" 

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can only move in the four directions. Let me see the layout. The key is five steps to the right, but there are walls blocking the way. If I can change the wall rules, I can pass through. 

Another idea: maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so I become the key and win immediately. But I'm not sure how to do that. 

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""key is win,"" which is already active. Maybe that's not helpful. 

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on making walls passable. If I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through walls. 

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule and ""not stop"" rule together. But I don't see a ""not"" rule. Maybe I can break an existing rule. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I can move it next to ""wall,"" I can form ""wall is stop,"" but that's the current rule. I need to negate it. 

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, ""wall is not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" block. Maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving it away. 

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. If I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I'm not sure. 

Let me try to move towards the ""wall"" rule. It's four steps left and one up. So I need to move left four times and up once. But there are walls in the way. 

Wait, the wall is one step to the right and one step up. So if I move right once and up once, I hit a wall. That's blocking me. 

Maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall. Let me try moving up. 

After moving up, I can then move left. But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated. 

Perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ball. The ball is two steps to the right and one step down. Maybe I can use the ball to break something. 

But I'm not sure how. Maybe if I can move the ball into a rule block, it can change the rules. 

Alternatively, the door rule is three steps to the right and one step down. Maybe if I can open the door, I can reach the key. 

But the door is probably blocked by walls. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is something."" 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is six steps to the right and one step up. If I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule. 

But I'm not sure what that would do. 

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to reinforce the current rule. 

I think I need to focus on making walls passable. Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule and ""stop"" rule to create ""wall is not stop."" 

But I don't see a ""not"" block. Maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving it away. 

If I move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule, then walls won't stop me. 

So, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I can move it somewhere else, like down, then walls won't be stop anymore. 

How can I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move next to it and then move it. 

The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. So if I move right once, I can be next to it. Then I can move it down. 

Let me try that. 

First, move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down. 

After moving the ""stop"" rule down, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, so walls are no longer stop. 

Then I can move through the walls to reach the key. 

So the steps would be: move right, then move the ""stop"" rule down. 

But I need to make sure I can do that without getting blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule away. 

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is four steps left and one up. If I can move it somewhere else, the walls might change. 

But I'm not sure. 

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule. 

So, first, move right to be next to the ""stop"" rule. Then move it down. 

Once ""stop"" is moved, walls are no longer stop, so I can pass through them. 

Then I can move right to reach the key. 

So the actions would be: right, then down. 

But I need to make sure I can do that. 

Wait, after moving right, I'm next to the ""stop"" rule. Then I can move it down. 

Yes, that should work. 

So the first action is to move right. 

Then, in the next step, move the ""stop"" rule down. 

But in this step, I can only choose one action. 

So I'll choose to move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule. 

Then, in the next step, I can move it down. 

But the user is asking for one action now. 

So I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a bunch of walls, a key, a ball, a door, and some rule blocks. The key is 4 steps to the right, so that's probably where I need to go. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some up and some down. 

I notice that the rule blocks are spread out. There's a ""rule `is`"" 4 steps to the left and 1 step up, and others like ""rule `key`"" and ""rule `win`"" to the right. Maybe I can move these rule blocks to change the rules. 

Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The walls are defined as ""stop,"" so they block movement. But if I can change the rules, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. 

I see a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the right. If I can move that, perhaps I can redefine what stops movement. Maybe if I make ""wall is not stop,"" I can walk through walls. 

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule like ""ball is you"" to control the ball, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the key, which is 4 steps to the right. But there are walls in the way. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to pass through them. 

I should move towards the ""rule `stop`"" block. It's 1 step to the right, so I can move right once to reach it. Then, maybe I can move it somewhere else or combine it with another rule block to change the rules. 

Wait, but I can only move one block at a time. So I need to plan carefully. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to a position where it's not affecting the walls anymore. 

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule block to redefine walls. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" that would allow me to pass through them. 

Let me check the positions again. The ""rule `wall`"" is 5 steps to the left. That's a bit far, but maybe I can get there eventually. 

But first, I need to get past the immediate walls. The key is 4 steps to the right, but there are walls blocking that path. If I can make the walls not stop me, I can reach the key. 

So, my plan is to move right to get closer to the ""rule `stop`"" block and then manipulate it to change the rules. 

I think moving right is the best first step to get closer to the rule blocks I need to change.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key three steps to the right. My goal is to get to the key to win. But I need to figure out how to move there without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

First, I should check the walls. There's a wall one step to the left and one step up, which might be above me. Another wall is one step to the left, so that's directly to my left. There's also a wall one step to the left and one step down, which is below me to the left. So, I'm probably surrounded by walls on the left side, making it difficult to move left.

The key is three steps to the right, so I need to move right. But I should check if there are any walls blocking my path to the right. The objects on the map don't mention walls directly to the right, except for some that are further down or up. So, maybe the path to the right is clear.

Wait, there's a rule `stop` one step to the right. That means whatever is one step to the right is a stop block, which I can't move through. So, if I try to move right, I might hit a stop block. That's a problem because I can't move through stop blocks.

Hmm, maybe I can change the rules to make the stop block passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else or change it, I might be able to move right. But how?

Looking at the other rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" five steps to the left and five steps down. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. If I can make ""stop is you"" or something, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I can move that, I can change what's considered a stop block. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make the key something else, but that might not help me reach it. Or perhaps I can make the key into a different object.

Wait, another approach: if I can make myself into a different object that can pass through stop blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass"" or something, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Looking again, the objects include a ball one step down. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. If I can make the ball into a win condition or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is one step down. If I can move the ball to the key's position, maybe I can trigger a win. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule. There's a rule `door` one step to the right and one step down. If I can make the door into something else, maybe I can open it.

Wait, but I'm not sure how doors work in this context. Maybe doors require keys, but I already have the key as the win condition.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the key is three steps to the right. There's a stop block one step to the right, which is blocking me. So, I can't move right because of the stop block.

What if I move up or down to bypass the stop block? Let me check the walls. There's a wall one step to the left and one step up, so moving up might not be possible. Moving down, there's a wall one step to the left and one step down, but maybe I can move down to the right.

Wait, the ball is one step down. If I move down, I can get to the ball. Maybe the ball can help me somehow. If I can make the ball into a key or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then I can move through stop blocks. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is five steps to the left and five steps down. That's far away. Maybe I can move it closer. But I can only move text blocks that are not defined as stop. So, I can move the ""is"" rule because it's just text.

If I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""stop is you,"" which would make stop blocks passable. That way, I can move through the stop block to the right.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" rule to the position of the ""stop"" rule, creating ""stop is you."" Then, I can move right through the stop block to reach the key.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is five steps to the left and five steps down. I need to move it up five steps and right five steps to get it next to the ""stop"" rule, which is one step to the right.

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a quicker way. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule instead. If I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, then the block that was a stop block is no longer a stop block.

But I can't move the ""stop"" rule because it's defined as a stop block. Or can I? Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right, which is a text block. So, I can move it as long as it's not defined as stop. But since it's the ""stop"" rule, moving it might change its property.

Wait, no, the ""stop"" rule is a text block, so I can move it. So, if I move the ""stop"" rule away, then the block that was a stop block is no longer a stop block, allowing me to move through.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right to somewhere else, making the block passable. Then, I can move right to the key.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Let me see, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. So, I can move right, but that's blocked by the stop block. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I can move up or down to get around. Let me check the walls. There's a wall one step to the left and one step up, so moving up is blocked. Moving down, there's a wall one step to the left and one step down, but maybe I can move down to the right.

Wait, the ball is one step down. If I move down, I can get to the ball. Maybe the ball can help me move the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can move it down, maybe I can make the key into something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it, I can pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ""stop"" rule into something else. For example, if I can make ""stop is win,"" but that might not help.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is stop,"" then I can move through stop blocks because I'm a stop block. But that might not work because stop blocks can't move.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to break the ""stop"" rule by moving it. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right. But I can't move right because it's blocked. So, maybe I need to move down first.

If I move down, I can get to the ball. Then, maybe I can move the ball to the ""stop"" rule's position, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is one step down. If I move down, I can get to the ball. Then, maybe I can push the ball to the right, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" rule is one step to the right and one step down. If I can make the door into something else, maybe I can open it.

Wait, but I'm not sure how doors work here. Maybe doors require keys, but the key is the win condition.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move right and see what happens. If I try to move right, I hit the stop block. So, I can't move right. Therefore, I need to find another way.

Wait, maybe I can move up or down to bypass the stop block. Let me check the walls. There's a wall one step to the left and one step up, so moving up is blocked. Moving down, there's a wall one step to the left and one step down, but maybe I can move down to the right.

Wait, the ball is one step down. If I move down, I can get to the ball. Then, maybe I can move the ball to the right, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is five steps to the left and five steps down. That's far away, but maybe I can move it closer.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule would take a lot of steps. Maybe there's a quicker way.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the key into a different object, like a door, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into a win condition by moving the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is four steps to the right and one step up. If I can move it next to the key, then the key becomes the win condition, but that's already the case.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So, the key is already the win condition. I just need to reach it.

So, the main problem is the stop block one step to the right. I need to find a way to move past it.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule one step to the right, making the block passable. But I can't move right because it's blocked. So, maybe I need to move down first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall to the left and up, some rules scattered around, a key, a ball, a door, and more walls. The key is three steps to the right, which is probably where I need to go to win. But there are walls blocking the way, so I need to figure out how to get around them.

I remember that in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks to change the rules. Maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. Let me check the rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule six steps to the left, which probably defines walls as stop. If I can move that, maybe I can make walls not stop me.

Wait, but I can only move objects that aren't defined as stop. Since walls are stop, I can't move them directly. Hmm, maybe I can change the rule so that walls aren't stop anymore. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I could attach it to something else or remove it from walls.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's one step to the right. If I move it, maybe I can make walls not stop. But how? I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""wall is not stop."" But to do that, I need to have the ""is"" and ""not"" and ""stop"" blocks nearby.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" five steps to the left and five steps down. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. If I can get the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" that could change the wall's properties.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe a simpler way is to move the key closer. The key is three steps to the right. If I can move the key to a position where it's not blocked by walls, I can reach it. But the key is an object, and I can only move rule blocks, not objects directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make something else the win condition, like the door or the ball, that might be easier. But the current win condition is the key, so I need to get to the key.

Let me think about the movement. I'm Baba, so I can move around unless blocked by walls. The walls are to the left and down, so maybe I can go around them. But the key is to the right, and there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to create a path.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule one step to the right and one step down. Doors usually require keys to open, but if I can change the rules, maybe I can make the door open without a key or make it passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball, then touching the ball would win the level. But I need to move the ""win"" rule, which is four steps to the right and one step up. That might be possible if I can get there.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to plan step by step. First, I need to get to the key. The key is three steps to the right. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the wall rules to make the walls passable.

I can try moving the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it away from the walls, then walls won't stop me. So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule, which is one step to the right. If I move it down or somewhere else, the walls might no longer be stop.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and then move it. So, I should move towards the ""stop"" rule. It's one step to the right, so I can move right to get next to it.

Once I'm next to the ""stop"" rule, I can move it down or somewhere else, which would change the rule. If I move it down, it might not be connected to the wall anymore, so walls won't be stop.

After that, I can move through the walls to reach the key. So, the plan is: move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule, then move it down to break the rule, making walls passable. Then, move right to reach the key and win.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can only move one step at a time. Let me check the exact positions. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. So, I can move right to be next to it, then move it down. That should work.

Alternatively, if moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't work, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is six steps to the left. If I can move it to change the wall's properties, that might help.

But moving the ""stop"" rule seems more straightforward. Let me try that. So, first, move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule. Then, move it down. That should make walls not stop me.

Once the walls are passable, I can move right through them to reach the key. Then, I can move right to the key and win the level.

I think that's the best course of action. So, the first step is to move right to get next to the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key two steps to the right. There's also a ball one step to the left and one step down. The door is directly below me. There are walls all around, which are stop, so I can't go through them. 

I need to get the key to win. But how? The door is in the way. Maybe I can move the door or change the rules to make the door passable. 

Wait, the door is a rule. If I can move the door's rule, maybe I can change its property. The door is currently a rule, but if I move it next to another word, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the door next to ""is"" and ""open,"" it would become ""door is open,"" making it passable. 

But I don't see an ""open"" rule here. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing rules. If I move the ""is"" rule away from the door, it might stop being a door. 

Let me think about the steps. I'm currently at the starting position. The door is directly below me. If I move down, I can't because the door is a stop. So I need to change the door's property. 

I can try moving the ""is"" rule next to the door. If I move the ""is"" rule down, it would be next to the door, making ""door is [something]."" But I need to create a new rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" or ""stop"" to change the door's property. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to change the win condition. But the key is already the win condition. 

Wait, the ball is one step to the left and one step down. Maybe I can use the ball to help. If I can make the ball move, it might break through a wall or something. But I'm not sure how. 

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule down to the door. If I move the ""is"" rule down, it would be next to the door, creating ""door is [something]."" But I need to have another word to complete the rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to it. 

The ""stop"" rule is one step to the right. If I move the ""is"" rule down to the door, and then move the ""stop"" rule next to it, it would make ""door is stop,"" which would make the door a stop, but that's not helpful. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door. The ""win"" rule is three steps to the right and one step up. If I move the ""is"" rule to the door, and then move the ""win"" rule next to it, it would make ""door is win,"" which would make the door the win condition. But I already have the key as the win condition. 

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule down to the door. That would create ""door is [something]."" But without another word, it's just ""door is,"" which doesn't do anything. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the door. The ""key"" rule is one step to the right and one step up. If I move the ""key"" rule down to the door, it would make ""door is key,"" which would make the door a key. But I'm not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is seven steps to the left and five steps down. If I move it up, I can make ""baba is [something]."" But I'm not sure. 

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule down to the door and see what happens. If I move the ""is"" rule down, it would be next to the door, and then I can move another rule next to it to create a new rule. 

So, first, I'll move the ""is"" rule down. That would be the action ""down."" Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The walls are marked as stop, so I can't move through them. There's also a ball and a door, but I'm not sure what they do yet. 

I see that the key is two steps to the right and one step up from my current position. So, I need to figure out how to get there. The path seems blocked by walls, but maybe I can move some text blocks to change the rules. 

Wait, there are rule blocks like ""is,"" ""key,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" If I can rearrange these, I might be able to change the rules to make the walls passable or make the key reachable. 

For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, they might no longer block me. Or maybe I can make the door into something else. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. 

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the key, but walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different object, making the walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. 

I also notice the ball is nearby. Maybe it can be used to push something or change a rule. But I'm not sure how. 

Another idea: if I can make the door into a ""win"" condition, maybe I can bypass the key. But the current rule is ""key is win,"" so that might not help. 

Wait, if I can move the ""key"" rule to another object, maybe I can make something else the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls so I can pass through them. Let me see how to do that. I need to move the ""stop"" rule block to a different location, perhaps near the door or the ball. 

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move them if they're not defined as ""stop."" Since the walls are ""stop,"" I can't move them, but the rule blocks themselves aren't walls, so I should be able to move them. 

So, I'll try to move the ""stop"" rule block to a different position, maybe next to the door. That way, the walls will no longer be stop, and I can move through them. 

Alternatively, I could move the ""wall"" rule to make something else a wall, but that might complicate things. 

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule to the door. If I can do that, the door becomes stop, and the walls are no longer stop. Then I can move through the walls to reach the key. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should test it. 

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to the door, the door becomes stop, which might block me, but the walls would no longer be stop, so I can pass through them. That seems promising. 

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule block to the door, making the door stop, and then move through the walls to reach the key. 

But how do I execute that? I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. Let me see where it is. It's one step to the right and one step up. I need to move it to the door, which is one step down. 

So, I'll move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule and then move it to the door's position. 

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move in the four directions. Let me check the positions again. 

The ""stop"" rule is at (1 right, 1 up). The door is at (1 down). So, I need to move down from my current position to reach the door. 

But there's a wall in the way. Unless I can move the wall first. Hmm, this is getting complicated. 

Maybe I should try a different approach. Instead of moving the ""stop"" rule, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to make something else the win condition. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" or ""you"" rules to change my properties. But I'm not sure how that would help. 

Wait, if I can make the ball into a ""win"" condition, then maybe I can win by reaching the ball instead of the key. But the current rule is ""key is win,"" so that might not work. 

I think the best bet is to try to move the ""stop"" rule to the door, making the door stop, and then move through the walls to reach the key. 

So, I'll move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule and then move it to the door's position. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule instead. 

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to make the ball the win condition. That way, I can reach the ball instead of the key. 

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think again. 

The key is two steps to the right and one step up. There are walls blocking the way. If I can make the walls passable, I can reach the key. 

So, moving the ""stop"" rule from the walls would achieve that. 

I think I'll proceed with that plan. I'll move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule and then move it to the door. 

Wait, but the door is already a rule block. Maybe I can make the door into a stop, which would block me, but the walls would no longer be stop. 

Alternatively, I could move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, like next to the ball. 

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule to the door and see what happens. 

So, my action will be to move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule. 

But wait, I'm not sure if I can move the ""stop"" rule directly. Maybe I need to move it in steps. 

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule to make something else a wall, but that might not help. 

I think I'll try moving the ""stop"" rule to the door. 

So, I'll move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule and then move it to the door's position. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try a different approach. 

Wait, if I can make the door into a ""win"" condition, then I can win by reaching the door instead of the key. But the current rule is ""key is win,"" so that might not work. 

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to make the door the win condition. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. 

I think the best course of action is to move the ""stop"" rule to the door, making the door stop, and then move through the walls to reach the key. 

So, I'll move down to pick up the ""stop"" rule and then move it to the door's position. 

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule instead.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the left and two steps up. There are also some rule blocks: ""is"" six steps to the left and two steps up, ""key"" one step to the right and two steps up, another ""is"" two steps to the right and two steps up, and ""win"" three steps to the right and two steps up. 

Wait, there's also a ""wall"" rule seven steps to the left and one step up, and a ""stop"" rule one step to the right and one step up. The key is two steps to the right and one step up. There's a ball one step to the left, and some walls and other rule blocks below that. 

Hmm, so I need to get to the key to win. But the walls are blocking my way. The walls are defined as ""stop,"" so I can't move through them. I need to find a way to change the rules so that I can move past the walls or make the walls not stop me. 

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""is"" and ""win"" nearby. Maybe I can rearrange these to create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I might be able to change the wall's property. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me anymore. 

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to get Baba next to it. Let me see the positions. The ""is"" block is six steps to the left and two steps up. I'm currently at the starting position, which I think is the origin (0,0). So to get to the ""is"" block, I need to move left six times and up two times. But there are walls in the way. 

Wait, maybe I can move around the walls. Let me check the layout again. There's a wall two steps to the left and two steps up. So if I go up first, maybe I can bypass the wall. Let me try moving up two steps first. 

After moving up two steps, I'm at (0,2). Now, I can move left six steps. But there's a wall two steps to the left at (2,2). So moving left from (0,2) would hit the wall at (-2,2). That's a problem. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first. If I move down, I can avoid the wall. Let me try moving down one step to (0,-1). Then, I can move left six steps to (-6,-1). But I'm not sure if that helps because the ""is"" block is at (-6,2). 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the rules again. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The key is two steps to the right and one step up, which is at (2,1). But there's a wall at (2,2), so maybe I can go around it. 

If I move right two steps to (2,0), then up one step to (2,1), but there's a wall at (2,2), so I can't go up from (2,0) because the wall is blocking. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to (0,1), then right two steps to (2,1). But again, the wall at (2,2) might block my path. 

Wait, maybe I can break the wall by changing the rules. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through the walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""not stop."" But I don't see a ""not"" block. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and another property. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to ""wall"" to change it. If I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is not stop,"" that would help. But I'm not sure how to do that without a ""not"" block. 

Wait, maybe I can just move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and another property to overwrite the rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""win,"" it would make ""wall is win,"" which might not help. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block next to ""is"" and ""win"" to change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to change the wall's property. Let me try to plan the steps. 

First, I need to get Baba next to the ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at (-6,2). So I need to move left six steps and up two steps. But there are walls in the way. 

Wait, maybe I can move down first to avoid the walls. Let me try moving down to (0,-1), then left six steps to (-6,-1). Then up three steps to (-6,2). That might work. 

So the steps would be: down, down, down, left, left, left, left, left, left, up, up, up. But that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it's the most efficient. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to (0,1), then left six steps to (-6,1), then up one step to (-6,2). That might be better. 

Once I'm at (-6,2), I can move the ""is"" block. But how? I think I can pick up the ""is"" block and move it next to ""wall"" and another property. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the position of ""wall"" and ""stop"" to change the rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" it would make ""wall is stop,"" which is the current rule. That doesn't help. 

Hmm, maybe I need to create a new rule. If I can move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" block. 

Wait, maybe I can use the ""key"" block. If I move ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win,"" it would make ""key is win,"" which is already the case. 

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ball. The ball is at (-1, -1). Maybe I can use it somehow. 

Wait, the ball is at (-1,-1). If I can move the ball to the key, maybe it can help. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" block. The ""door"" rule is at (1,-1). If I can make ""door is open,"" but I don't see an ""open"" block. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to see if it changes anything. 

Wait, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" it would make ""wall is stop,"" which is the current rule. That doesn't help. 

Maybe I need to break the rule by moving ""stop"" away from ""wall."" If I can move ""stop"" somewhere else, then ""wall"" would no longer be ""stop."" 

The ""stop"" rule is at (1,1). If I can move it away, maybe to (1,2), then ""wall"" would no longer be ""stop."" 

But how do I move ""stop""? I need to get Baba next to it. Let me see. The ""stop"" block is at (1,1). So I can move right one step to (1,0), then up one step to (1,1). 

Once I'm at (1,1), I can pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, like (1,2). That would make ""wall is"" without ""stop,"" which might change the rule. 

Wait, but moving ""stop"" would break the rule ""wall is stop,"" so walls would no longer stop me. That could help me move through walls. 

So the plan is: move to (1,1), pick up ""stop,"" move it to (1,2). Then, walls won't stop me anymore. 

But how do I get to (1,1)? Let me check the path. From (0,0), I can move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1). But is there a wall blocking that path? 

Looking back, the wall is at (2,2), so moving right to (1,0) is clear. Then up to (1,1) is also clear. 

So the steps would be: right, up. Then, pick up ""stop"" and move up again to (1,2). 

After that, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, so walls won't block me. Then I can move through walls to reach the key. 

Wait, but the key is at (2,1). If I can move through walls, I can go up to (2,2), which is a wall, but now it's not stopping me. Then I can move down to (2,1) to get the key. 

So the full plan is: 

1. Move right to (1,0). 
2. Move up to (1,1) to pick up ""stop."" 
3. Move up to (1,2) to place ""stop"" there. 
4. Now, walls are no longer stop. 
5. Move right to (2,2), which is a wall but now passable. 
6. Move down to (2,1) to get the key and win. 

I think that should work. Let me try it step by step. 

First, move right to (1,0). Then up to (1,1). Then up to (1,2). Now, walls are passable. Move right to (2,2), then down to (2,1) to win. 

I hope this works. Let's see.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a bunch of walls, some rules, a key, a ball, and a door. The walls are all around, which probably means they're blocking my path. The key is somewhere, and I need to get to it to win. 

Wait, the key is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So if I can move right and up, I can reach it. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. Let me see: there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. Hmm, that's not directly in my way if I'm moving right. 

Also, there's a door at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Doors usually require a key to open, but since the key is the win condition, maybe I don't need to worry about that right now. 

I think the best move is to go towards the key. Since I'm Baba, I can move right and up. Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I can get closer to the key. Then, moving up should get me to the key. 

Wait, but there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up. That might be a problem if I go too far up. Maybe I should just move right once to get closer. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to see if there's a clearer path. But the key is to the right and up, so moving right seems more direct. 

I think moving right is the best first step. That way, I can get closer to the key without immediately hitting a wall. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The key is currently at 1 step up, which is directly above me. But wait, there's a wall in the way. The walls are defined as ""stop,"" so they can't be moved through. 

I see that there are some rule blocks around. There's a ""rule `is`"" block 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up, and another ""rule `is`"" block 2 steps up. Maybe I can move these to create a new rule. If I can rearrange the rules, I might be able to change the properties of objects or myself to bypass the wall.

Let me think about how to move these blocks. If I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""key"" block, I could create a new rule like ""key is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" so that I can pick up the key as myself. 

Wait, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key, and since the key is the win condition, maybe that would let me win. But how do I move the blocks to create that rule? I need to get the ""is"" block next to the ""key"" block and the ""baba"" block.

Looking at the positions, the ""key"" is 1 step up, and the ""is"" blocks are a bit further away. I might need to move the ""is"" block closer. Let me see, the ""is"" block is 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I move it to the right, I can bring it closer to the ""key"" and ""baba.""

But moving the ""is"" block requires me to be adjacent to it. I'm currently at the starting position, so I need to navigate towards it. Let me plan my steps. I'll move left a few times to reach the ""is"" block, then move it up or down as needed.

Wait, but there are walls blocking my path. The walls are at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps up, and other positions. I can't move through walls, so I need to find a way around. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the walls not stop me. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""not"" block, so that might not be possible. 

Hmm, perhaps I should focus on getting the ""key"" block next to the ""is"" block. If I can move the ""key"" block to the left, I can create a new rule. But the ""key"" is currently at 1 step up, and I can't move it directly because it's a rule block. 

Wait, no, the ""key"" is an object, not a rule block. So I can move it. Let me see, the ""key"" is 1 step up. If I move up, I can grab it. But there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the wall first. 

But walls are ""stop,"" so I can't move them. Unless I change the rule. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can move through them. But again, I don't have a ""not"" block. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I move it away, the walls might no longer stop me. Let me try that. 

I need to move the ""stop"" block. It's 1 step to the left and 1 step up. I can move left and up to reach it, then move it somewhere else. But I'm blocked by walls. Maybe I can move around the walls. 

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps up, so if I move left 4 times and up 2, I can get past them. But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me think differently. The key is the win condition, so if I can make myself the key, I can win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is key."" I have the ""baba"" rule block 9 steps to the left and 4 steps down. That's far away. Maybe I can move it up.

Alternatively, I can move the ""key"" block down to where I am. The ""key"" is 1 step up, so if I move up, I can grab it. But the wall is in the way. Maybe I can break the wall by changing the rule.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, then the walls won't stop me. Let me try moving the ""stop"" block. It's 1 step to the left and 1 step up. I can move left and up to reach it, then move it somewhere else. 

So, I'll move left once, then up once to get to the ""stop"" block. Then, I'll move it down or right to disable it. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't stop me anymore, and I can move through them to reach the key.

But wait, moving the ""stop"" block might not be enough. I need to make sure that the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property. Maybe I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" block away from the ""wall"" and ""stop"" blocks, the rule will be broken.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that overrides it. But I'm not sure. Let me try moving the ""stop"" block first.

So, my plan is:
1. Move left to reach the ""stop"" block.
2. Move up to grab it.
3. Move it down or right to disable the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Then, move through the walls to reach the key.

But I'm not sure if moving the ""stop"" block will work. Maybe I need to break the rule by separating the ""wall"" and ""stop"" blocks. Let me see, the ""wall"" rule is 9 steps to the left and 1 step up, and the ""stop"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I move the ""stop"" block away, the rule ""wall is stop"" will be broken.

Yes, that makes sense. So, by moving the ""stop"" block, I can make the walls passable. Then, I can move through them to reach the key.

So, I'll start by moving left to reach the ""stop"" block. Let's do that step by step.

Wait, there are walls and other rules around. The walls are at various positions, and some of them are marked as ""stop,"" which probably means I can't move through them. I also see a ball and a door, but I'm not sure how they factor in yet. 

The rules are made up of text blocks like ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`."" Maybe I can move these around to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""win,"" that might change the win condition. But right now, the key is already the win condition, so maybe I need to get to it directly.

I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. The key is to the right and up, but there are walls in the way. I need to see if I can move around them or change the rules to make the walls passable. 

Looking at the walls, they are defined by ""wall is stop."" So, if I can change that rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, I could push through them. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block away from the wall.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" block somewhere else, the walls might no longer be stoppable. That could allow me to move through them. So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls so that the walls are no longer stoppable, then move through them to reach the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block. It's currently at 1 step up. I can move up to get to it, then move it somewhere else, like down or to the side. Once the ""stop"" is moved, the walls won't block me anymore.

So, the steps would be:
1. Move up to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Move through the walls to reach the key, which is the win condition.

I think moving up is the first step to access the ""stop"" rule. Let me try that.

Wait, but there are walls and other rules around. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up, another wall 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, and so on. It seems like there's a vertical line of walls on the left side. 

I also see a ball 2 steps to the left. Maybe that's a distraction or something I can use. There's a door rule 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Doors usually require keys to open, but I don't have a key yet. 

Hmm, the key is to the right and up. I'm currently at the starting position, which I think is the origin point. So, to get to the key, I need to move right and up. But are there any obstacles in the way? Let me check the walls again. 

The walls are mostly on the left side, so moving right might be clear. But I should also consider the rules. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up, which probably means that moving up from there would stop me. But I'm not sure if that's in my path. 

Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 1 step up. So, if I move right once and up once, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking that path. Let me visualize the map. 

Starting from my position, moving right once would take me to (1,0). Then moving up once would take me to (1,1), which is where the key is. Are there any walls at (1,1)? Looking back, the walls are at 3 steps left and various up positions, so (1,1) should be clear. 

But wait, the rule ""stop"" is 1 step up. Does that mean that moving up from my current position would stop me? If I'm at (0,0), moving up to (0,1) would hit the ""stop"" rule, making me unable to move further. That's a problem because I need to get to (1,1). 

So, maybe I should move right first to avoid the ""stop"" rule. If I move right to (1,0), then moving up to (1,1) should be fine because the ""stop"" rule is at (0,1), not (1,1). 

Let me confirm. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up from my current position, which is (0,1). So, moving up from (0,0) would stop me at (0,1). But if I move right to (1,0), then moving up to (1,1) shouldn't be stopped because there's no ""stop"" rule there. 

Yes, that makes sense. So, the plan is to move right once, then up once to reach the key. 

But wait, are there any other rules or objects that might interfere? Let me check again. The door is 1 step left and 1 step down, which is not on my path. The ball is 2 steps left, also not in my way. 

So, the steps are: right, then up. That should get me to the key, which is the win condition. 

I think that's the best course of action. Let's do it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it. The key is at 1 step up, which is probably just above me. But wait, there are walls and other rules around. 

I see a rule `stop` at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. That might be a problem because if I move left, I could hit a stop block, which would prevent me from moving further. Also, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 1 step up, which might block my path if I go that way.

The ball is 3 steps to the left, and there's a door rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. Maybe the door is blocking the path to the key. If I can move the door or change the rules, I might be able to get through.

I also notice that there are multiple walls and rule blocks. Maybe I can rearrange some of these to create a new rule that helps me reach the key. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could become the key and win immediately. But how?

I need to move the rule blocks. The rule `is` is 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up, and the rule `key` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move the `is` block next to the `key` block, I can create a new rule like ""baba is key."" 

To do that, I might need to move left a few times to get to the `is` block. But I have to be careful not to hit the stop block. Let me plan my moves:

1. Move left once to get closer to the `is` block.
2. Then, move up to reach the `is` block.
3. Once I'm next to the `is` block, I can move it to create a new rule.

Wait, but moving left might take me into the stop block. I need to check the exact positions. The stop block is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I'm currently at the starting position, moving left once would take me to the stop block, which would prevent me from moving further. That's not good.

Maybe I should move up first to avoid the stop block. If I move up, I can go around the stop block and then move left to reach the `is` block. Let me try that:

1. Move up once to go over the stop block.
2. Then, move left to reach the `is` block.
3. Once there, move the `is` block next to the `key` block to create ""baba is key.""

But I'm not sure if moving up is possible because there might be walls in the way. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the left and 2 steps up, which is probably above me. So moving up might not be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get around. The key is 1 step up, so if I move right, I might find a path. But the door is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down, which might be in the way.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think the best approach is to move left carefully, avoiding the stop block, and then rearrange the `is` and `key` blocks to create a new rule that allows me to win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a rule ""is"" at 7 steps left and 2 up, a wall at 3 left and 2 up, a key at 2 up, another ""is"" rule at 1 right and 2 up, and a win rule at 2 right and 2 up. There's also a wall rule at 8 left and 1 up, and a wall at 3 left and 1 up. The stop rule is at 1 up, the key is at 1 right and 1 up, walls at 3 left, ball at 2 left, walls at 3 left and 1 down, a door rule at 1 left and 1 down, walls at 3 left and 2 down, 3 left and 3 down, a baba rule at 8 left and 4 down, an ""is"" rule at 7 left and 4 down, a ""you"" rule at 6 left and 4 down, and a wall at 3 left and 4 down.

Hmm, so I need to get the key to win. The key is at 2 up, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the key or change the rules to make the wall passable. Let me think about the rules. If I can make the wall into something else, like a door, I can pass through. 

Looking at the door rule, it's at 1 left and 1 down. If I can move that to the wall's position, maybe I can turn the wall into a door. Alternatively, I could change the wall's property. 

Wait, the wall is at 3 left and 1 up. If I can move the door rule next to the wall, maybe the wall becomes a door. Or perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. The stop rule is at 1 up, which might be preventing me from moving through the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the wall's property. For example, if I can make the wall into a ""you"" or something else that I can pass through. 

Let me try to move the door rule to the wall's position. The door rule is at 1 left and 1 down. I need to move it to 3 left and 1 up. That would require moving it 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But I'm not sure if that's possible in one move. 

Wait, maybe I can move the wall rule. The wall rule is at 8 left and 1 up. If I move it somewhere else, maybe the wall disappears. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. 

Another idea: since the key is at 2 up, maybe I can move the key down to where I am. The key is at 2 up, so if I move it down, it would come towards me. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving through walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. The active rule is ""key is win,"" so if I can make something else the win condition, I might win without needing the key. But that seems risky because I don't know what else is available. 

Wait, there's a ball at 2 left. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. If I can make the ball into a win condition, but I don't see a rule for that. 

Let me think again about the walls. If I can make the wall into a door, I can pass through. The door rule is at 1 left and 1 down. If I can move that to the wall's position, maybe it changes the wall into a door. 

So, to move the door rule to the wall's position, I need to move it 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But each action is just one step. So I would need to move it step by step. But since I'm Baba, I can only move one step at a time. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to the door's position. The wall rule is at 8 left and 1 up. If I move it to 1 left and 1 down, that might change the door into a wall, which isn't helpful. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the wall. The ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. If I move it to the wall's position, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I place ""is"" next to the wall, I can make a new rule like ""wall is door."" 

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 7 left and 2 up to 3 left and 2 up, where the wall is. That would require moving it 4 steps to the right. But I can only move one step at a time. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall to where the ""is"" rule is. But walls are usually immovable unless the rules say otherwise. 

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" So I can move Baba, which is me. I need to get to the key. The key is at 2 up, but there's a wall in the way. 

Maybe I can move the key down. The key is at 2 up, so if I can move it down, it would come towards me. But how? I can only move text blocks, not the key directly unless it's a text block. 

Wait, the key is an object, not a text block. So I can't move it. Hmm. 

Maybe I can change the rule so that the key is something else. For example, if I can make the key into a door, I can pass through it. But I don't see a rule for that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall into a stop, but that would make it more immovable. 

Wait, the stop rule is at 1 up. If I can move the stop rule away, maybe the wall becomes passable. So if I move the stop rule down, the wall might no longer stop me. 

So, the stop rule is at 1 up. If I move it down, say to 1 up and 1 down, which is where the door rule is. But I'm not sure if that would help. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the stop rule to the wall's position, making the wall a stop, but that would make it more solid. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me look at the other rules. 

There's a ""baba"" rule at 8 left and 4 down, an ""is"" rule at 7 left and 4 down, and a ""you"" rule at 6 left and 4 down. If I can move these to create a new rule, like ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But I'm not sure if that's possible. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm already controlling Baba. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then just being Baba would win the level. But I need to create that rule. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to Baba. Baba is at my current position, which I think is the origin. So if I can move the ""is"" rule to where I am, and then move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can create ""baba is win."" 

But the ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. I need to move it to my position. That would require moving it 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But I can only move one step at a time. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to where I am. The ""win"" rule is at 2 right and 2 up. If I can move it to my position, and then have the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create ""baba is win."" 

But again, moving rules requires moving them one step at a time. 

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 2 left. If I can make the ball into a win condition, but I don't see a rule for that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a door or something else. 

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try moving the door rule to the wall's position to turn the wall into a door. Let's try that. 

The door rule is at 1 left and 1 down. I need to move it to 3 left and 1 up. So, I need to move it 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. 

But I can only move one step at a time. So first, I can move the door rule up. 

Wait, but the door rule is at 1 left and 1 down. If I move it up, it would go to 1 left. Then, I can move it right twice to get to 3 left. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to the door's position. The wall rule is at 8 left and 1 up. If I move it to 1 left and 1 down, that would change the door into a wall, which isn't helpful. 

Hmm, maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to the wall to create a new rule. 

The ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. If I move it to 3 left and 2 up, where the wall is, I can create ""wall is something."" But I need to decide what. 

If I can move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can make ""wall is win,"" but that doesn't help me pass through. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""door"" rule next to it, I can make ""wall is door,"" which would allow me to pass through. 

So, first, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the wall's position. That requires moving it 4 steps to the right. 

But I can only move one step at a time. So I'll start by moving the ""is"" rule one step to the right. 

Wait, but how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move text blocks, so I need to move the ""is"" rule by moving it one step at a time. 

So, the ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. I'll move it one step to the right, to 6 left and 2 up. 

Then, I'll move it again to 5 left and 2 up, and so on, until it's at 3 left and 2 up, where the wall is. 

Once the ""is"" rule is next to the wall, I can create a new rule. Then, I need to move the ""door"" rule next to it to make ""wall is door."" 

But this seems like it will take multiple steps, and I'm not sure if I can do it in the allowed moves. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to the wall's position directly. 

The ""door"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. I need to move it to 3 left and 1 up. 

So, first, I can move it up to 1 left. Then, move it right twice to 3 left. Then, move it up to 3 left and 1 up. 

But again, this requires multiple moves, and I'm not sure if I can do it in one step. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule up first. 

So, the ""door"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. If I move it up, it goes to 1 left. Then, I can move it right twice to 3 left, and then up to 3 left and 1 up. 

But I can only choose one action at a time. So I need to decide which step to take first. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 up. If I move it down, it might stop blocking the wall. 

So, moving the ""stop"" rule down to 1 up and 1 down. 

But I'm not sure if that would help. 

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule one step to the right to start creating the ""wall is door"" rule. 

So, I'll move the ""is"" rule from 7 left and 2 up to 6 left and 2 up. 

That's one step. Then, in the next move, I can move it again to 5 left and 2 up, and so on. 

But since I can only choose one action, I'll start with moving the ""is"" rule to the right. 

Wait, but the ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. Moving it right would decrease the left steps. So, moving it right once would make it 6 left and 2 up. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So, my first action would be to move the ""is"" rule one step to the right. 

But how do I represent that in the action? I think I need to specify the direction to move. 

Wait, the possible actions are idle, up, right, down, left. So, I need to choose one of these directions to move. 

But I'm Baba, so moving right would move me to the right. But I need to move the ""is"" rule, not myself. 

Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by moving into them. So, if I move into the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up and move it. 

So, to move the ""is"" rule, I need to move into it. 

The ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. My current position is the origin, I think. So, to get to the ""is"" rule, I need to move left 7 times and up 2 times. 

But that's a lot of steps, and I can only move one step at a time. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule towards me by moving it right and down. 

But I can only move myself, not the rules directly. So, I need to move into the ""is"" rule to pick it up. 

So, first, I need to move left 7 times and up 2 times to reach the ""is"" rule. 

But that's not feasible in one move. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule by moving into it. So, if I move left, I can pick it up. 

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to move into the ""is"" rule's position. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule by moving the text block. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently. 

The key is at 2 up, but there's a wall blocking the way. I need to get to the key. 

If I can make the wall into a door, I can pass through. To do that, I need to create the rule ""wall is door."" 

To create that rule, I need to have the ""wall"" text block next to the ""is"" text block and the ""door"" text block. 

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""door"" rule next to the wall. 

The wall is at 3 left and 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. The ""door"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. 

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule to 3 left and 2 up, and the ""door"" rule to 3 left and 1 up. 

But that requires moving both rules, which would take multiple steps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to the wall's position. 

The ""door"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. To move it to 3 left and 1 up, I need to move it 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. 

But I can only move one step at a time. 

So, first, I can move the ""door"" rule up to 1 left. Then, move it right twice to 3 left, and then up to 3 left and 1 up. 

But I can only choose one action, so I'll start by moving the ""door"" rule up. 

So, moving up from 1 left and 1 down to 1 left. 

That would be the first step. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule first. 

The ""is"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. I can move it right to 6 left and 2 up. 

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. 

I think the most straightforward way is to move the ""door"" rule up to 1 left, then right to 2 left, then right to 3 left, and then up to 3 left and 1 up. 

But since I can only choose one action, I'll start by moving the ""door"" rule up. 

So, my action would be to move up. 

Wait, but moving up would move me up, not the ""door"" rule. 

Ah, right, I need to move into the ""door"" rule to pick it up. 

So, the ""door"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. To pick it up, I need to move down and left. 

But I'm at the origin. So, moving left would take me to 1 left, then moving down would take me to 1 left and 1 down, where the ""door"" rule is. 

So, first, I move left to 1 left. Then, I move down to pick up the ""door"" rule. 

But I can only choose one action at a time. So, my first action would be to move left. 

Then, in the next step, I can move down to pick up the ""door"" rule. 

But since I can only choose one action now, I'll choose to move left. 

Wait, but the user is asking for the next action, not a sequence. 

So, perhaps I should move left to start moving towards the ""door"" rule. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get closer to the key. 

But the wall is blocking the way. 

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the best first step is to move left to start moving towards the ""door"" rule, which I can then use to","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key somewhere, and I need to get to it to win. The key is located 1 step to the right and 1 step up from my current position. But wait, there are walls and other rules around. 

I see a rule `stop` 1 step up. That probably means that if I move up, I'll hit a stop block, which I can't pass through. So moving up isn't an option. 

To the right, there's a wall 3 steps to the left. Hmm, that might be a barrier. Also, there's a ball 2 steps to the left. I'm not sure what the ball does, but maybe it's just an obstacle. 

The door is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Doors usually require a key to open, but since the key is the win condition, maybe I don't need to worry about that right now. 

I need to get to the key. Since moving up is blocked by a stop, I should try moving right or down. Let me check the path to the right. There's a wall 3 steps to the left, but I'm not sure how that affects me. Maybe I can move right towards the key. 

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. But moving up is blocked. So maybe I should move right first, then see if I can go up. But if I move right, will I hit a wall? There's a wall 3 steps to the left, but I'm moving right, so maybe that's not an issue. 

Alternatively, I could move down to avoid the stop block. Let me see. Moving down might lead me closer to the door or the ball. But I need to get to the key. 

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" I can move around, but I can't pass through walls or stop blocks. So I need a clear path to the key. 

Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I'll be closer to the key. Then, maybe I can move up if possible. But if the stop block is in the way, I might need to find another route. 

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So if I move right, I'll be next to the key, but I can't move up because of the stop. Maybe I can move down instead. 

Alternatively, maybe I can break a rule. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule, I might change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. 

I think the best approach is to move right towards the key. Let's try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you."" That means the key is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there are several rules and walls. The key is located 1 step up, which is directly above me. The door is two steps to the left and one step down. There's also a ball three steps to the left. 

I need to figure out how to get the key to win. Since the key is right above me, maybe I can move up to grab it. But wait, are there any walls blocking me? Let me check. There's a wall four steps to the left and two steps up, but that's not directly in my path. The walls seem to be more on the left side. 

I also notice there's a rule ""stop"" one step to the left and one step up. That might be a problem if I move left, but since the key is up, I should focus on moving up. 

Wait, the ball is three steps to the left. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure how. The door is two steps left and one down, but I don't see a way to open it yet. 

Since the key is right above me, the simplest action is to move up. That should let me pick up the key and win the level. I don't see any immediate obstacles in that direction, so moving up seems safe.
