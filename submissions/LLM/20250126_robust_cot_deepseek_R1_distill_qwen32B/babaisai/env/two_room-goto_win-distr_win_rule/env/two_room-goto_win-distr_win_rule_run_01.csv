Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move to get to either of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step up from my current position. Doors usually require keys to open, but I don't see a key nearby. Wait, the key is a win condition, so maybe I can reach it without the door. Let me check where the key is. The rule `key` is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but I'm not sure if that's the actual key object or just the rule. Hmm, maybe I need to move the rule blocks to change the rules.

I see several rule blocks around. For example, there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make something else stop or change the movement rules. Also, there are multiple ""is"" and ""win"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to create a new rule that helps me.

The door is one step up, but it's blocked by walls. The walls are at various positions, but I can't move through them unless I change the rules. If I can make the walls stop being walls, I might be able to pass through. How can I do that? Maybe by changing the rule for walls. Right now, the rule is ""wall is stop"", which makes them immovable. If I can change that, perhaps I can make them passable.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule three steps to the left and two steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is you"" or ""wall is win"". But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, I could try to break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving one of the components.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make the walls not stop anymore. Let me see: if I move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, the walls might lose their stopping property. But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be able to move it, which means it shouldn't be defined as stop. But since it's a rule, maybe I can manipulate it by moving the text blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that overrides the wall's stop property. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm.

Another approach: the door is one step up, but it's behind walls. If I can make the door not require a key, that would help. The door's rule is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can move that rule to change the door's properties.

Wait, the key is a win condition, so maybe I can reach the key without going through the door. Let me check where the key is. The rule `key` is at 5 steps right and 3 up, but the actual key object might be elsewhere. Or maybe the key is the rule itself. I'm a bit confused.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the door is up. To the right, there are walls and rule blocks. To the left, there's a ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move left to get to the ""stop"" rule and then manipulate it.

If I move left, I can reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, perhaps I can move it somewhere else, which would remove the stop property from walls. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by combining different text blocks.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is win"", then Baba would be the win condition, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I could open the door. But I don't see a ""key"" rule near me. The ""key"" rule is at 5 right and 3 up, which is quite far.

Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it, the walls might become passable. Let me try to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule. So, my first move should be left.

Wait, but if I move left, I might be able to pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it elsewhere. Let me try that. So, I'll move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it up or down to change the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""wall"" and ""is"" with something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is you"", then I could move through walls. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the rule blocks.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The goal is to reach the ball or the key. The ball is two steps up, but it's behind walls. The key is further to the right. Maybe I can find a way to make the walls not block me.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps left. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls not stop. So, moving left to get to the ""stop"" rule, then moving it somewhere else. Let's say I move it down, so the walls no longer have the stop property. Then, I can walk through them.

So, my plan is: move left to get to the ""stop"" rule, then move it down. That way, the walls become passable. Then, I can go up to the door and maybe find the key or ball.

But wait, moving the ""stop"" rule might affect all walls, making them passable. That could help me navigate through the level more easily.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""wall"" and ""is"" with something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"", but I don't see a ""push"" rule. Or ""wall is win"", but that might not help.

I think the best approach is to move left to the ""stop"" rule and then move it down, which would remove the stop property from walls. That way, I can pass through the walls and reach the door or the key.

So, my first action should be to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it somewhere else to change the rules.

To manipulate the rules, I'll move left to access the ""stop"" rule and change the walls' properties.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move to get to either of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, but I don't see a key nearby. Wait, the key is a win condition, so maybe I can reach it without the door. Let me check where the key is. The rule `key` is at 6 steps to the right, so the key object is probably there. But to get there, I might need to move through the door or find another path.

There's a wall three steps to the right and three steps up. That might block my path. Also, there are several rule blocks around, which I can move to change the rules. For example, the rule `stop` is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make something else stop or change the movement rules.

I notice that the ball is one step to the right and two steps up. That's closer than the key. If I can reach the ball, I win. But how? There's a door in the way. Maybe I can change the door's properties. The rule `door` is eight steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the door into something else or change its behavior.

Wait, the door is one step up and one step to the right. If I can make the door into a win condition, then stepping on it would win. But the current rules don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a passable object by changing its rule.

Let me think about the rules. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" I can move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to the door, I can make ""door is win."" That way, stepping on the door would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule block to where the ""win"" rule is. But the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and three steps up. The ""door"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and three steps down. So I need to move the ""door"" rule up to where the ""win"" rule is.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move them if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent something from stopping me. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to another object to make it stop.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall that's blocking me. If I make the wall stop, then I can pass through it. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me see: the wall is three steps to the right and three steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule there, the wall would become stop, meaning I can't move through it. That's the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a passable object. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is you,"" then I can control it. But that might not help me win. Or, if I make ""door is win,"" then stepping on it would win.

Let me plan the steps. I need to move the ""door"" rule block to where the ""win"" rule is. The ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 3 up. So I need to move the ""door"" rule up by 6 steps (from 3 down to 3 up). That's a lot, but maybe possible.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move them if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent the rule blocks from being stopped. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to another object to make it stop.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall that's blocking me. If I make the wall stop, then I can pass through it. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me see: the wall is three steps to the right and three steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule there, the wall would become stop, meaning I can't move through it. That's the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a passable object. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is you,"" then I can control it. But that might not help me win. Or, if I make ""door is win,"" then stepping on it would win.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the door. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 3 up. The door is at 1 right, 1 up. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down and left. But that's a long distance. Maybe it's easier to move the ""door"" rule up.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. But it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, the ball is one step to the right and two steps up. There's a wall three steps to the right and three steps up. Maybe I can move the wall to let me pass. But how? I can't move walls unless they're defined as stop. Wait, the wall is defined as ""wall is stop"" because it's a wall. So I can't move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the wall's rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall won't stop me. But the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move that, maybe I can make the wall not stop.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left. If I move it to the wall's position, then the wall would become stop, which is worse. Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to another object, maybe I can make that object stop, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. Let me try that. I need to move the ""door"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is. So I need to move the ""door"" rule from 8 right, 3 down to 8 right, 3 up. That's moving up by 6 steps. But how do I do that? I can only move one step at a time, and I have to move the rule blocks.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect door and win. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" then I can form ""door is win.""

So, the ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 3 up. So if I can move the ""door"" rule up to 8 right, 3 up, then I can have ""door is win.""

But how do I move the ""door"" rule? I need to move it up step by step. Each move is one step. So from 8 right, 3 down to 8 right, 3 up is 6 steps up. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the door is. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 3 up. If I move it down to 8 right, 3 down, then I can have ""door is win.""

But that would require moving the ""win"" rule down 6 steps. That's also a lot.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect door and win. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move it to 8 right, 3 up, then I can have ""door is win"" if the ""door"" rule is there.

But the ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. So I need to move it up to 8 right, 3 up. That's 6 steps up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to 8 right, 3 down, where the ""door"" rule is. Then, I can have ""door is win.""

But that would require moving the ""win"" rule down 6 steps.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me look at the other objects. There's a ball one step to the right and two steps up. If I can reach the ball, I win. But there's a door in the way. Maybe I can make the door into a passable object.

Wait, the door is one step up and one step right. If I can make the door into a ""you"" object, then I can control it. But I'm not sure if that helps me win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""win"" condition. Then, stepping on it would win. But I need to create the rule ""door is win.""

So, to do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, or move the ""win"" rule to where the ""door"" rule is, and have the ""is"" rule in between.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 3 up. The ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. So if I can move the ""door"" rule up to 8 right, 3 up, then I can have ""door is win.""

But how do I move the ""door"" rule? I can only move it one step at a time. So I need to move it up 6 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to 8 right, 3 down, where the ""door"" rule is. Then, I can have ""door is win.""

But that would require moving the ""win"" rule down 6 steps.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 8 right, 3 down, and then move the ""win"" rule there as well. But that might not form the correct rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall to make it passable. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left. If I can move it to the wall's position, then the wall would become stop, which is worse. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make the wall into a passable object by changing its rule. The wall is at 3 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from it, then the wall won't stop me. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe the wall won't be stop anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to another object, like the ball, to make it stop. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. But it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into a win condition. But it's already a win condition. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make the door into a win condition by moving the ""win"" rule to it. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 8 right, 3 up to 8 right, 3 down, where the ""door"" rule is. Then, I can have ""door is win.""

But that's moving the ""win"" rule down 6 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule up 6 steps to where the ""win"" rule is. Then, I can have ""door is win.""

But how do I move the ""door"" rule? I can only move it one step at a time. So I need to plan a path for it.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. To move it up, I need to move it step by step. Each move is one step. So I need to move it up 6 times.

But that would take a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a passable object by changing its rule. If I can make the door into a ""you"" object, then I can control it and maybe move it out of the way.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think: if I can make ""door is you,"" then I can control it. But I'm already controlling Baba, so maybe I can have multiple objects under my control.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. Maybe I can only control one object at a time.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""win"" condition. Then, stepping on it would win.

So, to do that, I need to create the rule ""door is win."" That requires moving the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win.""

The ""is"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 3 up. The ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down.

So, if I can move the ""door"" rule up to 8 right, 3 up, then I can have ""door is win.""

But that's moving it up 6 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to 8 right, 3 down, where the ""door"" rule is. Then, I can have ""door is win.""

But that's moving the ""win"" rule down 6 steps.

Hmm, I'm not sure which is easier. Maybe moving the ""door"" rule up is better because the ""win"" rule is already in a good position.

So, I need to move the ""door"" rule from 8 right, 3 down to 8 right, 3 up. That's 6 steps up.

But how do I do that? I can only move one step at a time. So I need to plan the path.

Wait, but the ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. To move it up, I need to move it step by step. Each move is one step. So I need to move it up 6 times.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 8 right, 3 down, and then move the ""win"" rule there. Then, I can have ""door is win.""

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule from 7 right, 3 up to 8 right, 3 down, which is 1 right and 6 down. That's a lot of steps.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me look at the other objects again.

There's a ball one step to the right and two steps up. If I can reach the ball, I win. But there's a door in the way. Maybe I can make the door into a passable object.

Wait, the door is one step up and one step right. If I can make the door into a ""you"" object, then I can control it. But I'm not sure if that helps me win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""win"" condition. Then, stepping on it would win. But I need to create the rule ""door is win.""

But that's moving it up 6 steps. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

But that's moving the ""win"" rule down 6 steps.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me think: if I can make ""door is you,"" then I can control it. But I'm already controlling Baba, so maybe I can have multiple objects under my control.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. Maybe I can only control one object at a time.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""win"" condition. Then, stepping on it would win.

So, to do that, I need to create the rule ""door is win."" That requires moving the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". That means if I can get to a ball or a key, I win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba around.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step to the right and one step up. There's also a ball one step to the right and two steps up. The door is probably blocking the way to the ball or the key. I need to figure out how to open the door or bypass it.

The rules are made up of text blocks. I can move these blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the door passable. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move it somewhere else, the door might not stop me anymore.

Wait, the door is at (right 1, up 1). The rule for the door is at (right 8, down 3). I can't reach that directly. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving some blocks. If I can make ""door is you"", then I can control the door and move it out of the way. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think about the current setup.

I'm at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. The ball is nearby, but the door is in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the door's position, making the door stop me. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make the door not stop me, I can pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (left 1). If I move the ""stop"" rule to the door's position, then the door would stop me. But I don't want that. Maybe I can remove the ""stop"" property from the door by moving the rule elsewhere.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""door is you"" by moving the ""door"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""you"". But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me see the positions.

The ""door"" rule is at (right 8, down 3). That's far away. I can't reach it directly. Maybe I can move other blocks to create a new rule nearby. For example, if I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks next to the door's position, I can make ""door is you"".

But how do I move those blocks? The ""is"" blocks are scattered around. There's one at (right 7, up 3), another at (left 1, up 2), and another at (left 1, down 3). Maybe I can move one of them next to the door.

Wait, the ""is"" block at (right 7, up 3) is close to the ""ball"" rule at (right 6, up 3). If I move the ""is"" block to the right, it would be next to the ""ball"" rule, making ""ball is something"". But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block at (left 1, up 2) to the right, but I'm not sure where that leads. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through the door.

Another idea: if I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution. Let me check the objects again.

The key is at (right 6). If I can get to the key, I can win. But the door is blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it passable. The ""key"" rule is at (right 6). If I can make ""key is you"", then I can control the key and move it.

Wait, but I'm already ""baba is you"". Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you"". But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to the door's position, making the door stop me, but that doesn't help. Maybe I can remove the ""stop"" property from the door by moving the rule elsewhere.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (left 1). If I move it to the right, maybe I can make the door not stop me. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to the right, it would no longer affect the door. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: since the door is at (right 1, up 1), and I'm at the starting position, maybe I can move up and right to reach it. But the door is blocking the way. If I can make the door not stop me, I can pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (left 1). If I can move the ""stop"" rule to the door's position, then the door would stop me. But I don't want that. I want the door to not stop me.

Alternatively, if I can make the door not have the ""stop"" property, I can pass through. Maybe by moving the ""stop"" rule elsewhere, the door's ""stop"" property is removed.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule from (left 1) to somewhere else, like (left 2), so the door no longer has the ""stop"" property. Then, I can move through the door to reach the ball or key.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Since I'm at the starting position, I can move left to reach the ""stop"" rule. Let me see:

- Move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
- Then, move it further left or up/down to move it away from the door.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might affect other objects. I need to make sure that moving it doesn't create new problems.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes the door passable. For example, ""door is you"" would allow me to control the door, but I'm not sure how to do that.

Another idea: if I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me check the objects again.

The door is at (right 1, up 1). If I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on it would win. But I need to create that rule. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""win"".

The ""door"" rule is at (right 8, down 3). That's far away. I can't reach it directly. Maybe I can move other blocks to create the rule nearby.

Wait, the ""is"" block at (right 7, up 3) is close to the ""ball"" rule. If I move the ""is"" block to the right, it would be next to the ""ball"" rule, making ""ball is something"". But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block at (left 1, up 2) to the right, but I'm not sure where that leads. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through the door.

Another approach: since the door is at (right 1, up 1), and I'm at the starting position, maybe I can move up and right to reach it. But the door is blocking the way. If I can make the door not stop me, I can pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (left 1). If I can move the ""stop"" rule to the door's position, then the door would stop me. But I don't want that. I want the door to not stop me.

Alternatively, if I can make the door not have the ""stop"" property, I can pass through. Maybe by moving the ""stop"" rule elsewhere, the door's ""stop"" property is removed.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule from (left 1) to somewhere else, like (left 2), so the door no longer has the ""stop"" property. Then, I can move through the door to reach the ball or key.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Since I'm at the starting position, I can move left to reach the ""stop"" rule. Let me see:

- Move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
- Then, move it further left or up/down to move it away from the door.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might affect other objects. I need to make sure that moving it doesn't create new problems.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes the door passable. For example, ""door is you"" would allow me to control the door, but I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" block at (left 1, up 2) to the right, but I'm not sure where that leads. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through the door.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first. Let's try that.

So, I'll move left to reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, I'll move it further left to (left 2). That way, the door no longer has the ""stop"" property, and I can pass through.

But wait, moving the ""stop"" rule might affect other objects. I need to make sure that moving it doesn't create new problems. For example, if another object was using the ""stop"" rule, moving it might make that object passable as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position where it doesn't affect the door. Let's say I move it to (left 2). Then, the door's ""stop"" property is removed, and I can pass through.

Once I'm through the door, I can reach the ball or key and win the level. So, the steps are:

1. Move left to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule further left to (left 2).
3. Move right and up to go through the door.
4. Move to the ball or key to win.

I think that's a viable plan. Let's try it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move to get to either the ball or the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door that's two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, but since ""key is win,"" maybe I can reach the key first. The key is located seven steps to the right. But wait, there's a wall four steps to the right, so I might need to go around it.

I also see that there are several rule blocks. The ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and three up, and the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three up. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change what counts as a win or make the ball or key more accessible.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to avoid walls. The door is in the way, so perhaps I need to open it. But without the key, I can't open it. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules so that the door isn't a barrier anymore.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make the door or something else stop moving or become passable. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me think about the positions. The ball is two steps to the right and two up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps right and one up. So, maybe I can go up first to reach the ball, but there are walls in the way. Alternatively, I can go right to reach the key, but the door is blocking the path.

Hmm, maybe I should try to move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""door is stop,"" then the door would become a wall, but that might not help. Or maybe ""door is you,"" which would let me control the door, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you,"" then I could control the key and move it to where I am. But I don't know if that's possible with the current rules.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba. So, maybe I can move towards the ball first. The ball is two steps right and two up. Let me try moving right twice and up twice. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall four steps to the right and three up. So, if I go right four steps, I'll hit a wall. Maybe I can go up first to avoid it. Let me try moving up first.

If I move up, I can get closer to the ball. The ball is two steps up, so moving up twice would get me there, but I need to check the path. There's a wall four steps right and two up, so if I go right two steps and up two steps, I might hit a wall. Maybe I should go up first, then right.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and move it to where I am. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and three up. If I can move that closer, maybe I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure how to move rule blocks. I think I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop.""

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make other objects stop or become movable. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The key is seven steps to the right, but if I can move the ""key"" rule to the left, maybe I can make the key appear closer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the door first. The door is two steps right and one up. If I can open it, I might find the key on the other side. But without the key, I can't open it. Unless I can change the rules to make the door open without a key.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. If I can create a rule like ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move towards the ball or key.
2. Avoid walls.
3. Manipulate rules if possible.

Since the ball is closer, maybe I should go for that first. Let me try moving right two steps and up two steps. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Wait, the wall is four steps right and three up. So, if I go right two steps and up two steps, I might not hit the wall yet. Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the ball. Let me try moving up twice, then right twice.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should try moving right first to see if I can reach the key.

Wait, the key is seven steps to the right, which is quite far. There's a wall four steps to the right, so I might need to go around it. Maybe I can go up first to avoid the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""wall is pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving towards the door and see if I can manipulate it somehow. The door is two steps right and one up. If I can make the door into a win condition, then I can win by reaching it.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a key, so that when I reach it, it counts as winning. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. If I can move that closer, maybe I can create a new rule. But I'm not sure how to move rule blocks.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball first and see what happens. Let me try moving right two steps and up two steps.

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think again.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win the level. Also, since ""baba is you,"" I can move around as the Baba character.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need to get the key first. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it without worrying about the door. However, the door might be blocking the path to the key or the ball.

I see that there are several walls around, which are probably obstacles. The rule ""stop"" is one step to the left, which might mean that if I move left, I can't go further because of a stop block. I should be careful not to get stuck there.

The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. So, the door is closer to me than the key. Maybe I can go through the door first, but I don't have the key yet. Alternatively, maybe I can move around the door to reach the key or the ball.

I also notice that there are rule blocks for ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""door."" These can be rearranged to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I might change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me plan my path. I need to get to either the key or the ball. The ball is closer, so maybe I should go for that first. But the door is in the way. If I can move up two steps and right two steps, I can reach the ball. Let me check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall four steps to the right and three steps up. That's probably above the ball, so maybe I can go around it. Alternatively, if I move up first, I might find a clear path. Let me try moving up two steps to get closer to the ball.

Wait, but moving up might take me into a wall. Let me check the walls again. There's a wall four steps to the right and two steps up, which is right where the ball is. So, maybe the ball is behind a wall. That complicates things. I might need to break the wall or find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first. If I go right two steps, I can reach the door. But without the key, I can't open it. So, perhaps I need to find another route. Let me see if there's a way around the walls.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall four steps to the right and one step up, which is directly in front of me. So, I can't go straight right. Maybe I can move up first to go around. If I move up two steps, I can then move right two steps to reach the ball. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. So, if I move up two steps and then right two steps, I should reach it. Let me try that. First, move up two steps, then right two steps. That should get me to the ball, which is a win condition. Alternatively, if the path is blocked, I might need to adjust.

Another option is to go for the key. The key is seven steps to the right. That's quite far, but maybe it's the only way to open the door to reach the ball. However, since the key is a win condition, maybe I can just reach it without needing the door. Let me see where the key is located.

The key is seven steps to the right. There are walls to the right, but perhaps I can navigate around them. Let me try moving right step by step, checking for walls. If I move right four steps, I might hit a wall, so I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down to find a path. There are walls below as well, so I'm not sure. It might be safer to go for the ball first since it's closer. Let me try moving up two steps and then right two steps to reach the ball.

Wait, but the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up from my current position. So, moving up two steps and then right two steps should get me there. Let me check if there are any walls in that path. The wall is four steps to the right and two steps up, which is exactly where the ball is. So, the ball is behind a wall. That means I can't reach it directly.

Hmm, maybe I need to break the wall. But in Baba Is You, walls can be moved if they're not defined as ""stop."" Let me check the rules. The active rules don't mention walls being stop, so maybe I can move them. If I can move the wall that's blocking the ball, I can reach it.

To move the wall, I need to be adjacent to it. So, I need to get next to the wall that's four steps to the right and two steps up. Let me plan how to get there. I can move right four steps and up two steps, but I need to make sure I don't hit any other walls along the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer. Let me try moving up two steps, then right four steps. But I might hit walls in between. Let me check the walls again. There's a wall four steps to the right and one step up, which is directly in front of me. So, moving right from my current position is blocked.

Wait, maybe I can move left first to get around. The rule ""stop"" is one step to the left, so moving left might not be possible. Let me check. If I move left, I might hit the stop block and can't move further. So, moving left isn't helpful.

Another idea: maybe I can move down to find a path. There are walls below, but perhaps I can go around. Let me try moving down one step, then right four steps, then up two steps. But I'm not sure if that's possible without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right three steps, then up two steps. Let me see. Moving right three steps would take me to the wall at four steps right and one step up. So, I can't go beyond that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move up one step, then right three steps, then up one step. Let me check. Moving up one step, then right three steps would take me to the wall at four steps right and one step up. So, I can't go further right. This is tricky.

Perhaps I need to rearrange the rules to make the walls movable. If I can move the ""wall"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can change the rule to ""wall is stop,"" making them immovable. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to change something else. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the ball or the key.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule block. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the door, I might be able to open it without the key. But I don't know how to do that yet.

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. Maybe I can push the wall that's blocking the ball. To do that, I need to be next to it. Let me try moving up two steps and right three steps to get next to the wall. But I might hit other walls along the way.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me list the possible paths again:

1. Go for the ball: It's two steps up and two steps right, but blocked by a wall.
2. Go for the key: Seven steps to the right, which is far and possibly blocked.
3. Open the door: Two steps right and one step up, but needs the key.

Since the door is closer, maybe I can try to get the key first. But the key is seven steps to the right, which is a long way. Let me see if I can find a path to the key.

Moving right four steps, I hit a wall. So, I need to go around. Maybe move up first, then right. Let me try moving up two steps, then right four steps. But the wall is at four steps right and two steps up, so I can't go further. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move up three steps, then right four steps. Let me check. Moving up three steps, then right four steps would take me beyond the wall. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right three steps, then up two steps. But the wall is at four steps right and two steps up, so I can't go beyond three steps right without hitting the wall.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the walls movable. Let me look at the rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule block one step to the left and two steps up. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can change the rule to ""wall is stop,"" making them immovable. But I'm not sure if that helps me.

Wait, actually, if walls are already stop, then they are immovable. But in the current rules, ""wall"" isn't defined as stop, so maybe I can move them. Let me try moving a wall to clear the path.

To move a wall, I need to be adjacent to it. Let me try moving up two steps to get closer to the wall at four steps right and two steps up. Then, I can push it to the side. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall down. If I can move the wall down, I can create a path to the ball. Let me try that. I need to get next to the wall, then move it down.

But how do I get next to the wall? It's four steps to the right and two steps up. I need to navigate there without hitting other walls. Let me try moving right three steps, then up two steps. But the wall is at four steps right and two steps up, so I can't go beyond three steps right.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. Let me try moving up two steps, then right three steps. That should get me next to the wall. Then, I can push it to the right or left.

If I push the wall to the right, it might clear the path to the ball. Let me try that. So, my plan is:

1. Move up two steps.
2. Move right three steps to get next to the wall.
3. Push the wall to the right, making space for the ball.

After that, I can move to the ball and win the level. Let me see if that works.

Wait, but pushing the wall might require me to be adjacent and then move in the direction I want the wall to go. So, after getting next to the wall, I can move right, which would push the wall right.

Let me try that. So, the actions would be:

1. up
2. up
3. right
4. right
5. right
6. right

Wait, no, that's too many steps. Let me correct that. To get next to the wall at four steps right and two steps up, I need to move up two steps and right three steps. So:

1. up
2. up
3. right
4. right
5. right

Now I'm at three steps right and two steps up, next to the wall at four steps right and two steps up. Then, I can move right again to push the wall to the right.

So, action 6: right

This should move the wall to five steps right and two steps up, clearing the path to the ball.

Now, I can move to the ball's original position, which is two steps right and two steps up. Wait, no, the ball was at two steps right and two steps up, but the wall was at four steps right and two steps up. So, after moving the wall, the ball is now accessible.

Wait, no, the ball is at two steps right and two steps up, which is to the left of the wall. So, after moving the wall to the right, the ball is still blocked by another wall? Or is it clear?

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my plan. Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall down instead of right. Let me try that.

After getting next to the wall at four steps right and two steps up, I can move down to push the wall down. So, action 6: down

This would move the wall to four steps right and one step up, which might clear the path.

Then, I can move to the ball's position. Let me see:

After moving the wall down, the path to the ball at two steps right and two steps up is clear. So, I can move:

7. left
8. left
9. left
10. down
11. down

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should move left from the wall's new position.

Alternatively, after moving the wall down, I can go back left to reach the ball.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me try to outline the steps clearly:

1. Move up two steps to get closer to the wall blocking the ball.
2. Move right three steps to get next to the wall.
3. Move down to push the wall down, clearing the path.
4. Move left three steps to return to the starting area.
5. Move up two steps to reach the ball.

But I'm not sure if this will work without hitting other walls. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: since the door is two steps right and one step up, and it's a win condition if I have the key, maybe I can try to get the key first. But the key is seven steps to the right, which is far. Let me see if I can find a path.

Moving right four steps is blocked by a wall. So, I need to go around. Maybe move up first, then right. Let me try:

1. up
2. up
3. right
4. right
5. right
6. right

But at four steps right and two steps up, there's a wall. So, I can't go further. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move up three steps, then right four steps. Let me check:

1. up
2. up
3. up
4. right
5. right
6. right
7. right

But at four steps right and three steps up, there's a wall. So, I'm stuck again.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the walls movable or change the win condition. Let me look at the rule blocks again.

There's a ""ball"" rule block seven steps to the right and three steps up. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can change the rule to ""ball is win,"" which is already active. So, that doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""door"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""open,"" I can make the door open without a key. But I don't see an ""open"" rule block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into the key or the ball. If I can change ""baba is key,"" then I can open the door. Let me see how to do that.

The ""baba"" rule block is one step to the left and three steps down. The ""is"" rule block is three steps down. The ""you"" rule block is one step to the right and three steps down. So, if I can move the ""baba"" rule block next to ""is"" and ""key,"" I can make ""baba is key.""

But that would require moving the ""baba"" block, which is three steps down and one step left. Let me see if I can get there.

1. Move down three steps.
2. Move left one step to get to the ""baba"" rule block.
3. Then, move the ""is"" block next to it.
4. Then, move the ""key"" block next to ""is.""

But this seems complicated and time-consuming. Maybe it's not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. If I can change ""door is win,"" then I can just reach the door to win. Let me see how to do that.

The ""door"" rule block is nine steps to the right and three steps down. That's far away. I'm not sure if I can get there without hitting walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different strategy. Let me try to move towards the door and see if I can find a way to get the key.

The door is two steps right and one step up. So, I can try moving right two steps and up one step. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking that path.

Wait, the wall is at four steps right and one step up, so moving right two steps and up one step should be clear. Let me try that.

1. right
2. right
3. up

Now I'm at the door. But I don't have the key, so I can't open it. Hmm.

Wait, but the key is seven steps to the right. Maybe I can go through the door if I have the key. But I don't have it yet. So, maybe I need to find another way.

Another idea: since ""key is win,"" maybe I can reach the key without opening the door. Let me see where the key is. It's seven steps to the right. So, I need to find a path to the right.

But moving right four steps is blocked by a wall. So, I need to go around. Maybe move up first, then right. Let me try:

1. up
2. up
3. right
4. right
5. right
6. right

But at four steps right and two steps up, there's a wall. So, I can't go further. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move up three steps, then right four steps. Let me check:

1. up
2. up
3. up
4. right
5. right
6. right
7. right

But at four steps right and three steps up, there's a wall. So, I'm stuck again.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling the Baba character.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need to get the key first. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it without worrying about the door. However, the door might be blocking the path to the key or the ball.

I see that there are several walls around, which are probably blocking my movement. The rules for walls are ""wall is stop,"" meaning I can't move through them. So, I need to find a way to move around or manipulate the rules to get past the walls.

The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. So, the door is right in the path towards the key and the ball. If I can open the door, I can proceed further.

But how do I open the door? I need the key. So, maybe I should try to get the key first. But the key is seven steps to the right, which is quite far. Are there any rules I can change to make this easier?

Looking at the rules, I can move the text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks, I might be able to change what counts as a win condition or make other objects winnable.

Wait, the current win conditions are ball and key. If I can make the door a win condition, maybe I can bypass it somehow. Or perhaps I can make the door into something else, like a pushable object.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules so that walls are no longer stop. If I can make walls passable, I can move through them. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can redefine it.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move the text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is part of the wall's definition. If I can move the ""stop"" block, I can change the rule. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""door,"" I can make the door stop, which might not help. Or maybe I can make ""baba is stop,"" but that would stop me, which isn't good.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""door is open"" by moving the ""is"" and ""open"" blocks. But I don't see an ""open"" block mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the door's rule, maybe I can make it into something else. The door's rule is ""door is door,"" I think. If I can change that, maybe I can make it into a win condition or something else.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Since the door is blocking the path, maybe I can go around it. Are there any other paths? The walls are on the right and left, so maybe I can move up or down.

Looking at the map, there are walls four steps to the right and three steps up, and other walls in different positions. It seems like the area is quite blocked. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make some walls passable.

Another idea: if I can make the ball or the key into something else, maybe I can reach them without going through the door. For example, if I can make the ball into a key, then maybe I can use it to open the door.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule, I might be able to change its properties. For example, if I make ""ball is key,"" then the ball would become a key, which I can use to open the door.

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule block next to ""key."" The ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and three steps up. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. So, if I can move the ""ball"" rule down to where the ""key"" rule is, I can create ""ball is key.""

But how do I move the ""ball"" rule? I need to move the text blocks. The ""ball"" rule is part of the ""ball is win"" rule. If I can break that rule, I can move the ""ball"" block elsewhere.

Wait, the ""ball is win"" rule is active. If I can move the ""win"" block away from ""ball,"" I can change the rule. The ""win"" block is nine steps to the right and three steps up. If I move it next to ""key,"" I can make ""key is win,"" but that's already the case.

Alternatively, if I move the ""ball"" block next to ""key,"" I can make ""ball is key."" That would allow me to use the ball as a key to open the door.

So, the plan is: move the ""ball"" rule block to where the ""key"" rule is, creating ""ball is key."" Then, I can pick up the ball, which now acts as a key, and use it to open the door.

But how do I move the ""ball"" rule block? I need to move it from its current position. The ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and three steps up. I need to move it down to where the ""key"" rule is, which is seven steps to the right.

So, I need to move the ""ball"" block down by three steps. That would place it at seven steps to the right and zero steps up, which is where the ""key"" rule is.

Wait, but the ""key"" rule is at seven steps to the right. So, if I move the ""ball"" block down to that position, I can create ""ball is key.""

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""ball"" block directly. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" block instead. The ""is"" block is eight steps to the right and three steps up. If I move it down to where the ""key"" rule is, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block up to where the ""ball"" rule is. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. If I move it up three steps, it would be at seven steps to the right and three steps up, where the ""ball"" rule is. Then, I can create ""key is ball,"" which would make the key into a ball, but that might not help.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the movement. I'm Baba, and I can move up, down, left, or right. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. So, if I move right twice and up once, I can reach the door. But the door is closed, so I need the key.

The key is seven steps to the right. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a shortcut by manipulating the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move that, I can make walls passable. For example, if I move the ""stop"" block next to a wall, I can make that wall stop, but that's already the case. Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" block away, maybe I can make walls passable.

But how? The ""stop"" rule is part of the wall's definition. If I can break that rule, walls won't stop me. So, if I move the ""stop"" block away from the wall, the wall won't be stop anymore.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" block away from the wall, making walls passable. Then, I can walk through the walls to reach the key or the ball.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? It's one step to the left. I need to move it somewhere else. Maybe I can move it next to another object to create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" block next to the door, I can make ""door is stop,"" which would make the door impassable, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I move it next to ""you,"" I can make ""you is stop,"" which would stop me, which is bad.

Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" block next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is stop,"" which would stop the win condition, but that's not helpful either.

Hmm, maybe moving the ""stop"" block isn't the best approach. Let me think differently.

Another idea: if I can make the door into a win condition, then I can win by reaching the door without needing the key. But the door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block next to the ""door"" rule. The ""win"" block is nine steps to the right and three steps up. The ""door"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps down. So, I need to move the ""win"" block down to where the ""door"" rule is.

But that's a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule up instead. The ""door"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps down. If I move it up six steps, it would be at nine steps to the right and three steps up, where the ""win"" block is. Then, I can create ""door is win.""

But moving the ""door"" rule that far might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" block down to where the ""door"" rule is. That would require moving it six steps down, which might be possible.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the movement again. I'm Baba, and I can move in four directions. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can get past the door, I can reach the key or the ball.

Wait, maybe I can push the door somehow. But doors in Baba Is You usually require keys to open. So, unless I can change the rules to make the door openable without a key, I can't pass.

Another idea: if I can make the door into a pushable object, I can push it aside. To do that, I need to change the door's rule to ""door is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" block mentioned. So, that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition by moving the ""win"" block next to it. As I thought earlier, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level.

So, how can I move the ""win"" block? It's nine steps to the right and three steps up. I need to move it down to where the ""door"" rule is, which is nine steps to the right and three steps down. That's a total of six steps down. If I can move the ""win"" block down six steps, I can create ""door is win.""

But moving the ""win"" block that far might require breaking other rules. Let me see. The ""win"" block is part of the ""ball is win"" and ""key is win"" rules. If I move it, those rules will change.

For example, if I move the ""win"" block away from ""ball,"" the rule becomes ""ball is [nothing],"" which might make the ball just a regular object. Similarly, moving it away from ""key"" would make ""key is [nothing].""

But if I can create ""door is win,"" then I can win by reaching the door. So, maybe it's worth it.

So, the plan is: move the ""win"" block down six steps to where the ""door"" rule is, creating ""door is win."" Then, I can step on the door to win the level.

But how do I move the ""win"" block? I need to move it from nine steps to the right and three steps up to nine steps to the right and three steps down. That's a total of six steps down.

I can do this by moving the ""win"" block down six times. Each move is one step, so it would take six actions. But since I'm the player, I can only move myself, not the blocks directly. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by moving into them, which allows you to pick them up and move them around.

So, as Baba, I can move to the position of the ""win"" block, pick it up, and then move it down six steps. But I need to make sure that the path is clear.

Looking at the map, the ""win"" block is nine steps to the right and three steps up. To get there, I need to move right nine times and up three times. But there are walls in the way. The walls are four steps to the right and three steps up, which is where the ""win"" block is. So, the wall is blocking the path to the ""win"" block.

Wait, no, the wall is at four steps to the right and three steps up, and the ""win"" block is at nine steps to the right and three steps up. So, the wall is to the left of the ""win"" block. So, I can move right past the wall to reach the ""win"" block.

But the wall is at four steps to the right and three steps up, which is part of the wall's rule. If the wall is stop, I can't move through it. So, I need to find a way to move around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall's rule to make it passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through it.

But how? The wall's rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can move the ""stop"" block away, the rule becomes ""wall is [nothing],"" which might make it passable.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" block away from the wall's rule, making walls passable. Then, I can walk through the walls to reach the ""win"" block.

But how do I move the ""stop"" block? It's one step to the left. I need to move it somewhere else. Maybe I can move it next to another object to create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" block next to the ""door"" rule, I can make ""door is stop,"" which would make the door impassable, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I move it next to ""you,"" I can make ""you is stop,"" which would stop me, which is bad.

Alternatively, if I move the ""stop"" block next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is stop,"" which would stop the win condition, but that's not helpful either.

Hmm, maybe moving the ""stop"" block isn't the best approach. Let me think differently.

Another idea: if I can make the door into a win condition, then I can win by reaching the door without needing the key. So, I need to create ""door is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block next to the ""door"" rule. The ""win"" block is nine steps to the right and three steps up. The ""door"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps down. So, I need to move the ""win"" block down six steps.

But to move the ""win"" block, I need to get to its position. The ""win"" block is at nine steps to the right and three steps up, which is beyond the wall at four steps to the right and three steps up. So, I can't reach it unless I can move through the wall.

Wait, maybe I can move the wall's rule to make it passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through it.

But how? The wall's rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can move the ""stop"" block away, the rule becomes ""wall is [nothing],"" which might make it passable.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" block away from the wall's rule, making walls passable. Then, I can walk through the walls to reach the ""win"" block and move it to the door's rule.

But again, moving the ""stop"" block is tricky. Let me think about the movement again.

I'm Baba, and I can move up, down, left, or right. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can get past the door, I can reach the key or the ball.

Wait, maybe I can push the door somehow. But doors in Baba Is You usually require keys to open. So, unless I can change the rules to make the door openable without a key, I can't pass.

Another idea: if I can make the door into a pushable object, I can push it aside. To do that, I need to change the door's rule to ""door is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" block mentioned. So, that might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition by moving the ""win"" block next to it. As I thought earlier, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level.

So, how can I move the ""win"" block? It's nine steps to the right and three steps up. I need to move it down six steps to where the ""door"" rule is.

But to do that, I need to get to the ""win"" block's position. The wall is at four steps to the right and three steps up, blocking the path. So, I need to make the wall passable.

Wait, maybe I can move the wall's rule to make it passable. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through it.

But how? The wall's rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can move the ""stop"" block away, the rule becomes ""wall is [nothing],"" which might make it passable.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" block away from the wall's rule, making walls passable. Then, I can walk through the walls to reach the ""win"" block and move it to the door's rule.

But moving the ""stop"" block is still a problem. Let me think about the movement again.

I'm Baba, and I can move up, down, left, or right. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can get past the door, I can reach the key or the ball.

Wait, maybe I can go around the door. The door is two steps to the","

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to proceed. But first, I need to figure out how to get the key or the ball.

The rules are laid out in the form of text blocks. There's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left, which probably means that whatever is on that spot can't be moved. I should avoid moving into that area unless I can change the rule.

I see the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps right and one up. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make a path. Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the text blocks.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make a path for myself. But how? I need to move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, but I can't move it directly unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" or ""key"" rules to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" I could move through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Looking again, the ""win"" rules are at nine steps to the right and three up. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the door a win condition instead. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I just need to reach the door.

To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule and the ""win"" rule next to each other. The ""door"" rule is nine steps to the right and three down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three up. If I can move the ""win"" rule down, I can combine it with the ""door"" rule.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to move the ""is"" rule in between. The ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. If I can move the ""is"" rule down, I can connect ""door"" and ""win.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the position of the ""win"" rule, then move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. That way, ""door is win"" would be created.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""ball"" or ""key"" closer to me. The ball is two steps right and two up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule closer, I can reach it faster.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should focus on creating a new rule that allows me to move through walls or make the door a win condition.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Identify the positions of the rule blocks.
2. Determine which rules I can move.
3. Plan how to rearrange them to create a new rule.

The ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move that, I can clear a path. But I can't move it unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move another rule to override it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself something else, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is three steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to a different subject, I can change who I control. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

I think the best approach is to try to make the door a win condition. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule into position.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule down. The ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. If I can move it down to where the door is, then I can place the ""win"" rule next to it.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls. I need to find a path to the ""is"" rule.

Looking at the map, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. I'm currently at the starting position. To get there, I need to move right four times and up three times, but there are walls in the way.

Wait, the walls are positioned at four steps right and various up and down positions. Maybe I can go around them. Let me see:

- Move right four steps: but there are walls at four right and up positions. So, I can't go straight right.

Alternatively, I can move up first, then right. Let's see:

- Move up three steps, then right four steps. But there are walls at four right and two up, so that might block me.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""pass"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule in the active rules. Wait, maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule to make a new rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move it somewhere else, I can clear a path.

But I can't move the ""stop"" rule unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move another rule to override it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can combine it with the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is something,"" which might change its behavior.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself a different object, but that might not help.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the door again. The door is two steps right and one up. If I can reach the door, I might be able to open it with the key.

But the key is seven steps to the right. That's far. Maybe I can move the key closer.

Wait, the key rule is seven steps to the right. If I can move the ""key"" rule closer, I can reach it faster.

Alternatively, I can try to make the door a win condition so I don't need the key. That might be easier.

To make ""door is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three up. The door is nine steps to the right and three down. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule down.

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule into position. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule down from eight right, three up to eight right, three down.
2. Then, move the ""win"" rule from nine right, three up to nine right, three down.

But I can't move the rules directly. I need to move the text blocks by moving Baba around them.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule by moving Baba next to it and pushing it. But I can't go through walls, so I need a clear path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule by moving Baba next to it and pushing it down.

But I'm not sure how to get to the ""win"" rule. It's nine steps to the right and three up. That's a long way, and there are walls in the way.

Maybe I should try to make the ball a win condition instead. The ball is two steps right and two up. If I can reach it, I win.

But the ball is blocked by walls. Let me see:

- The ball is at two right, two up.
- There's a wall at four right, three up.
- So, maybe I can go around the walls.

Wait, the walls are at four right and various up and down positions. Maybe I can go up first, then right.

Let me try:

- Move up three steps to get past the walls.
- Then move right four steps to reach the ""is"" rule.
- But there are walls at four right and two up, so I can't go straight right.

Hmm, this is complicated. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

If I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""pass"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule and another rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can combine it with the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is something,"" which might change its behavior.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself a different object, but that might not help.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it, I can clear a path. But I can't move it unless I change the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can combine it with the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is something,"" which might change its behavior.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself a different object, but that might not help.

I think I need to try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""ball"" rule closer. The ball is two steps right and two up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule to a different position, I can reach it faster.

But I can't move the ""ball"" rule unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. If I can move it to two right and two up, I can combine it with the ""ball"" rule to make ""ball is something.""

But that's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule step by step.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. The door is nine steps to the right and three down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three up. If I can move the ""win"" rule down, I can make ""door is win.""

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule into position.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. If I can move it down to eight right and three down, then I can move the ""win"" rule to nine right and three down, making ""door is win.""

But I can't move the rules directly. I need to move the text blocks by moving Baba around them.

I think I need to move the ""is"" rule down. To do that, I need to get to the ""is"" rule's position. It's eight steps to the right and three up. That's a long way, and there are walls in the way.

Maybe I can go up first, then right. Let me try:

- Move up three steps.
- Then move right eight steps.

But there are walls at four right and various up positions. So, I can't go straight right.

Alternatively, I can try to go around the walls. Let me see:

- Move up one step.
- Move right four steps (but there's a wall at four right, two up).
- Hmm, that's blocked.

Maybe I can move up two steps, then right four steps. But again, the wall is in the way.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""pass"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule and another rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can combine it with the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is something,"" which might change its behavior.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself a different object, but that might not help.

I think I need to try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it, I can clear a path. But I can't move it unless I change the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left, I can combine it with the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is something,"" which might change its behavior.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make myself a different object, but that might not help.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""ball"" rule closer. The ball is two steps right and two up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule to a different position, I can reach it faster.

But I can't move the ""ball"" rule unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. If I can move it to two right and two up, I can combine it with the ""ball"" rule to make ""ball is something.""

But that's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule step by step.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. The door is nine steps to the right and three down. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three up. If I can move the ""win"" rule down, I can make ""door is win.""

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule into position.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three up. If I can move it down to eight right and three down, then I can move the ""win"" rule to nine right and three down, making ""door is win.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move around the map to get to either the ball or the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. There's also a wall structure that seems to be surrounding some areas. The rules are spread out, with ""ball,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" rules placed in a line to the right. Similarly, ""key,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" are also in a line further to the right. There's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left, which probably means that whatever is on that rule can't be moved or something.

I notice that the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. The walls are creating a sort of barrier, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to get through them.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the walls won't stop me anymore.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule, it's one step to the left. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe I can make the walls movable. But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move the rule blocks around to change the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is part of a rule statement. If I can break that rule, maybe the walls won't stop me. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, the wall won't have the ""stop"" property anymore, making it passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by rearranging the existing rule blocks. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control the walls, but that might not be necessary.

Let me think about the positions. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move left once, I can get to the ""stop"" rule. But I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably where Baba is. So, moving left once would take me to the ""stop"" rule. But can I move it? Or do I need to move other rule blocks to change the rule.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as ""stop."" So, if the ""stop"" rule is active, those objects can't be moved. But if I can change the rule, maybe I can make the walls movable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" or ""key"" rules to create a new win condition. But I think the goal is to reach the ball or key, so maybe I should focus on getting to them.

Looking at the door, it's two steps to the right and one step up. Maybe the door is blocking the path to the key or ball. If I can open the door, I can proceed further.

But to open the door, I might need a key. Wait, the key is seven steps to the right. So, maybe I need to get the key first to open the door, which would then allow me to reach the ball or another key.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the door passable without needing a key. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level, but that might not be necessary.

Let me try to plan my movements. I'm at the starting position. I need to move towards the ball or key. The ball is two steps up and two steps right. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps right and one step up.

If I move right twice and up twice, I can reach the ball. But are there walls blocking that path? The walls are at various positions, so I need to check if the path is clear.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and 3 up, which is where the ball is. So, the ball is behind a wall. That means I can't reach it directly. Similarly, the key is further to the right, behind more walls.

So, maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, then I can walk through them.

The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move it to a different position, perhaps by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" rules, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to control the walls, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, another approach: if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, making ""ball is win"" more prominent, but that's already the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make ""key is win"" more accessible.

Hmm, perhaps I should try moving the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it to a different location, the walls won't have the ""stop"" property anymore. So, I can move left once to get to the ""stop"" rule, then move it somewhere else, like down or up.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I need to move them into a position where they form a new rule. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it would make that wall stop me. But I want to remove the ""stop"" property from the walls.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule by moving either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule away, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, making the walls passable.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down or up to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Once the walls are passable, move towards the ball or key.

But wait, can I move the ""stop"" rule? Since it's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, moving it would break that rule, making the walls passable.

So, moving left once would take me to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it down or up to a new position, which would remove the ""stop"" property from the walls.

After that, I can move through the walls to reach the ball or key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule instead. If I move the ""wall"" rule away from the ""is"" and ""stop"" rules, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken.

But the ""wall"" rule is one step to the left and two steps up. So, moving it might be more complicated.

I think the easier approach is to move the ""stop"" rule. So, let's try that.

First, move left once to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, move it down or up to break the rule.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't stop me anymore. Then, I can move right and up to reach the ball or key.

So, the first action should be to move left to reach the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can get to a ball or a key, I win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba around.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. There's also a ball two steps to the right and two steps up. The door is probably blocking the way to the ball or the key. I need to figure out how to open the door or bypass it.

The rules are made up of text blocks. I see ""rule `ball`"" at 7 steps right and 3 up, ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 3 up, and ""rule `win`"" at 9 steps right and 3 up. There's also a ""rule `stop`"" one step to the left. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change how the game works.

I notice that the door is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. To get to the door, I might need to move right twice and up once. But I have to check if there are any walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I think the main path is clear.

Wait, the door is a rule `door` at 9 steps right and 3 steps down. That seems far. Maybe I don't need to go there. Instead, I should focus on the door that's closer, at 2 steps right and 1 step up.

If I can open the door, I can get to the ball or the key. But how? Maybe I need to change the rules so that the door becomes passable. If I can make the door ""stop"" or something else, I might be able to move through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make the door ""win,"" then stepping on it would end the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Let me think about the rules. The current win conditions are ball and key. If I can make the door a win condition, that might help. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block next to the door. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 up, which is far from the door.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing rules. If I move the ""ball is win"" rule apart, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""ball"" away from ""is"" and ""win,"" the rule ""ball is win"" would be broken, and ""ball"" would no longer be a win condition. Then, I can create a new rule like ""door is win.""

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" I need to check if the rule blocks are movable. The ""rule `stop`"" is one step to the left, so maybe that's a wall or an obstacle.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I move ""baba"" away, I can change what ""you"" is. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

Let me try to plan my moves. I need to get to the door, which is two steps right and one step up. So, I should move right twice and up once. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 up, which is above the door. So, moving up from the door might hit a wall. Maybe I should move right first, then up.

Wait, the door is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So, from my current position, I can move right twice and up once to reach it. Let me try that.

But before I move, I should check if the door is passable. If the door is a ""stop"" object, I can't move through it. So, maybe I need to change the door's property.

Looking at the rules, the door is defined by ""rule `door`"" at 9 steps right and 3 steps down. That's far away, so I can't reach it easily. Maybe I can create a new rule near the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door ""you,"" so I can control it. But that might complicate things.

Wait, if I can make the door ""win,"" then stepping on it would end the level. So, how can I do that? I need to create a rule like ""door is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block next to the door.

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 up, which is far from the door. I can't move it directly. Maybe I can break the existing ""win"" rule and create a new one.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""key"" as a win condition. If I can get the key, I win. So, where is the key? The ""rule `key`"" is at 7 steps right and 3 up. That's near the ""ball"" and ""is"" rules.

Wait, the ball is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So, if I can get to the ball, I win. But the door is blocking the way. Maybe I can go around the door.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 up, which is above the door. So, moving up from the door would hit a wall. Maybe I can move right past the door and then up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first, then right. Let me see: from my current position, moving up would take me to a wall, so that's not helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the door passable. If I can make the door ""stop,"" then I can't move through it, which doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make the door ""you,"" I can control it, but that might not be useful.

Wait, maybe I can make the door ""win."" If I can create a rule ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would end the level. So, how can I do that?

I need to move the ""win"" rule block next to the door. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 up, which is far. Maybe I can break the existing ""win"" rule and create a new one near the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule block next to ""win."" But the ""door"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 down, which is also far.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""ball"" rule block to make the ball a win condition without needing to go through the door.

Wait, the ball is already a win condition. So, if I can reach the ball, I win. The ball is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. So, from my current position, I can move right twice and up twice to reach it. But is there a path?

Let me check the path: moving right twice would take me to the door's position, which is two steps right and one step up. Then, moving up once more would take me to the ball. But the door is in the way. So, I need to open the door or make it passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can go around the door. Let me see: moving right once, then up once, then right once more. But I'm not sure if that's possible due to walls.

Wait, the walls are at various positions, but I think the main path is clear. Let me try to move right twice and up once to reach the door. Then, I can try to manipulate the rules to open it.

But I'm stuck because I can't move through the door. Maybe I need to change the door's property. If I can make the door ""stop,"" then I can't move through it, which doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make the door ""you,"" I can control it, but that might not be useful.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move around and change the rules if needed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, but since ""key is win,"" maybe I can just reach the key directly. But wait, the key is part of the rule ""key is win,"" so maybe it's not a physical key on the map. Hmm, that's confusing.

There are walls all around, which are probably blocking my path. The rules for walls are ""wall is stop,"" which means I can't move through them. So I need to find a way to either move the walls or change the rules so that I can pass through them.

I see that there are rule blocks for ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and ""door."" Maybe I can rearrange these to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, the walls might become passable. Or perhaps I can make the door into something else.

Let me think about the positions. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. The key rule is seven steps to the right. The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The wall rule is one step to the left and two steps up. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, maybe the walls won't block me anymore. But how do I do that? I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't move through walls. So I need to find a path to the ""stop"" rule.

Looking at the map, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. That might be accessible if I can move left. But are there walls blocking me? The wall is four steps to the right and three steps up, but I'm starting from the origin, so maybe I can move left without hitting a wall immediately.

Wait, the wall is four steps to the right and three steps up, but I'm at the starting point. So to the left, there's a wall one step to the left and two steps up. Hmm, maybe I can move left and up to reach the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I could become a wall and move through them, but that might not be helpful.

Another idea: if I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. But the door is two steps to the right and one step up, which might be blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the door rule to make the door into something else.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the ""door"" rule to combine it with ""win,"" then the door would become a win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and I need to move towards the ""stop"" rule to the left. If I move left once, I might reach the ""stop"" rule. But is there a wall blocking me? The wall is one step to the left and two steps up, so maybe moving left once would take me to the ""stop"" rule without hitting a wall.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, then the walls might no longer stop me. So my plan is to move left to reach the ""stop"" rule, then move it somewhere else to deactivate the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change what a wall is. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I could become a wall and move through them, but that might not help me win.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba around. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can make the walls passable. Let me try moving left to reach the ""stop"" rule.

So, I'll start by moving left once. That should take me to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it down or somewhere else to deactivate it. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't block me anymore, and I can move freely.

After moving the ""stop"" rule, I can then move towards the door or the key. Since ""key is win,"" reaching the key would win the level. But where is the key? The key rule is seven steps to the right. Maybe I can move towards it once the walls are passable.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the key, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. But I'm not sure. Let me focus on moving the ""stop"" rule first.

So, my first action should be to move left to reach the ""stop"" rule. That way, I can deactivate the walls and have a clear path to the key or door.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it without going through the door. Hmm.

There are walls all around, which are probably blocking my path. I see a rule `stop` one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable or something. But how?

I also notice the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. That's pretty close. If I can get to the ball, I win. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls not stop me.

Let me think about the rules. The current rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" If I can create a new rule, like ""wall is not stop,"" that might let me walk through walls. But how do I do that? I need to move the rule `is` and `stop` to form a new rule.

Looking at the objects, the rule `is` is two steps up, and the rule `stop` is one step to the left. If I can move the `is` rule next to `stop`, I can create ""stop is something,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can move the `wall` rule and `is` together to make ""wall is stop"" or ""wall is not stop.""

Wait, if I can move the `wall` rule to be next to `is` and `stop`, I could create ""wall is stop,"" which might make walls stop me, but that's already the case. Or maybe ""wall is not stop,"" which would let me pass through walls. That sounds useful.

To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule and the `is` rule and the `stop` rule into a new position. But how? I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So I need to see if I can move the `wall` rule or the `is` rule.

The `wall` rule is one step to the left and two steps up. The `is` rule is two steps up. The `stop` rule is one step to the left. Maybe I can move the `is` rule next to `stop` to make ""is is stop,"" but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe move the `wall` rule next to `is` to make ""wall is something.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `baba` rule and `is` and `you` to change what Baba is. If I can make ""baba is not you,"" that might not help, but if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could win by reaching myself. But that seems complicated.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can go through the door without needing a key. But I don't see a rule `open` on the map. Hmm.

Let me look again. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. The key is seven steps to the right. That's pretty far. Maybe I should try to get the ball first since it's closer.

But the walls are blocking the way. So I need to find a way to move through walls. If I can make walls not stop me, that would help. So I need to create a rule like ""wall is not stop.""

To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule, the `is` rule, and the `not` rule (if there is one) or maybe just rearrange them. Wait, I don't see a `not` rule. Maybe I can break an existing rule to create a new one.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `stop` rule next to the `wall` rule to make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Or maybe move the `stop` rule somewhere else to disable it.

Wait, if I can move the `stop` rule away from the wall, maybe the walls won't stop me anymore. Let me see where the `stop` rule is. It's one step to the left. If I can move it somewhere else, like next to the door, maybe the walls will no longer have the stop property.

So, my plan is: move the `stop` rule away from the walls so that walls no longer stop me. Then I can walk through them to reach the ball or the key.

To do that, I need to move the `stop` rule. But how? I can only move text blocks, so I need to move the `stop` rule to a new position. Let me see where it is: one step to the left. So from my current position, I can move left to pick it up and then move it somewhere else.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I'm at the starting position. Let me check the objects again. The `stop` rule is one step to the left. So if I move left, I can pick it up. Then I can move it to a different location, like next to the door or somewhere else.

Once I move the `stop` rule away, the walls might no longer stop me. Then I can move through them to reach the ball or the key.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left to pick up the `stop` rule.
2. Move it to a new position, maybe next to the door.
3. Then, move through the walls to reach the ball or the key.

But wait, can I move the `stop` rule? I think I can, because it's a text block. So let's try that.

First, I need to move left to get the `stop` rule. So my first action should be to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move around and possibly change the rules to my advantage.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, but since ""key is win,"" maybe I can use that somehow. There are also walls and various rule blocks scattered around. The rule blocks are important because moving them can change the active rules.

I notice that the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make something else stop or change its behavior. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and three steps down, and ""you"" is one step to the right and three steps down. Maybe I can rearrange these to change what Baba is.

The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can get to the ball, I win, but there might be obstacles. The key is seven steps to the right, which is pretty far. Maybe I can find a way to make the key come to me or change the rules so I don't need it.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change what Baba is. If I can move the ""baba"" rule and the ""you"" rule, I might be able to make Baba into something else, like a key or a ball, which would let me win immediately.

Looking at the positions, the ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and three steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba,"" maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key"" or ""baba is ball,"" which would make me into the win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. If I can bring it next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I might be able to make ""key is win"" more accessible.

But since the door is two steps to the right and one step up, maybe I can go through it if I can get the key. But since ""key is win,"" maybe I don't need to go through the door. Maybe I can just reach the key directly.

Wait, but the key is seven steps to the right, which is quite far. There are walls in the way, so maybe I can't get there directly. Perhaps I need to change the rules to make the key come to me or make something else into a key.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key, and since ""key is win,"" I would win. So how can I do that? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

Looking at the positions, the ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. The ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. The ""is"" rule is in multiple places, but maybe I can use one that's closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" making ""baba is key."" That would make me the key, and I'd win.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move them if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can prevent something from stopping me.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away so I can move other rules more freely. If I move the ""stop"" rule down or somewhere else, it might not block me anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to create a new rule. Let me see: if I can get ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""key,"" then ""baba is key"" would be a new rule, making me the key and thus the winner.

So, the plan is: move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to create ""baba is key."" But how do I do that? I need to move the ""key"" rule seven steps to the right to where ""baba"" is. That seems difficult because it's far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""key"" rule is. The ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. If I can move it to the right, maybe I can bring it closer to the ""key"" rule.

Wait, but moving rules requires me to be adjacent to them, right? So I need to navigate to where the ""key"" rule is, which is seven steps to the right. That's a long way, and there might be walls blocking me.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls won't stop me. But I already have ""stop"" as a rule one step to the left. Maybe I can move that.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move it next to ""wall"" and ""is,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would mean walls stop me. But I already have walls; maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, but that might not help.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around as Baba. The door is two steps to the right and one step up. Maybe I can go through the door if I can get the key. But since ""key is win,"" maybe I don't need to go through the door. Maybe I can just reach the key.

But the key is seven steps to the right. There are walls in the way. Let me see the layout:

- Walls are at various positions, including 4 steps right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, etc. So there's a wall two steps to the right and one step up, which is right where the door is. So maybe the door is behind a wall.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right and one step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but that's further to the right. So maybe the door is accessible.

Wait, no, the door is at 2 steps right and 1 up, and there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 up. So the door is two steps right and one up, which is before the wall at four steps right. So maybe I can reach the door without going through the wall.

But to get to the door, I need to move right twice and up once. Let me see if there are any walls blocking that path. The walls are at 4 steps right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, etc. So moving two steps right and one up should be clear.

So I can move to the door. But the door requires a key. Since ""key is win,"" maybe I can make the door into a key or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. If I can make ""door is win,"" then going through the door would win me the level.

But how? I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""door"" and ""is."" The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps up. That's far away. Maybe I can bring it closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is you,"" so the door becomes me, and then I can win by being the door. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can make ""baba is door,"" which would make me the door, and then I can win by being the door. But I'm not sure if that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is win,"" so stepping on the door would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""door"" and ""is.""

But the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps up, which is far. Maybe I can move it closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create ""door is win."" But that would require moving the ""is"" rule, which is in multiple places.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps up, among others. Maybe I can use one of the closer ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""door"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps down. That's also far.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see: the ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. If I can reach the ball, I win. So maybe I can go to the ball instead of the key.

But the ball is two steps right and two up. Let me see if that's accessible. There's a wall at four steps right and two up, but the ball is at two right and two up, so maybe it's accessible.

Wait, the ball is at two steps right and two up, and there's a wall at four steps right and two up. So the ball is before the wall. So I can move right twice and up twice to reach the ball.

But wait, moving up twice from my starting position might take me into walls. Let me check the walls:

- Walls are at 4 steps right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, etc. So moving up twice from my starting position (assuming I start at 0,0) would take me to (2,2), which is where the ball is. So I can reach the ball directly.

Wait, but the ball is two steps right and two up, so that's (2,2). Are there any walls blocking that path? The walls are at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), etc. So moving to (2,2) should be clear.

So if I move right twice and up twice, I can reach the ball and win. That seems straightforward. But why is the key involved? Maybe the key is a distraction, or maybe I need to use it for something else.

Alternatively, maybe the ball is behind a wall. Let me check: the ball is at (2,2), and the wall is at (4,2). So the ball is before the wall. So I can reach it without going through the wall.

So the plan is: move right twice and up twice to reach the ball and win.

But wait, the initial position is not given, but assuming I start at (0,0), moving right twice and up twice would take me to (2,2), where the ball is.

So the actions would be: right, right, up, up.

But the game might require me to do it in one move, but I think each step is an action. So I need to choose the next action.

Wait, the user is asking for the next action, not the entire sequence. So the first step would be to move right.

But let me double-check. If I move right, I go to (1,0). Then right again to (2,0). Then up to (2,1), then up to (2,2) where the ball is.

So the first action is right.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, but the ball is at (2,2), so moving right twice and up twice is the way to go.

So the first action is right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to figure out how to move and manipulate the rules to get to the win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. There's also a ball one step to the right and two steps up, and a key six steps to the right. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible.

I notice that there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules to make something else stop or allow me to pass through walls. Also, there are ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" rules three steps down, which might be useful for changing my own properties.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, perhaps I can make the walls stop me or not. But I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by rearranging the text blocks. For example, if I can get ""baba"" and ""win"" together, maybe I can make Baba the win condition, but that's already the case since ""baba is you"" and ""you"" is the player.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting to the key or the ball. The key is six steps to the right, which seems far, but maybe there's a shortcut. The ball is closer, only one step to the right and two up. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the layout again.

The walls are positioned at 3 steps right and 3 up, 3 right and 2 up, 3 right and 1 up, and so on. It seems like there's a vertical line of walls on the right side. Maybe I can go around them by moving down first. If I move down, I can avoid the walls and then move right towards the key or the ball.

Wait, but moving down might take me closer to the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the walls stop me, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can make the door stop, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to the door, maybe I can make the door a win condition. That way, I just need to reach the door instead of the key or the ball. Let me check where the door is. It's one step to the right and one step up. If I can make the door ""win,"" then reaching it would end the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door. The ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by manipulating other rules first.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door ""stop,"" so it doesn't block me. But I'm not sure how that would help. Or perhaps I can make the door ""you,"" so I can control it, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, another approach: if I can make the walls ""stop,"" then I can walk through them. But I'm not sure if that's possible. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left. If I can move that next to a wall, maybe I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure how that would help me pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls ""you,"" so I can control them and move them out of the way. But I don't see a ""you"" rule near the walls. The ""you"" rule is three steps down, so maybe I can move it next to a wall.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is three steps down. If I can move that next to a wall, I can make that wall ""you,"" meaning I can control it. Then, I can move the wall out of the way to create a path.

So, here's a plan: move down to where the ""you"" rule is, then move it next to a wall. Once the wall is ""you,"" I can move it. Then, I can clear a path to the key or the ball.

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? I need to move the ""you"" rule block. It's three steps down. So, I need to move down three times to reach it. Once I'm there, I can pick it up and move it next to a wall.

Wait, but can I move the ""you"" rule? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move myself, but can I move the rule blocks? I think in Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks by pushing them, but only if they're not fixed. I need to check if the ""you"" rule is movable.

Assuming it is, I can move down three times to get to the ""you"" rule. Then, I can move it next to a wall. Let's say I move it next to the wall that's three steps to the right and three steps up. Then, the wall becomes ""you,"" and I can move it.

Once I move the wall, I can create a path to the key or the ball. The key is six steps to the right, which is quite far, but the ball is closer. Maybe I can go for the ball first.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to it. The door is one step right and one up. The ""win"" rule is eight steps right and three up, which is too far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by manipulating other rules.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by combining ""door"" and ""win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, then ""door is win,"" and reaching the door would win the level. That might be easier than going all the way to the key or the ball.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's eight steps to the right and three up. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path or use other rule blocks to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""you,"" so I can control it and move it to the win condition. The ball is one step right and two up. If I can make it ""you,"" I can move it to the win condition.

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule next to the ball. The ""you"" rule is three steps down, so I need to move it up two steps and right one step to reach the ball. That might be possible.

Wait, but moving the ""you"" rule requires me to be next to it, pick it up, and move it. So, I need to move down three times to get to the ""you"" rule, then move it up two and right one to the ball. Then, the ball becomes ""you,"" and I can control it.

Once the ball is ""you,"" I can move it to the win condition, which is either the key or the ball itself. But since the ball is already ""win,"" maybe I can just move it to where I am, but that might not work.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""stop,"" so it blocks something, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the door is one step right and one up. If I can get to the door, maybe I can open it somehow. But I don't see a key nearby. The key is six steps to the right, which is far.

Wait, maybe I can make the door ""stop,"" so it doesn't block me. But I'm not sure how that would help. Alternatively, maybe I can make the door ""you,"" so I can control it and open it without a key.

To make the door ""you,"" I need to move the ""you"" rule next to the door. The door is one step right and one up. The ""you"" rule is three steps down. So, I need to move the ""you"" rule up four steps and right one step. That seems possible if I can move it.

But again, moving the ""you"" rule requires me to be next to it, pick it up, and move it. So, I need to move down three times to get to the ""you"" rule, then move it up four and right one to the door.

Once the door is ""you,"" I can control it and maybe open it without a key. Then, I can proceed to the next area where the key or the ball is.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door ""win,"" so reaching it wins the level. That would be easier than going all the way to the key or the ball.

But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door. The ""win"" rule is eight steps right and three up, which is too far. Maybe I can find a way to move it closer.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by combining ""door"" and ""win."" If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, then ""door is win,"" and reaching the door would win the level.

But moving the ""win"" rule eight steps right and three up is too far. Maybe I can find a shortcut or use other rule blocks to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls ""stop,"" so I can walk through them. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left. If I can move that next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Wait, maybe if I make a wall ""stop,"" I can then move through it because it's stopped. But I'm not sure if that's how it works.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls ""you,"" so I can control them and move them out of the way. The ""you"" rule is three steps down, so I can move it next to a wall.

So, here's a plan: move down three times to get to the ""you"" rule, then move it next to a wall. Once the wall is ""you,"" I can move it out of the way, creating a path to the key or the ball.

Once the path is clear, I can move right towards the key or the ball. The key is six steps right, which is far, but the ball is closer, one step right and two up. So, maybe I can go for the ball first.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball ""win,"" but it's already ""win."" So, reaching it would win the level.

Wait, but the ball is one step right and two up, but there are walls blocking the way. If I can move the walls, I can create a path to the ball.

So, to summarize, I think the best course of action is to move down to get the ""you"" rule, then move it next to a wall to make that wall ""you,"" allowing me to move the wall and clear a path to the ball or the key.

So, first, I need to move down three times to reach the ""you"" rule. Then, I can move it next to a wall. Let's say I move it next to the wall that's three steps right and three up. Then, that wall becomes ""you,"" and I can move it down or left to clear the path.

Once the wall is moved, I can go right towards the ball or the key. The ball is closer, so I'll aim for that.

So, the first step is to move down to reach the ""you"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door that's one step to the right and two steps up. Doors usually require keys to open, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. There's also a wall three steps to the right and four steps up, which might be blocking my path. The ball is one step to the right and three steps up, and the key is six steps to the right and one step up. 

I notice that the ball is closer to me, so maybe I should go for that first. But wait, there's a wall in the way. The wall is three steps to the right and four steps up, which might be blocking the path to the ball. I need to figure out how to move the wall or change the rules to get past it.

There are also several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the left and one step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something else stop or change the movement rules. But I'm not sure how to use that yet.

Another idea: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change what Baba is. If I can move the ""baba"" rule block, I might be able to make Baba into something else, like a key or a ball, which could help me win without needing to reach the actual key or ball.

Let me think about the positions again. The door is one step to the right and two steps up. If I can get through the door, maybe that leads to the key or ball. But the door is probably locked, so I might need the key. Alternatively, if I can change the door's properties, I might be able to open it without a key.

Wait, the key is six steps to the right and one step up. That's quite far. Maybe I should focus on the ball first since it's closer. But the wall is blocking the way. How can I move the wall? If I can change the rules, maybe I can make the wall movable or turn it into something else.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule two steps to the left and three steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another thought: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""you"" rule block to something else. If I can make ""key is you,"" then I would be the key, and maybe I can unlock the door or something else. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""you"" block.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is three steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change what ""you"" is. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and I need to move right and up to reach the ball. But there's a wall blocking the way. Maybe I can go around the wall. Let me check the other directions. To the left, there's a ""stop"" rule. If I move left, I might get stuck because of the ""stop"" rule. So maybe going right is the only option.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall. But the wall is three steps to the right and four steps up, so moving up might not help. Hmm.

Wait, the door is one step to the right and two steps up. If I can get to the door, maybe I can go through it to reach the key or ball. But the door is probably locked. So I need the key. But the key is six steps to the right and one step up, which is far. Maybe I can find a shortcut or change the rules to make the door open without a key.

Another idea: if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can go through it without needing the key. But I don't see a rule block that says ""door is open."" Maybe I can create that by moving the ""is"" and ""open"" blocks, but I don't see an ""open"" block mentioned.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""door is stop,"" then the door would stop me, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is door,"" then the door would act as a stop, which might not be useful.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. My goal is to reach either the ball or the key. The ball is closer but blocked by a wall. The key is farther but might be accessible if I can go around or change the rules.

Maybe I should try to move the wall. If I can redefine the wall's properties, I might be able to pass through it. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the wall out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule block mentioned, so I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" which would remove the wall. But again, I don't see a ""nothing"" rule block. Hmm.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left and one step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make the wall stop me, but that doesn't help. Or maybe I can make something else stop, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change what Baba is. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I would be the key, and I could unlock the door. But I don't see a ""key"" rule block near me. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right and one step up, which is far.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I already have ""baba is you,"" so I can't change that unless I move the ""you"" rule block.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is three steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change what ""you"" is. For example, if I can make ""you is win,"" then I would win by being myself. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try moving in a different direction. Let me try moving up first to see if I can find a way around the wall. If I move up, I might find another rule block that can help me.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to reach the key first, even though it's farther. If I can get the key, I can open the door and reach the ball or win directly. But the key is six steps to the right and one step up, which is a long path. I need to see if there's a way to get there without being blocked.

Wait, the key is six steps to the right and one step up. That's to the right and slightly up. Maybe I can go around the wall by moving right first and then up. Let me check the path. If I move right, I might encounter other walls or rule blocks that can help me.

Another idea: if I can make ""key is you,"" then I would be the key, and I could unlock the door. But I don't see a way to do that with the current rule blocks.

I'm still stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the ""win"" rule block.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is eight steps to the right and three steps up. That's far, but maybe I can move it closer. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I can win by reaching the door. But I don't see a way to do that right now.

I think I need to try moving in a specific direction to see if I can find a rule block that can help me. Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I might find the ""key"" rule block or other useful rule blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to move the ""ball"" rule block to make the ball winnable. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, the ball is one step to the right and three steps up. If I can reach it, I can win. But the wall is blocking the way. Maybe I can move the wall by changing its rule.

I think I need to try moving the wall's rule block. If I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push the wall out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule block. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" and ""push"" blocks, but I don't see a ""push"" block.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can find a way around. Let me try moving up and see what happens.

That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach the key directly.

I see walls around, which are probably blocking my path. The rules for walls are ""wall is stop,"" which means I can't move through them. So I need to find a way around or manipulate the rules to change that.

There are also rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""ball"" rule six steps to the right and three up, and similarly for ""is"" and ""win."" Maybe I can move these rule blocks to create new rules or change existing ones.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls. I need to see if I can move any rule blocks to change the rules. For instance, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, maybe the walls won't block me anymore.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the walls passable. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is you"" to turn a wall into something I can control.

Another idea: if I can make ""door is open"" or something similar, I might be able to pass through without needing the key. But I don't see a rule for that yet.

Let me think about the positions. The door is one step right and one up. To get there, I might need to move up and right, but walls are blocking the way. Maybe if I can move the rule blocks to change the walls' properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer to me. The key is six steps to the right. If I can bring it closer, I can reach it without dealing with the door.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is six steps to the right. If I can move that rule block, I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" which is already active, but maybe I can make ""key is you"" to turn the key into something I can control.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to visualize the map. There's a door in the way, and walls around it. The key is on the other side, maybe. If I can't get through the door, maybe I can find another path or change the rules to make the walls passable.

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change myself into something else. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can just step on myself to win, but that might not be possible.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change who I am. For example, if I can make ""door is you,"" I could control the door and open it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to make something else the win condition, but that might not help directly.

I think the best approach is to try to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, I can walk through them. So, I need to find a way to move the ""stop"" rule block.

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe the walls won't block me anymore. So, I should try to move the ""stop"" rule block.

To do that, I need to get next to it and push it. But to get there, I might need to move around the walls. Let me see the path. The ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left, so I need to move left twice.

But wait, moving left might take me into walls. Are there walls blocking my path? Let me check the objects again. There's a wall three steps to the right and three up, but I'm starting from the origin, so moving left should be clear.

Wait, no, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left, but there might be walls in the way. Let me check the objects on the map again. There's a wall three steps to the right and three up, but moving left from the origin, I don't see walls blocking my path immediately.

So, I can move left twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Once I'm next to it, I can push it somewhere else, maybe down or up, to remove it from the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change the walls' properties. The ""wall"" rule is two steps to the left and two up. If I can move that, I can redefine what walls are.

But I think moving the ""stop"" rule is more straightforward. So, I'll plan to move left twice to reach the ""stop"" rule, then push it down or somewhere else to make the walls passable.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls won't block me anymore, and I can move freely through them. Then, I can go to the door, get the key, and win the level.

So, the first step is to move left twice to reach the ""stop"" rule. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba around to achieve this.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need to get the key first. But where is the key? The rule ""key is win"" suggests that the key is a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it without needing to open a door. But I'm not sure yet.

I also see a ball two steps to the right and two steps up. Since ""ball is win,"" reaching the ball would also end the level. But I need to figure out how to get there. There are walls around, so I have to navigate through them.

The rules are laid out in the form of text blocks. For example, ""rule `ball`"" is seven steps to the right and three steps up. Maybe I can move these rule blocks to change the rules. If I can rearrange them, I might be able to create new rules that help me win.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left. That probably means that whatever is on that rule block can't be moved. So I need to be careful not to move any ""stop"" blocks or the objects they're attached to.

I also notice that there's a ""door"" rule block nine steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe if I can change the door's properties, I can open it without needing a key. Or perhaps I can make the door itself a win condition.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm Baba, I need to move towards either the key or the ball. The ball is closer, two steps up and two steps right. The key is seven steps to the right. Maybe I should go for the ball first.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The wall is four steps to the right and three steps up. So I can't just go straight right because of the walls. I might need to move around them. Let me visualize the map.

If I move right four steps, I hit a wall. So maybe I should go up first. If I move up three steps, I can then move right. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path. The wall is four steps right and three up, so that's exactly where I would be if I go up three and right four. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, I can move up two steps and then right four steps, but there's a wall at four right and two up. So that's also blocked. Hmm, maybe I need to find another way.

Wait, there's a door two steps right and one up. Maybe I can go through the door. But to open the door, I might need a key. Since the key is seven steps to the right, I need to figure out how to get there. But the path is blocked by walls.

Perhaps I can change the rules. If I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks, I might be able to create a new rule that allows me to win without needing to reach the key or the ball. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then just being Baba would make me win.

Looking at the rule blocks, the ""is"" block is eight steps to the right and three up. The ""win"" block is nine steps to the right and three up. If I can move the ""baba"" rule block to be next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win."" But the ""baba"" rule is one step left and three down. So I need to move it up.

But how? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is one step left. So I can't move that. I need to find a way to move the ""baba"" rule block. Maybe if I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" blocks to create a new rule that allows me to move ""baba.""

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door a win condition. The ""door"" rule is nine steps right and three down. If I can make ""door is win,"" then just being near the door would win. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the door is two steps right and one up. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I can just go to the door and win. But I need to rearrange the rules to make that happen.

Let me try to plan the steps. First, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to the ""door"" block. The ""is"" block is eight steps right and three up, and ""win"" is nine steps right and three up. The ""door"" rule is nine steps right and three down. So I need to move the ""door"" rule up to where the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are.

But moving rule blocks might require me to be adjacent to them. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to reach those rule blocks. Let me see if I can get to the ""is"" block at eight right and three up. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball or key reachable by changing the rules. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes controllable, and I can move it to the win condition. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""baba"" rule block to create ""baba is win."" That way, I can just be Baba and win. The ""baba"" rule is one step left and three down. I need to move it up to where ""is"" and ""win"" are.

But how? I can't move through walls. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block down to where ""baba"" is. The ""is"" block is eight right and three up. If I can move it down three steps, it would be at eight right and zero up, which is where I am. Then I can move it next to ""baba.""

Wait, I'm at the starting position. If I can move the ""is"" block to my location, then I can move it to create ""baba is win."" Let me try that.

So, I need to move the ""is"" block from eight right and three up to my current position. But I can't move through walls. The path is blocked. Maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" block. The ""win"" block is nine right and three up. If I can move it down to where ""baba"" is, I can create ""baba is win.""

But again, the walls are in the way. This is tricky.

Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule block. The ""key"" is seven steps to the right. If I can make ""key is you,"" then I can control the key and move it to the win condition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""stop is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I can move that, I can make other objects movable. But I can't move the ""stop"" rule because it's a stop.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try to move the ""ball"" rule block. The ""ball"" is seven steps right and three up. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block. If I can get the ""is"" block next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move right four steps to get past the initial walls.
2. Move up three steps to reach the ""is"" block.
3. Move the ""is"" block down to where ""baba"" is.
4. Create ""baba is win"" and win the level.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" block. Maybe I need to be adjacent to it to move it. So I need to get next to it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule block up. But it's three steps down. I need to move up to reach it.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. If I move down three steps, I can reach the ""baba"" rule block. Then I can move it up to where ""is"" and ""win"" are.

Let me try that:

1. Move down three steps to reach the ""baba"" rule block.
2. Move the ""baba"" rule block up three steps to where ""is"" and ""win"" are.
3. Now, ""baba is win"" is active, so I win.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""baba"" rule block. It's one step left and three down. So I need to move left one and down three to get to it.

Wait, I'm at the starting point. If I move left one step, I can reach the ""stop"" rule. But I can't move through ""stop."" So I can't move left.

Hmm, that's a problem. I can't move left because of the ""stop"" rule. So I can't reach the ""baba"" rule block that way.

Maybe I can go around. Let me see the map again. There are walls to the right and up. Maybe I can move up first, then right.

If I move up three steps, I can then move right four steps, but that's blocked by a wall. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, I can move right three steps, then up two steps. But there's a wall at four right and two up. So that's blocked.

Wait, the door is two steps right and one up. Maybe I can go through the door. But I need a key. The key is seven steps to the right. Maybe I can get the key first.

But the path to the key is blocked by walls. I need to find a way to get around.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the door's rule. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I can just go to the door and win.

The ""door"" rule is nine steps right and three down. I need to move it up to where ""is"" and ""win"" are. But I can't reach it because of the walls.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the objects again.

The ball is two steps right and two up. The key is seven steps right. The door is two right and one up. The walls are blocking the way.

Wait, maybe I can make the ball or key a win condition without needing to reach them. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and move it to the win condition.

But how? I need to rearrange the rules. The ""ball"" rule is seven right and three up. The ""is"" is eight right and three up. The ""win"" is nine right and three up.

If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create ""ball is win,"" but that's already active. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. But I need to move the ""you"" rule block.

The ""you"" rule is three steps down. I need to move it next to ""ball"" and ""is."" But I can't reach it because of the walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule block. The ""key"" is seven right and one up. If I can make ""key is you,"" I can control the key and move it to the win condition.

But again, the path is blocked. I can't reach the ""key"" rule block because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can make the door a win condition. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I can just go to the door and win. The door is two right and one up. So if I can make that rule, I can win.

But how? The ""door"" rule is nine right and three down. I need to move it up to where ""is"" and ""win"" are. But I can't reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks down to where the door is. But I can't move through walls.

This is really frustrating. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" So I can win by reaching either the ball or the key. I'm Baba, so I need to move to either of those.

The ball is two right and two up. The key is seven right. Both are blocked by walls. So I need to find a way to remove the walls or change the rules to make the path clear.

Wait, maybe I can make the walls stop being walls. If I can change the rule for walls, I can make them passable.

The ""wall"" rule is one left and two up. If I can move that, I can change the wall properties. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Or maybe ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through them. But I need to rearrange the rules.

The ""wall"" rule is one left and two up. The ""is"" is eight right and three up. The ""you"" is three down. So I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you.""

But I can't reach the ""wall"" rule because it's one left, and I can't move left due to the ""stop"" rule.

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to accept that I can't reach the ball or key directly and instead find a way to make the win condition something I can reach.

Wait, the door is two right and one up. If I can make ""door is win,"" then I can just go to the door and win. But how?

The ""door"" rule is nine right and three down. I need to move it up to where ""is"" and ""win"" are. But I can't reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks down to where the door is. But I can't move through walls.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try moving the ""is"" block. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is win.""

The ""is"" block is eight right and three up. I need to move it down three steps to where ""baba"" is. But I can't reach it because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block by being adjacent to it. If I can get next to it, I can move it. But the path is blocked.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" block. The ""win"" block is nine right and three up. If I can move it down to where ""baba"" is, I can create ""baba is win.""

But again, the walls are in the way. I can't reach the ""win"" block.

This is really challenging. I think I need to try a different strategy. Maybe I can make the ball or key reachable by changing their rules.

If I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and move it to the win condition. The ""ball"" rule is seven right and three up. The ""is"" is eight right and three up. The ""you"" is three down.

I need to move the ""you"" rule up to where ""ball"" and ""is"" are. But I can't reach the ""you"" rule because it's three down, and I can't move down through walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule down to where ""you"" is. The ""ball"" rule is seven right and three up. If I can move it down three steps, it would be at seven right and zero up, which is where I am. Then I can move it next to ""you.""

But I can't move the ""ball"" rule because it's blocked by walls.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I need to accept that I can't solve this level right now and try a different approach later.

Wait, maybe I can make the door a win condition by moving the ""win"" rule next to it. The ""win"" rule is nine right and three up. The ""door"" rule is nine right and three down. If I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the door is, I can create ""door is win.""

But I can't reach the ""win"" rule because of the walls. This is really frustrating.

I think I need to try to move the ""is"" block. If I can get next to it, I can move it to create a new rule. But I can't reach it because of the walls.

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one left. If I can move it, I can make other objects movable. But I can't move the ""stop"" rule because it's a stop.

This is really tricky. I'm not sure what to do next. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule block. The ""key"" is seven right and one up. If I can make ""key is you,"" I can control the key and move it to the win condition.

But I can't reach the ""key"" rule block because of the walls. I'm stuck.

I think I need to give up for now and try a different approach later. Maybe I'm missing something obvious.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door that's one step to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. There are walls all around, which probably block movement unless I can change the rules.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can change something. Also, there's a ""key"" rule six steps to the right. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving these blocks.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The door is in the way, so maybe I need to get the key first. But how do I get the key? It's six steps to the right, but there are walls blocking the way.

Wait, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, perhaps I can make the walls not stop me. Or maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something like that.

Let me think about the positions. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can place it somewhere else to change the rules. Alternatively, I can move other rule blocks to create new rules.

Another idea: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change what Baba is. If I can make Baba into a key or a ball, I can win immediately. But how? I need to rearrange the rule blocks to create a new rule like ""baba is key"" or ""baba is ball.""

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and three steps down, and a ""you"" rule three steps down. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""key"" or ""win,"" I can create a new rule.

But first, I need to get to those rule blocks. The walls are in the way, so maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls passable. If I move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, maybe that wall becomes passable.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule blocks to create new combinations. For example, moving ""ball"" next to ""you"" to make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball.

Wait, but the active rules already have ""baba is you,"" so maybe I can make ""ball is you"" as well, allowing me to switch between Baba and the ball. That could help me reach the key or the door.

Let me plan the steps. First, I need to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to a wall to make that wall passable. Once I can move through walls, I can reach the other rule blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is six steps to the right. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can create ""key is win,"" but that's already active. Maybe I can create ""key is you"" to control the key directly.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe it's better to focus on making the walls passable so I can reach the door and the key.

Let me try moving left to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to a wall to change its property. Once the wall isn't stopping me, I can move through it.

After that, I can go up to reach the door. But the door is one step up and one step right. Maybe I can open it by having the key, but I don't have the key yet. Alternatively, if I can make the door passable by changing its rule.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule nine steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""door is stop,"" which would block it, but that's not helpful. Maybe ""door is open"" or something, but I don't see an ""open"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""door is win,"" but that's already covered by ""ball is win"" and ""key is win."" Maybe I need to get the key first.

So, to summarize, my plan is:

1. Move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable.
3. Move through the wall to reach the key or other rule blocks.
4. Once I can move freely, collect the key or manipulate rules to win.

Let me try moving left first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it without going through the door. Hmm.

There are walls all around, which are probably blocking my path. The rules for walls are ""wall is stop,"" which means I can't move through them. So I need to find a way around or manipulate the rules to change that.

I see the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what stops me. For example, if I move ""stop"" to be associated with something else, the walls might no longer block me. But how?

I also notice the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can change that, maybe I can become something else, like the key or the ball, which would let me win immediately. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me think about the positions. The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps right and one up. The walls are surrounding me, so I might need to move up or down to get around.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left. If I can move that rule to be next to a different object, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. For example, if I move ""stop"" to be next to ""door,"" then doors would stop me, but walls wouldn't. That might let me pass through walls.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to be something else, like ""wall is push,"" then I could push the walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here, so that might not work.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba"" into something else, like ""baba is key,"" then I would become the key and win. But how do I change the rules? I need to move the text blocks.

Looking at the rules, the ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. The ""is"" rule is three steps down. The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and three steps down. If I can move these around, maybe I can rewrite the rules.

For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""key,"" I could make ""baba is key,"" which would make me the key and win. But I need to get there without being blocked by walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move that, maybe I can make the walls passable. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule to the left, away from the walls. That might allow me to move through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to be ""wall is you,"" but that doesn't make sense. Or ""wall is win,"" but that would make the walls win conditions, which isn't helpful.

I think the best approach is to manipulate the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it away from the walls, the walls won't stop me anymore. So I need to move the ""stop"" rule to a different position.

Looking at the map, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move it further left, maybe I can place it next to something else. But I'm not sure what's to the left of that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" but that's already the case because ""baba is you"" and ""you"" is me. No, that's not helpful.

I think the key is to manipulate the ""stop"" rule. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule to the left, away from the walls. That way, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the key or ball.

So, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. It's currently one step to the left. If I move it further left, maybe two steps, then the walls won't have the ""stop"" property anymore.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move the text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. So I can move left to pick it up and then move it somewhere else.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move one step at a time. So I need to plan my movements carefully.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move left to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Once I'm on the ""stop"" rule, I can pick it up.
3. Then, move left again to place it somewhere else, like next to the door or another object.

But I'm not sure if I can carry the rule while moving. In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by standing on them and then moving in a direction, which picks them up and moves them in that direction.

So, I'll try moving left to pick up the ""stop"" rule, then move left again to place it somewhere else.

After moving left twice, the ""stop"" rule will be two steps to the left. Now, the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property, so I can move through them.

Once the walls are passable, I can move up or right to reach the key or ball.

Looking at the positions, the key is seven steps to the right. That's a long way, but if the walls are passable, I can go through them.

Alternatively, the ball is two steps right and two up. That's closer. Maybe I can go up first.

Wait, but the door is two steps right and one up. If I can open the door, maybe that's a quicker path.

But the door requires a key, which is seven steps to the right. So maybe I should go for the key first.

Alternatively, if I can make the door not require a key, that would help. But I don't see a rule for that.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule first to make the walls passable.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move left again to place it somewhere else, making walls passable.
3. Then, move up or right to reach the key or ball.

Let me try that.

First, I move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule. Now, I'm carrying it.

Then, I move left again to place it two steps to the left. Now, the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property.

Now, I can move through the walls. I'll move up to go towards the ball.

After moving up, I can move right to reach the ball, which is two steps right and two up.

Wait, but the ball is also a win condition. So if I reach it, I win.

Alternatively, I can go for the key, but the ball is closer.

So, I'll move up and then right to reach the ball.

But wait, the door is in the way. If I move up, I might hit the door.

Alternatively, I can move right first, then up.

Let me see the exact positions.

The ball is two steps right and two up. The door is two right and one up.

So, if I move right twice and up twice, I can reach the ball.

But the door is in the path. If the door is blocking me, I might need the key.

But since I moved the ""stop"" rule, maybe the door doesn't stop me either.

Wait, the door's rule is ""door is stop"" by default, but I didn't change that. So I still can't pass through the door.

Hmm, maybe I should go around the door.

Alternatively, I can move up first, then right.

Let me try moving up first. I move up once, then right twice, then up once more to reach the ball.

But I'm not sure if that's the best path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first, then up.

I think the key is to move the ""stop"" rule first, then navigate to the ball or key.

So, to summarize, my steps are:

1. Move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move left again to place it elsewhere, making walls passable.
3. Move up and right to reach the ball and win.

I think that's the best course of action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right and one step up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach the key directly.

There are walls all around, which are probably blocking my path. The walls are at various positions, but I need to figure out how to move around them. The rules are laid out in the form of text blocks, which I can move to change the game's rules.

I see that there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make something else stop or change the movement rules. But I'm not sure yet.

The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps right and one up. So, the door is closer, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the door's rule to change its properties.

Wait, the door's rule is at nine steps to the right and three steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can make the door not require a key or make it openable without a key. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""key is win"" rule. If I can make the key not a win condition, then I can use it to open the door. Or maybe make the door a win condition instead.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the map. There's a wall four steps right and three up, which is probably above me. The ball is two right and two up, so maybe it's above the door. The key is seven right, which is far to the right.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move some walls or rules to create a path. Alternatively, I can try to change the rules so that I can pass through walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step left. If I can move that, maybe I can make walls not stop me. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through walls. But how do I do that?

I need to move the ""stop"" rule. It's one step to the left. So, if I move left, I can pick it up. But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me try to move left.

But wait, moving left might take me into a wall. The wall is four steps right and three up, but I'm not sure about the exact layout. Maybe I can move up first to avoid walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba is you"" rule to change my properties. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either remove the walls' stopping power or create a path. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it to combine with another rule, maybe I can change the wall's properties.

So, I'll try to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule. Once I have it, I can move it next to a wall's rule to make ""wall is stop"" into something else, like ""wall is not stop.""

But wait, I'm not sure if I can carry multiple rules. Maybe I can only move one at a time. So, I'll move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule, then move it next to a wall's rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to change its properties. The ""wall"" rule is one step left and two up. If I can move it, I can change what walls are.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try moving towards the door first. The door is two right and one up. If I can get there, maybe I can use the key once I have it.

But the door is blocked by walls. So, I need to find a way to open it or remove the walls. Maybe if I can make the door not require a key, I can walk through it.

The door's rule is nine steps right and three down. If I can move that, I can change the door's properties. But that's far away. Maybe it's better to focus on the key first.

I think the best move is to move right towards the key. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the walls' rules to make them not block me.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key is win"" rule to make the key not a win condition, so I can pick it up and use it on the door. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can make the key not a win condition, then I can collect it and use it on the door. So, I need to change ""key is win"" to something else, like ""key is not win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule away from the key. The ""win"" rule is nine steps right and three up. If I can move it, I can separate it from the key.

But that's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule to change its properties.

The ""key"" rule is seven steps right. If I can move it, I can make it not a win condition. But again, that's far.

Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule first. If I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them. So, I'll move left to get the ""stop"" rule.

Once I have it, I can move it next to a wall's rule to make ""wall is not stop."" That way, I can walk through walls.

So, my first move should be to move left to pick up the ""stop"" rule.

There are walls all around, which are probably blocking my path. The rules for walls are ""wall is stop,"" which means I can't move through them. So I need to find a way around or manipulate the rules to change that.

I see the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what stops me. For example, if I move ""stop"" to be associated with something else, the walls might no longer block me.

Also, there's a ""door"" rule nine steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe if I can change the door's properties, I can open it without needing a key.

Let me think about the steps. I'm currently at the starting position. The ball is two steps to the right and two steps up. The key is seven steps to the right. The door is two steps right and one up. The walls are in the way, so I can't go straight to the key or the door.

If I move left, I can get to the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different object. For example, if I move ""stop"" to be associated with the door, then the door would stop me, but the walls wouldn't. That might allow me to pass through the walls.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule to something else, but that might complicate things. Since the key is a win condition, maybe I should focus on getting to the key.

Wait, if I can make the walls not stop me, I can move through them. So, moving the ""stop"" rule away from the walls would help. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule to the door. That way, the door becomes a stop, but the walls don't. Then I can move through the walls to reach the key.

So, my plan is to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule, then move it down to associate it with the door. Once that's done, the walls won't block me anymore, and I can move through them to reach the key and win.

Let me check the positions again. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. So, I need to move left once to reach it. Then, I can move it down to where the door is. The door is two steps right and one up, but the rule for the door is nine steps right and three down. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location where it won't affect the walls. For example, moving it to the right or down. If I move it to the right, it might not interfere with the walls, allowing me to pass through.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to the right, it would be associated with something else, like the key or the ball. But I don't want the key or the ball to stop me. So maybe moving it down is better.

I think the best move is to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule, then move it down to a position where it doesn't affect the walls. That way, the walls won't stop me, and I can move through them to reach the key.

So, my first action should be to move left to reach the ""stop"" rule.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving left to get to the ""stop"" rule first. Let me try that.

So, I'll move left once. That should get me closer to the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can see if I can manipulate it to change the walls or the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get closer to the ball. But the walls are in the way, so I can't go up directly.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think the best first step is to move left to access the ""stop"" rule and see if I can change the properties of the walls or the door.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. How? If I move the ""stop"" rule to be associated with something else, like ""door,"" then walls might no longer block movement. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move it to combine with another rule, maybe I can change the properties. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""is,"" I could create a new rule like ""is is stop,"" but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to change its property. The ""wall"" rule is one step to the left and two steps up. If I move it next to ""is"" and another word, I could redefine what a wall is. For example, making ""wall is push"" would allow me to move through walls.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule in the objects. Hmm. Maybe I can use the existing rules to my advantage. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba to pick up rule blocks and rearrange them.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the rule blocks to change the rules. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can move it to combine with another rule.

Wait, but moving left might take me out of the play area or into walls. I need to check the map again. The wall is four steps to the right and three steps up, but I'm starting somewhere else. Maybe I can move left without hitting a wall.

Alternatively, I can move up or down to reach the rule blocks. The ""ball"" rule is seven steps to the right and three steps up. That's a long way. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right. Maybe I should focus on the key since it's a win condition.

But to get to the key, I need to pass through walls. So I need to change the wall's property first. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I can move it to be associated with something else, the walls won't stop me.

So, I'll move left to get to the ""stop"" rule. Once I have it, I can move it next to another rule to create a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""is"" and ""win"" could create ""stop is win,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, moving it next to ""wall"" to make ""wall is stop"" into something else.

Wait, the current rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can change that, I can make walls not stop me. So, I need to break that rule. How? By moving either ""wall"" or ""stop"" away from ""is.""

If I move the ""stop"" rule away, then ""wall is"" would be without a property, which might make walls passable. Or, if I move ""wall"" to another rule, like ""win,"" making ""wall is win,"" but that would make walls win conditions, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" if I have a ""push"" rule, but I don't see one. So maybe the best bet is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving either ""wall"" or ""stop.""

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. I'll move left to pick it up. Then, I'll move it down or somewhere else to break the association. Once that's done, walls won't stop me anymore, and I can move through them to reach the key or ball.

So, my first move should be to move left to get the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can rearrange it to change the rules.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step to the left. If I can move that, maybe I can make something else stop or change the movement rules. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I think the key is seven steps to the right. That's pretty far. Maybe I should go towards the key. But there are walls in the way. Let me see if I can move any rules to create a path.

Alternatively, the ball is closer, two steps right and two up. If I can reach the ball, I win. But is there a way to get there without hitting walls? Let me check the walls. There's a wall four steps right and two up, which might block the path to the ball.

Hmm, maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can go around. Or perhaps I can move left to access some rules. The rule ""wall"" is one step left and two up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties.

Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule, I can make it something else. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop me. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key"" to make myself the key, but I don't see a ""key"" rule nearby. The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right, which is far.

Let me think about the door. It's two steps right and one up. If I can open the door, maybe I can get to the key or the ball. But doors usually require keys. So maybe I need to get the key first.

But the key is seven steps to the right. That's a long way. Are there any walls blocking that path? Let me check. There's a wall four steps right and one up, which might be in the way. Maybe I can go around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop me, but I'm not sure. I think I need to move towards the key or the ball.

Wait, the ball is two steps right and two up. Let me try moving right twice and up twice. But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path. The wall is four steps right and two up, so maybe I can go around it by moving up first.

Let me try moving up first. If I move up, I can avoid the wall. Then, I can move right towards the ball. But I need to make sure there are no walls in that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to access the ""wall"" rule and change it. If I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become me, which might not be helpful. Or ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop me, but I'm already stopped by walls.

I think the best course of action is to move towards the ball. Let me try moving right twice and up twice. But I need to check the exact positions.

Wait, the ball is two steps right and two up from my current position. So, moving right twice and up twice should get me there. But I need to make sure there are no walls in that path.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall four steps right and two up. So, if I move right two steps, I'll be at position (2,0). Then, moving up two steps would take me to (2,2). Is there a wall there? The wall is at (4,2), so I think that's okay. So, moving right twice and up twice should get me to the ball.

But wait, the door is two steps right and one up. So, after moving right twice, I'm at (2,0). Then, moving up once would take me to (2,1), which is the door. But I don't have the key yet, so I can't open it. So, maybe I should go around the door.

Alternatively, I can move up first. Let me try moving up once, then right twice, then up once. That would take me to (2,2), which is where the ball is. Let me see if that path is clear.

From (0,0), move up to (0,1). Then right twice to (2,1). Then up once to (2,2). Is there a wall at (2,1)? The door is at (2,1), so I can't pass through it without the key. So, that path is blocked.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another way. Let me try moving right first. From (0,0), move right once to (1,0). Then up once to (1,1). Then right once to (2,1), which is the door. Again, blocked.

Alternatively, move right twice to (2,0), then up once to (2,1), which is the door. Still blocked.

So, maybe I need to go around the door. Let me try moving up twice first. From (0,0), up twice to (0,2). Then right twice to (2,2), which is the ball. Is there a wall at (0,2)? The wall is at (4,2), so I think that's okay. So, moving up twice and then right twice should get me to the ball.

Wait, but the wall is at (4,2), so moving right from (0,2) to (2,2) is fine. So, the path is clear. So, I can move up twice, then right twice to reach the ball and win.

But let me double-check. From (0,0), up to (0,1), then up to (0,2). Then right to (1,2), then right to (2,2). Yes, that should work. So, the actions would be up, up, right, right.

But the user wants just one action at a time. So, the first step is up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it without going through the door. Hmm.

I see walls all around, which are probably blocking my path. The rules for the walls are ""wall is stop,"" which means I can't move through them. So I need to find a way around or manipulate the rules to change that.

There are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""ball"" rule seven steps to the right and two steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules to make the ball something else or make the wall passable.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right. If I can get to the door, maybe I can use it to reach the key or the ball. But the door is probably locked, so I need the key. But the key is a win condition, so maybe I can just reach it directly.

Let me check the positions again. The ball is two steps to the right and one step up. The key is seven steps to the right and one step down. The door is two steps to the right. So if I move right twice, I can reach the door. But is it open? I don't think so because the key is required.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the door passable without the key. For example, if I can change the door's property from ""stop"" to something else, I can walk through it.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the door's property. But how?

I think I need to move the ""stop"" rule block to the door's position. But to do that, I need to move the rule block. Since I'm Baba, and the rule blocks are text, I can move them if they're not fixed.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left and one step down. If I move left once and down once, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule. Then, I can move it to the door's position, which is two steps to the right. So, moving right twice from the ""stop"" rule's position would get it to the door.

But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move down once to pick it up.
3. Move right twice to place it over the door.

But wait, can I carry the rule block? In Baba Is You, you can move rule blocks by standing on them and then moving. So, if I move onto the ""stop"" rule, I can carry it.

So, step by step:

- Move left once: Now I'm at the ""stop"" rule.
- Move down once: Now I'm below the ""stop"" rule, but I need to pick it up. Maybe I need to move onto it first.
- Wait, perhaps I should move onto the ""stop"" rule by moving left once, then down once to pick it up.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ""stop"" rule by moving in the direction I want it to go while standing on it.

Let me try:

- Move left once: Now I'm on the ""stop"" rule.
- Move right once: This would move the ""stop"" rule to the right, but I need to move it to the door.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right from my starting position. So, if I'm on the ""stop"" rule, which is one step left and one step down, moving right twice would take it to the door's position.

But I'm not sure if I can move the rule block that way. Maybe I need to move onto it and then move in the desired direction.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the ""stop"" rule by moving it somewhere else, making the door passable.

Wait, if I remove the ""stop"" rule from the door, the door might no longer block me. So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I can walk through the door.

So, plan:

1. Move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move up once to pick it up.
3. Move it somewhere else, like up or down, to remove it from the door.

But I'm not sure if moving the ""stop"" rule will affect the door's property. Maybe the door's ""stop"" is defined by the rule block, so moving the rule block would change the door's property.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by rearranging the text blocks. For example, if I can make ""door is you,"" I can become the door and walk through it.

But that might be more complicated. Let me focus on the ""stop"" rule first.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the door, the door might no longer block me. So, I'll try to move the ""stop"" rule.

So, moving left once to get to the ""stop"" rule, then moving it up or down to remove it from the door's position.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the door might become passable. Then, I can move right twice to go through the door and reach the key or ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move right twice to reach the door, but it's blocked. So, I need to make it unblocked.

Another idea: If I can make the door ""win,"" then stepping on it would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""key is win."" So, if I can make the door ""win,"" that would work too. But I don't see a ""door is win"" rule block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door ""you,"" so I can become the door and walk through it. But that might not be necessary.

Let me think again. The key is seven steps to the right and one step down. The ball is two steps to the right and one step up. The door is two steps to the right.

If I can get through the door, I can reach the key or ball. But the door is blocking me. So, I need to make the door passable.

By moving the ""stop"" rule away, the door might no longer block me. So, I'll try that.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move up once to pick it up.
3. Move it somewhere else, like up or down, to remove it from the door's position.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the door is no longer ""stop,"" so I can walk through it.

Then, I can move right twice to go through the door and reach the key or ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move right twice and then up or down to reach the key or ball.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and one step up. So, if I move right twice and up once, I can reach the ball and win.

But the door is two steps to the right, so I need to go through it. If I can make the door passable, I can reach the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can go around the door. Let me check the map again.

The door is two steps to the right. There are walls around, so maybe I can't go around. So, the best bet is to make the door passable by moving the ""stop"" rule.

So, I'll proceed with moving the ""stop"" rule.

First, move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.

Then, move up once to pick it up.

Now, I'm carrying the ""stop"" rule. I can move it somewhere else, like up or down.

If I move up once, the ""stop"" rule is now one step up from its original position. That might be enough to make the door passable.

Then, I can move right twice to go through the door.

Once through the door, I can move up once to reach the ball and win.

Alternatively, I can move right seven steps to reach the key, but that's farther.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left once to get the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move up once to pick it up.
3. Move up once to place it somewhere else.
4. Move right twice to go through the door.
5. Move up once to reach the ball and win.

But I need to make sure that moving the ""stop"" rule actually makes the door passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ""stop"" rule to the side, and then the door is no longer blocked.

I think this is the best approach. So, the first action is to move left once to reach the ""stop"" rule.

That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach the key directly.

I see walls around, but I can move through them if I change the rules. The rules are made up of text blocks like ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" etc. If I can rearrange these, I can change the game's rules. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become impenetrable. But right now, I don't see that rule active, so maybe walls can be moved through.

I need to figure out how to get to the key or the ball. The key is seven steps to the right, but there's a door in the way. Maybe I can move the door's rule to make it passable without a key. Alternatively, I can try to reach the ball, which is two steps to the right and one step up. That seems closer.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and one step up. So if I move right twice and up once, I can reach it. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The map shows walls at various positions, but I'm not sure if they're in the way. Maybe I can move around them.

Alternatively, I can try to change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, then I can walk through them. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left and one step down. If I move that rule somewhere else, the walls won't stop me.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get to the ""stop"" rule. It's one step to the left and one step down from my current position. So I can move left once and down once to reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else, like further down, so the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property.

Once the walls aren't stopping me, I can move through them to reach the key or the ball. The ball is closer, so maybe I should go for that first. After reaching the ball, I win the level.

But wait, I also have the door two steps to the right. If I can open the door, maybe there's a shortcut. Doors usually require keys, but if I can change the door's rule, I might not need the key. For example, if I make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through without the key.

To change the door's rule, I need to move the ""door"" rule block. It's nine steps to the right and four steps down. That's pretty far. Maybe it's better to focus on the ball first since it's closer.

So, my plan is: move left once and down once to get the ""stop"" rule, then move it somewhere else to make walls passable. After that, move right twice and up once to reach the ball and win.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can only move one step at a time. I need to make sure each move is valid and doesn't hit any walls unless I've changed the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it something else, but that might complicate things. It's better to stick with making walls passable.

So, first move: left once to start getting to the ""stop"" rule.

That means if I can get to either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba around to achieve this.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door 3 steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But first, I need to figure out how to get the key or the ball.

The ball is located 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. The key is 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. The door is 3 steps to the right. There are also walls and other rule blocks scattered around.

I notice that the rule blocks are arranged in a line to the right. The ""ball"" rule is 8 steps right and 2 up, ""is"" is 9 steps right and 2 up, and ""win"" is 10 steps right and 2 up. Similarly, the ""key"" rule is 8 steps right and 1 down, ""is"" is 9 steps right and 1 down, and ""win"" is 10 steps right and 1 down. The ""baba"" rule is 4 steps down, ""is"" is 1 step right and 4 down, and ""you"" is 2 steps right and 4 down.

I think I need to manipulate these rule blocks to change the rules in my favor. Maybe I can move the ""key"" or ""ball"" rule blocks to make them win conditions or to make myself able to move through walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can make walls passable. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key or the ball. The door is in the way, so maybe I can open it by getting the key. To get the key, I need to move right 8 steps and down 1. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break a rule to make the walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule to make the key a win condition, but I already have that. Hmm.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba. So I can move Baba to the right to reach the door. But the door is 3 steps right. Let me try moving right three times to get to the door. But the door is closed, so I need the key.

So I need to get the key first. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. But to get there, I have to pass through walls. Maybe I can change the rules to make walls passable.

Looking at the rule blocks, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe the walls won't stop me. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step down. If I move it somewhere else, perhaps the walls become passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls into something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step down. If I move it to the side, maybe the walls won't stop me. Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule to the right or left.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. It's 1 step down, so I need to move down once. But moving down might take me into the wall. Unless I can make the walls passable first.

This is a bit tricky. Maybe I should try moving right to get closer to the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key,"" so I can pick up the key by being on it. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me try moving right to get closer to the door and see if I can manipulate the rules from there. So, I'll move right three times to reach the door. But the door is closed, so I need the key.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. So, perhaps I need to get the ball or the key.

The ball is 3 steps right and 1 up. Maybe I can move up to get it. Let me try moving right three times and then up once. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Looking at the map, there's a wall 5 steps right and 1 up. So, moving right three times would take me to 3 steps right, then up once would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is the door. Wait, no, the door is 3 steps right and 0 up. So, moving up from there would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is the wall.

Hmm, maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to make it passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 step down, to make walls not stop me. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point) would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable first.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by being on it. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's an ""is"" rule 1 step right and 1 up. If I can move that to be next to ""baba,"" which is 4 steps down, then I can create ""baba is key.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 right and 1 up to 4 down. That seems far. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to make something else a win condition. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win. Let me see where the ""win"" rules are. There's a ""win"" rule 10 steps right and 2 up, and another 10 steps right and 1 down.

If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""door,"" which is 10 steps right and 4 down, then I can make ""door is win."" But that's a long way to move the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make it a win condition. The ""door"" rule is 10 steps right and 4 down. If I can move it next to ""win,"" then I can create ""door is win.""

This seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there.

So, I'll move right once, then right again, and again. Each time, I'll check if I can move further or if I need to manipulate a rule.

After moving right three times, I'm at the door. But it's closed, so I need the key. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from the door would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step down from the starting point. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe the walls won't stop me. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from the starting point would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable first.

This is a bit of a catch-22. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think about the rules again. ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" ""baba is you."" So, I can win by getting either the ball or the key.

The ball is 3 steps right and 1 up. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. The door is 3 steps right. So, maybe I can go up to get the ball, then use it to win.

But to get to the ball, I need to move right three times and up once. Let me try that. So, right, right, right, up. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Looking at the map, after moving right three times, I'm at 3 right. Then up once would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is the door. Wait, no, the door is at 3 right and 0 up. So, moving up from there would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is the wall.

Hmm, maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to make it passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 step down, to make walls not stop me. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point) would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable first.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try moving right to get closer to the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there.

So, I'll move right once, then right again, and again. Each time, I'll check if I can move further or if I need to manipulate a rule.

After moving right three times, I'm at the door. But it's closed, so I need the key. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from the door would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the side. Let me try moving right once from the door to get to 4 right. Then, I can move down once to get to the ""stop"" rule at 4 right and 1 down. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by being on it. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's an ""is"" rule 1 step right and 1 up. If I can move that to be next to ""baba,"" which is 4 steps down, then I can create ""baba is key.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 right and 1 up to 4 down. That seems far. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to make something else a win condition. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win. Let me see where the ""win"" rules are. There's a ""win"" rule 10 steps right and 2 up, and another 10 steps right and 1 down.

If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""door,"" which is 10 steps right and 4 down, then I can make ""door is win."" But that's a long way to move the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make it a win condition. The ""door"" rule is 10 steps right and 4 down. If I can move it next to ""win,"" then I can create ""door is win.""

This seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there.

So, I'll move right once, then right again, and again. Each time, I'll check if I can move further or if I need to manipulate a rule.

After moving right three times, I'm at the door. But it's closed, so I need the key. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from the door would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step down from the starting point. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe the walls won't stop me. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from the starting point would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable first.

This is a bit of a catch-22. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think about the rules again. ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" ""baba is you."" So, I can win by getting either the ball or the key.

The ball is 3 steps right and 1 up. The key is 8 steps right and 1 down. The door is 3 steps right. So, maybe I can go up to get the ball, then use it to win.

But to get to the ball, I need to move right three times and up once. Let me try that. So, right, right, right, up. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Looking at the map, after moving right three times, I'm at 3 right. Then up once would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is the door. Wait, no, the door is at 3 right and 0 up. So, moving up from there would take me to 3 right and 1 up, which is the wall.

Hmm, maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, maybe I can move the wall rule to make it passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 step down, to make walls not stop me. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point) would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable first.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try moving right to get closer to the key and see if I can manipulate the rules from there.

So, I'll move right once, then right again, and again. Each time, I'll check if I can move further or if I need to manipulate a rule.

After moving right three times, I'm at the door. But it's closed, so I need the key. Let me try moving down once to get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving down from the door would take me into the wall. Unless I can make the wall passable.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the side. Let me try moving right once from the door to get to 4 right. Then, I can move down once to get to the ""stop"" rule at 4 right and 1 down. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it a win condition, but it's already a win condition. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by being on it. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach those objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door 3 steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But first, I need to figure out how to get the key or the ball.

I see a wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There are also rule blocks for ""ball,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" at 8, 9, and 10 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That seems like a line of rule blocks that I might be able to move. If I can move these rule blocks, I could potentially change the rules to make the key or ball reachable.

The ball is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's closer than the key, which is 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I should try to get the ball first since it's closer. But I need to check if there are any walls or obstacles blocking my path.

There's a wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might be in the way. If I can move that wall, I could clear the path to the ball. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the wall passable or remove it.

I also notice a ""stop"" rule 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to prevent myself from being stopped by walls. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Another thing is the door 3 steps to the right. If I can get the key, I can open the door, but I need to reach the key first. The key is 8 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is quite far. Maybe I can find a way to move the key closer or change the rules so that I can reach it without moving so much.

Wait, the rule blocks for ""key"" are 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move those, I could potentially create a new rule that makes the key winnable or changes its position. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best approach is to try to move the rule blocks to create a new rule that allows me to reach the ball or the key. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could become the key and reach the door. Or maybe make ""ball is you"" so I can collect it directly.

Let me try to move the ""ball"" rule block. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I could create a new rule like ""ball is win."" But that's already an active rule. Maybe I need to break that rule or create a different one.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" block to create a new subject-property pair. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to make ""baba is key."" That way, I could collect the key by moving onto it.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. I need to check the positions of the rule blocks. The ""ball"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 up, ""is"" is at 9 steps right and 2 up, and ""win"" is at 10 steps right and 2 up. If I can move the ""is"" block to the left, I could create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" block is also at 1 step right and 1 up, and 9 steps right and 1 down. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block from 9 steps right and 2 up to somewhere else. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think I need to start by moving towards the rule blocks to see if I can rearrange them. Let me try moving right to get closer to the rule blocks. If I move right, I can start moving the ""is"" block to create a new rule.

So, I'll choose to move right to get closer to the rule blocks and see if I can create a new rule that helps me win the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need the key to get through. But wait, the key is also a win condition, so maybe I can just reach the key directly.

I see walls around, which are probably blocking my path. The rules are laid out in the upper part of the map, with ""ball,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" etc., each in their own blocks. Maybe I can rearrange these rules to make things easier.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The door is two steps to the right, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can break the wall by changing the rules. If I can make the wall into something else, like a pushable block, I might be able to move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule so that the wall becomes ""stop,"" which would make it immovable. But that doesn't seem helpful. Wait, if I can make the wall into ""you,"" then I could control it, but that might complicate things.

Another idea: if I can make the door into ""win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level. But the door is already a separate object, so maybe that's not the way.

Let me think about the key. The key is a win condition, so if I can reach it, I win. It's located seven steps to the right and one step down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left and one step down. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to the key's position, maybe I can prevent the key from being a win condition. But that doesn't help me win.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make it ""you,"" so I can control the key. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Let me look at the door again. If I can open the door, maybe I can reach the key or the ball on the other side. To open the door, I might need the key, but since the key is a win condition, maybe I can just reach it without needing the door.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right. If I can move right twice, I might be able to reach it. But there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the wall to the side by changing the rules.

If I can make the wall into ""push,"" then I could push it out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, if I can make the wall into ""you,"" I could control it, but that might not be useful.

Another approach: since the ball is a win condition, maybe I can move the ball to where I am. The ball is two steps to the right and one step up. If I can move the ball down, I could reach it.

Wait, the ball is also a rule block. Maybe I can change the rule so that the ball becomes something else. For example, if I can make the ball into ""you,"" I could control it, but that might not help me win.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball into ""stop,"" it would block movement, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" So, both the ball and the key are win conditions. I just need to reach either one.

The key is seven steps to the right and one step down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. The door is two steps to the right, so maybe I can go through the door to reach the key.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move the wall to the side by changing the rules. If I can make the wall into ""push,"" I could push it out of the way, but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall into ""you,"" I could control it, but that might not help me reach the key.

Another idea: if I can make the door into ""win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, the door is a rule block as well. Maybe I can change the door's rule to make it a win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the door, then stepping on the door would win the level.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and two steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move it closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into ""you,"" so I can control it and move it to the key or the ball.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right. If I can make the door into ""you,"" I could move it to the key's location, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: since the key is a win condition, maybe I can move the key to where I am. The key is seven steps to the right and one step down. If I can move the key closer, I could reach it.

But how do I move the key? The key is a rule block, so I can move it by changing the rules.

Wait, the key's rule is ""key is win."" If I can change that to ""key is you,"" I could control the key and move it towards me.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""key is you.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to the key's position, making it ""key is you.""

But I'm not sure how to execute that.

Let me think about the ""you"" rule. It's three steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to the key's position, then the key would become ""you,"" and I could control it.

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? It's three steps down, so I need to move it up.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move around. If I can get to the ""you"" rule, I can pick it up and move it to the key's location.

But the ""you"" rule is three steps down, which might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is, making ""key is you.""

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the door is two steps to the right, maybe I can go through it by making the door into ""win."" Then, stepping on the door would win the level.

But I need to change the door's rule to ""win."" The door's rule is ""door is win,"" but it's located nine steps to the right and four steps down. That's too far.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right, but the rule for the door is ""door is win"" nine steps to the right and four steps down. So, the door itself is two steps to the right, but its rule is far away.

Maybe I can move the door's rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the door's position, then the door would become a win condition.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? It's nine steps to the right and two steps up. That's quite far.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door two steps to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. There's also a wall four steps to the right and two steps up, which might block my path. The ball is two steps to the right and one step up, and the key is seven steps to the right and one step down. Hmm, that's a bit far.

I notice there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""stop"" rule one step to the left and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls stop me or something else. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the ball or key faster.

Wait, the door is two steps to the right. If I can get through the door, maybe it leads to a shortcut or a different area where the ball or key is closer. But to open the door, I might need a key. However, the key is seven steps to the right and one step down, which is quite a distance. Maybe there's a way to change the rules so that the door doesn't require a key or so that I can pass through it without one.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the ball or key come to me. For example, if I can create a new rule like ""ball is you,"" I could control the ball and move it towards me. But I'm not sure how to do that with the current setup.

Let me think about the positions again. The ball is two steps to the right and one up. That's relatively close. If I can move towards it, maybe I can reach it quickly. But there's a wall four steps to the right and two up, which might be in the way. Maybe I can move the wall or change its properties.

Wait, the wall is four steps to the right and two up. If I can move the wall to the left or down, I might clear the path to the ball. But how? I need to find the rule blocks related to the wall. There's a ""wall"" rule one step to the left and one step up. If I move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make the wall immovable, but that doesn't seem helpful. Or perhaps ""wall is push"" to make it movable. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current rules.

Another idea: since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. If I move Baba to the right, I can get closer to the ball or the door. Let's see, moving right would take me towards the ball and the door. Maybe I should try moving right first to see what happens.

If I move right, I'll be one step closer to the ball and the door. Then, I can assess whether to go for the ball or try to open the door. If the door is blocking the path to the key, maybe I need to get the key first, but it's quite far.

Wait, the key is seven steps to the right and one step down. That's a long way. Maybe it's better to go for the ball first since it's closer. But I need to make sure there's a clear path.

Looking back, the wall is four steps to the right and two up. If I move right, I might hit the wall. Unless I can move the wall out of the way. How can I do that? Maybe by changing the wall's rule.

There's a ""wall"" rule one step to the left and one step up. If I move that rule block, perhaps I can change the wall's properties. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""push,"" I can create a new rule like ""wall is push,"" making the wall movable.

But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule block. Let me see where it is. It's one step to the left and one step up. So, if I move left and up, I can reach it. But I'm currently at the starting position, so moving left might not be possible if there's a wall or another obstacle.

Wait, the starting position is where Baba is. Let me check the objects again. There's a wall four steps to the right and two up, but nothing to the left except the ""wall"" rule block. So, maybe I can move left to get to the ""wall"" rule.

If I move left, I can reach the ""wall"" rule. Then, I can move it to create a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""is"" and ""push"" to make ""wall is push."" That way, the wall becomes movable, and I can push it out of the way.

Once the wall is movable, I can push it down or to the side, clearing the path to the ball. Then, I can move right to reach the ball and win the level.

So, the plan is: move left to get the ""wall"" rule, then move it to create ""wall is push,"" then push the wall out of the way, and finally move right to reach the ball.

But wait, moving left might take me away from the ball. Maybe there's a quicker way. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to make the wall stop me, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Another thought: if I can make the ball come to me by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and move it towards me. But I'm not sure how to do that with the current rule blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" but that's already the case since ""baba is you"" and ""you"" is the player. Wait, no, ""baba is you"" means I control Baba, but the win condition is still reaching the ball or key.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to move right first and see if I can reach the ball without dealing with the wall. If the wall is in the way, then I'll have to find a way to move it.

So, I'll try moving right. If that doesn't work, I'll adjust my plan.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach those objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door one step to the right. Doors usually require keys to open, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. There's also a wall three steps to the right and two steps up, which might block my path. The ball is one step to the right and one step up, so it's pretty close. The key is six steps to the right and one step down, which is a bit further away.

I notice that there are several rule blocks scattered around. For example, there's a ""stop"" rule two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls stop me or something else. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Since the ball is closer, maybe I should go for that first. But wait, the door is right next to me. If I move right, I'll be next to the door. Maybe I can open it to get to the key or the ball. But without a key, I might not be able to open the door. Hmm.

Alternatively, I could try to move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""win,"" maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that to a wall, maybe I can make the walls stop me, which could help me navigate better. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since the ball is one step up and one step right, maybe I should move right first to get closer to the door and the ball.

If I move right, I'll be next to the door. Then, maybe I can move up to reach the ball. But I'm not sure if the door is blocking me. If the door is closed, I might need a key to open it. But since the key is further away, maybe I should try to get the ball first.

Alternatively, if I move up first, I might hit a wall. Let me check the map again. There's a wall three steps to the right and two steps up. So if I move up, I might not hit a wall immediately. Maybe I can move up and then right to reach the ball.

Wait, the ball is one step to the right and one step up from my current position. So if I move right and then up, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall three steps to the right and two steps up. So if I move right once, I'm at position (1,0). Then moving up would take me to (1,1), which is where the ball is. So that should work.

But wait, there's a door one step to the right. So if I move right, I'm next to the door. Maybe I need to open the door first. But without a key, I can't open it. So maybe I should go up first to avoid the door.

If I move up, I go to (0,1). Then moving right would take me to (1,1), where the ball is. That seems possible. But I need to check if there's a wall in the way. The wall is three steps to the right and two steps up, so at (3,2). So moving up and then right shouldn't hit that wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right first to get to the door, and then see if I can open it somehow. But without a key, I can't open the door, so that might not help.

Another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can make the walls stop me, which might help me navigate better. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I can move left twice and down once to get to the ""stop"" rule, but that seems like a detour.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps to the left and one step down. So from my current position, moving left twice and down once would get me there. But that's a bit far, and I'm not sure if it's necessary right now.

I think the best course of action is to move right first to get closer to the ball and the door. Then, I can decide whether to go up to get the ball or try to open the door if possible.

So, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are ""ball is win,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means if I can reach either the ball or the key, I'll win. Also, I'm controlling Baba, so I need to move Baba to reach one of those.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall two steps to the right and two steps up. Then there are some rule blocks: ""ball"" is five steps right and two up, ""is"" is six right and two up, ""win"" is seven right and two up. There's also a ""wall"" rule one step left and one up, and another ""is"" rule two left and one up. The ball is just one step up, which is pretty close. There's a wall two right and one up, and another wall two right. The ""stop"" rule is three left and one down, which might be a block I can't move through. There's a key five right and one down, and some other rules and walls.

I need to figure out how to get to the ball or the key. The ball is only one step up, so maybe I can move up once to reach it. But wait, there's a wall two steps to the right and two up. If I move up, will that wall block me? Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, moving up once would take me to where the ball is. But is there a wall in the way? The wall is two right and two up, so if I'm moving straight up, maybe I can avoid it.

Alternatively, maybe I should move right first to get around the wall. If I move right twice, I might be able to go around the wall and then up to reach the ball. But I need to check if there are any other obstacles. There's a ""stop"" rule three left and one down, which might be a block that stops me, but I'm not sure if that's in my path.

Another thought: the key is five right and one down. That's further away, but maybe it's easier to reach. I can move right five times and then down once. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking that path. The walls are at two right and two up, two right and one up, and two right. So moving right five times might be possible if there are no walls in the way beyond two right.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is three left and one down. That's to the left, so if I'm moving right, I might not encounter it. Let me plan my path. If I move right five times, I'll be at five right. Then down once would take me to five right and one down, where the key is. That seems possible.

But I also have the option to reach the ball by moving up once. Let me check if that's possible. If I move up once, I should be at the ball's position. But is there a wall blocking me? The wall is two right and two up, so if I'm moving up from my starting position, I should be able to reach the ball without hitting the wall.

Wait, but the ball is one step up, and the wall is two right and two up. So moving up once would take me to the ball, which is directly above me. That seems straightforward. So maybe I can just move up once to win.

But I should also consider the rules. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""key is win,"" so either one will work. If I can reach the ball quickly, that's the easiest path. So I think moving up once is the best action here.
