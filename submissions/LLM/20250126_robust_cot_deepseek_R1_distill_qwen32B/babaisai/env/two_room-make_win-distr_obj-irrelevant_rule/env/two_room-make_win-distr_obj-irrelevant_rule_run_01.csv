Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, and some other items. Let me list them out to get a clearer picture.

First, the walls are positioned at various points. There's a wall two steps right and four up, another two right and three up, two right and two up, two right and one up, two right, two right and one down, and two right and two down. So, there's a vertical line of walls on the right side, maybe forming a barrier.

Then, there are several rule blocks. The rules are:
- ""is"" at 6 right, 4 up
- ""win"" at 7 right, 4 up
- ""wall"" at 3 left, 3 up
- ""is"" at 2 left, 3 up
- ""stop"" at 2 left, 2 up
- ""door"" at 3 right, 2 up
- ""key"" at 5 right, 2 up
- ""baba"" at 3 left, 2 down
- ""is"" at 2 left, 2 down
- ""you"" at 1 left, 2 down

Additionally, there's a ball at 1 left, 3 up, and a key at 2 left, 1 down.

So, the initial position is where I am, and I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The walls are in the way, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to change that.

Looking at the rules, I see ""stop"" at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make something stop or not stop. Also, there's a ""door"" and ""key"" rule. Maybe I can create a door and key to unlock something.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 4 up. That's far to the right. Maybe I need to reach that to win. But there are walls blocking the way. Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition.

I also notice a ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 2 down, and ""you"" at 1 left, 2 down. If I can move these, I might be able to change who I am or what I can do.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to choose one action. Since I'm starting, maybe I should move towards the rules I can manipulate.

Looking at the key at 2 left, 1 down. That's below me, so maybe I can move down to pick it up. But wait, do I need the key for something? There's a ""key"" rule at 5 right, 2 up. Maybe if I can create a key, I can open a door.

Alternatively, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move that, I might be able to make something stop moving or prevent movement. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the ball is at 1 left, 3 up. Maybe I can push it somewhere, but I don't know if that's useful yet.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and I need to figure out the layout. The walls are on the right, so maybe I can go left or up. But the ""stop"" rule is to the left and up, so maybe moving left is blocked? Or maybe not, because ""stop"" is a rule, not a wall.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 2 up. So if I can move that, I can change what stops movement. Maybe I can make walls stop me or not.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I can move ""win"" next to something else, I can change the win condition.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the immediate steps. I need to move towards a rule block to change it. The closest rule blocks are ""stop"" at 2 left, 2 up, and ""is"" at 2 left, 3 up. Maybe I can move up to get closer.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me see: the ball is at 1 left, 3 up. So if I move up three times, I can reach the ball. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, moving left might be better. The ""stop"" rule is two left and two up. So if I move left twice and up twice, I can reach it. But that's a bit far. Maybe I should move up first to get closer.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. So if I move up three times and left twice, I can reach it. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I should move towards the key first.

The key is at 2 left, 1 down. So if I move down once and left twice, I can get the key. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 2 down. If I can move that, I can change what Baba is. For example, making Baba into a key or something else.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 2 down. So if I move down twice and left three times, I can reach it. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I should move down first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get past the walls, but the walls are on the right, so that might not be possible unless I can change the wall rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 3 up. So if I can move that, I can change what a wall is. For example, making walls stop or not stop.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. My current position: I'm at the starting point, which I'll consider as (0,0) for simplicity.
2. The walls are positioned at various points, but the key ones are on the right, forming a barrier.
3. The ""win"" rule is far to the right, so maybe I need to reach that.
4. The ""stop"" rule is at (-2, 2), so two left and two up.
5. The ""key"" rule is at (5, 2), which is far to the right.
6. The ""door"" rule is at (3, 2), also to the right.
7. The ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -2), three left and two down.
8. The ""you"" rule is at (-1, -2), one left and two down.

So, perhaps I can create a door and key to unlock the path to the win. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" and ""key"" rules next to each other or something.

Alternatively, I can change the win condition to something else, like making the ball the win condition.

Wait, the ball is at (-1, 3). If I can make the ball the win condition, I can just reach it. But how?

I need to create a rule like ""ball is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" subject next to ""is"" and ""win.""

But the ""ball"" is an object, not a rule. So I can't directly move it. Wait, no, the ""ball"" is an object, but the rules are separate. So I can't change the ball's properties unless I create a new rule.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at (-1, 3). The ""is"" rule is at (-2, 3). So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can create a new rule ""ball is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the ball's position, making ""ball is [something].""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, making ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me think about the immediate steps. I need to choose one action. Since I'm starting, maybe I should move towards a rule block I can manipulate.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule at (-2, 2), if I can move that, I can change what stops movement. Maybe I can make walls stop me or not.

Alternatively, moving towards the ""is"" rule at (-2, 3) could allow me to create new rules.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (-2, 3). If I can move that next to another rule, I can create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, I'm at (0,0). The ""is"" rule is at (-2, 3). So to get there, I need to move left twice and up three times. That's a lot, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move towards the ""key"" at (-2, -1). If I can get the key, maybe I can open a door.

But I'm not sure if there's a door yet. The ""door"" rule is at (3, 2), so I'd need to create a door somewhere.

Wait, maybe I can create a door by moving the ""door"" rule next to a wall or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into a key by moving the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba.""

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -2). If I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba,"" I can make ""baba is key,"" which would let me open doors.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the steps.

1. Move towards the ""key"" rule at (5, 2). Wait, that's far to the right. Maybe not.

Alternatively, the ""key"" object is at (-2, -1). So if I can move down once and left twice, I can get the key.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Wait, maybe I should move towards the ""stop"" rule at (-2, 2). If I can move that, I can change what stops movement. For example, making walls stop me or not.

If I can make walls not stop me, I can walk through them. That would be helpful.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me.

Wait, but I want to make walls not stop me. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule like ""wall is not stop.""

But how?

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (-2, 2). If I can move that next to a wall, I can make that wall stop me. But I want the opposite.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to something else, like ""you,"" I can make ""you is stop,"" which would stop me.

But that's not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the immediate action.

I need to choose one action. Since I'm starting, maybe I should move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (-2, 3). So moving up would get me closer. Let me try moving up.

But wait, I'm at (0,0). Moving up once would take me to (0,1). Then up again to (0,2), and again to (0,3). Then I can move left twice to reach (-2,3), where the ""is"" rule is.

But that's three up moves and two left moves. That's a lot, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I should move left first to get closer to the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (-2, 2). So moving left twice and up twice would get me there.

But I'm not sure if that's the best first move.

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the key at (-2, -1). So moving down once and left twice.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Wait, perhaps the key is needed to open a door. The ""door"" rule is at (3, 2). So if I can create a door, I might need a key to open it.

But I'm not sure how to create a door yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the win condition. The ball is at (-1, 3). If I can make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would win the level.

To do that, I need to create the rule ""ball is win."" That would require moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule.

But the ""is"" rule is at (-2, 3), and the ball is at (-1, 3). So if I can move the ""is"" rule to (-1, 3), making ""ball is [something],"" but I need the ""win"" rule next to it.

The ""win"" rule is at (7,4). That's far away. So maybe that's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. But that's also far.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think about the possible first move.

I think the best first move is to move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. So I'll choose ""up.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's mechanics in my favor.

First, I should note the positions of all the important elements. The ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far, so I might need to create a path or change some rules to get there. The ""key"" is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down, which is closer. There's also a ""door"" rule 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe the door is blocking my path, and I need the key to open it.

I see a ""stop"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls passable. The ""ball"" is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things.

I also notice multiple ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules. For example, if I can move an ""is"" next to another object, I can redefine its properties. The ""baba"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use these to change what Baba is or create a new identity.

Let me think about the immediate area. I'm starting at the origin, and I need to move towards the key or the door. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but perhaps I can break through them by changing their properties.

If I move left twice and up once, I can reach the ""stop"" rule. If I can move that, maybe I can make a wall stop me, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, if I can make a wall into something else, like a ""move"" or ""push,"" that could help me navigate.

Wait, the ""ball"" is nearby. If I can make the ball into a ""push"" object, I could push walls out of the way. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, if I can make a wall into a ""move"" object, I could move it.

Looking at the rules, I see a ""wall"" rule 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that, I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is move,"" then walls can be moved, which would help clear a path.

But to do that, I need to get to the ""wall"" rule and an ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. So, if I move left twice and up twice, I can reach the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it next to the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule like ""wall is move.""

Alternatively, I could try to make the ball into a key or something else. The key is 2 steps left and 2 down, so maybe I can get there first. If I can pick up the key, I can open the door, which is 3 steps right and 1 up. But to get to the key, I might need to move through some walls, which I can't do unless I change the rules.

Another approach: the ""win"" rule is far away, but maybe I can redefine the win condition. If I can make something else into the win condition, I might not have to go all the way to the current win object. For example, if I can make the key into the win condition, then picking up the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The ""win"" rule is 7 right and 3 up, which is quite a distance. Alternatively, I can bring the key next to the ""win"" rule, but that might be complicated.

Let me think about the immediate steps. I'm at the origin. If I move left twice and up once, I can reach the ""stop"" rule. But I don't see an immediate use for that. Alternatively, moving up twice and left twice would get me to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move that ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule to make ""wall is move.""

So, the plan is: move left twice, up twice to get the ""is"" rule, then move it next to the ""wall"" rule. That would allow me to move walls, which could clear a path towards the key or the door.

But wait, moving the ""is"" rule requires that I can move it. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but the ""is"" rule is an object. Are ""is"" rules movable? I think they are, as long as they aren't defined as ""stop"" or something. So, I can move the ""is"" rule.

So, step by step:

1. Move left twice to reach column -2.
2. Move up twice to reach row 2.
3. Now, I'm at the ""is"" rule. I can pick it up.
4. Then, move it next to the ""wall"" rule, which is 3 left and 2 up from the origin. Wait, no, the ""wall"" rule is 3 left and 2 up from where? Let me check the objects again.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps up from the origin. So, from the origin, moving left 3 and up 2 would get me there. But I'm already at left 2 and up 2. So, I need to move left one more step to reach the ""wall"" rule.

So, after picking up the ""is"" rule at (-2, 2), I can move left one more step to (-3, 2), where the ""wall"" rule is. Then, placing the ""is"" next to it would create the rule ""wall is [something]."" But I need to decide what to make it. If I can make ""wall is move,"" then walls can be moved.

But how do I create that rule? I need to have the ""move"" property. Do I have a ""move"" rule? Looking at the objects, I don't see a ""move"" rule listed. Hmm, that's a problem. Without a ""move"" rule, I can't make walls movable.

Alternatively, maybe I can make walls into something else, like ""push"" or ""win."" But without the necessary rules, that might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by combining existing elements. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become controllable, but that might not help. Alternatively, ""wall is stop"" would make walls stop me, which is the default, so that's not useful.

Maybe I should look for another approach. The key is 2 left and 2 down. If I can get there, I can pick up the key. Then, the door is 3 right and 1 up. If I have the key, maybe I can open the door.

But to get to the key, I need to move down, but there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls around me. From the origin, moving down, there's a wall 2 right and 1 down. So, directly below me, to the right, there's a wall. That might block my path.

Alternatively, maybe I can go around. Let me see the layout. To the right, there are walls at various positions, but perhaps I can find a path.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 1 left and 2 up. If I can get the ball, maybe I can use it to break through walls. But I don't see a ""break"" rule, so that might not work.

Another idea: the ""baba"" rule is 3 left and 3 down. If I can move that, I can change what Baba is. For example, making ""baba is key"" would allow me to pick up the key without needing to move there. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, making ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition, so I would win immediately. But I don't see a ""win"" rule near me, so that might not be feasible.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 7 right and 3 up. That's quite far, but if I can redefine the win condition, I might not need to go all the way there.

Let me think again about the ""is"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is key,"" then the ball would act as a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the actual key.

But I need to get to the ""ball"" first. The ball is 1 left and 2 up. So, from the origin, moving left once and up twice would get me there. But I need to check if the path is clear.

From the origin, moving left once would take me to (-1, 0). Then, moving up twice would take me to (-1, 2). Is there a wall blocking that path? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 2 right and 3 up, which is (2,3). Another wall 2 right and 2 up (2,2). So, my path to (-1,2) seems clear.

So, I can move left once, then up twice to reach the ball. Then, I can pick up the ball. But how does that help me? Unless I can make the ball into a key or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push walls. But without a ""push"" rule, that might not work.

Wait, perhaps I can make the ball into a ""move"" object. If I can create a rule like ""ball is move,"" then I can move the ball, but I still need to figure out how that helps.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible steps again:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (-2,2).
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule at (-3,2) to create ""wall is [something].""
3. But without a ""move"" rule, I can't make walls movable.

Alternatively:

1. Move to the ""ball"" at (-1,2).
2. Pick up the ball.
3. Then, move to the ""is"" rule at (-2,2).
4. Create a new rule with the ball and ""is.""

But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, maybe I can make the ball into a ""key."" If I can create ""ball is key,"" then the ball would act as a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the actual key.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball. So, I can move the ""is"" rule from (-2,2) to (-1,2), where the ball is. Then, the rule would be ""ball is [something]."" But I need to have the ""key"" rule nearby to make it ""ball is key.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 5 right and 1 up. So, it's at (5,1). That's far from the ball. So, that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ball. But the ""key"" rule is at (5,1), which is far away. I don't think I can reach it quickly.

Another idea: the ""door"" rule is 3 right and 1 up. So, at (3,1). If I can make the door into something else, like ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. But I need to get to the door first.

But to get to the door, I might need to pass through walls, which I can't do unless I change the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. So, at (-2,1). If I can move that, maybe I can make walls stop me, but that's the default. Alternatively, making ""stop is move"" would allow me to move through stop objects, but I don't see a ""move"" rule.

I'm going in circles. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is at (-2,-2). To get there, I need to move left twice and down twice. But are there walls blocking that path?

From the origin, moving left twice would take me to (-2,0). Then, moving down twice would take me to (-2,-2), where the key is. Let me check if there are walls in that area. There's a wall at (2,-1) and (2,-2). So, to the right, but not directly in my path. So, the path to (-2,-2) seems clear.

So, I can move left twice and down twice to pick up the key. Then, I can go to the door at (3,1). But to get from (-2,-2) to (3,1), I need to move right five steps and up three steps. But there are walls in the way. For example, at (2,3), (2,2), etc.

Unless I can change the rules to make walls passable, I can't get through. So, perhaps after picking up the key, I need to change the rules to make walls movable or passable.

But how? I need to create a rule that changes walls. So, maybe after getting the key, I should go back and create a rule like ""wall is move.""

Wait, but I need the ""is"" rule and the ""wall"" rule to do that. The ""is"" rule is at (-2,2), and the ""wall"" rule is at (-3,2). So, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to make ""wall is [something].""

But again, without a ""move"" rule, I can't make walls movable. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make walls into ""key"" or ""win."" If I make ""wall is win,"" then any wall I step on would win the level. But that might not be helpful unless I can step on a wall, which I can't do normally.

Wait, but if I can make walls into ""you,"" then I can control them. So, ""wall is you"" would make walls controllable, allowing me to move them. But I don't see a ""you"" rule nearby. The ""you"" rule is at (-1,-3). So, that's far.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule.

I'm stuck again. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, making ""key is win"" would mean that picking up the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The ""win"" rule is at (7,3), which is far. Alternatively, I can move the key next to the ""win"" rule, but that's also far.

Wait, maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule by combining other elements. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I need to have the ""win"" rule nearby to do that.

The ""win"" rule is at (7,3). So, I need to move it next to Baba. But that's a long distance, and I might not be able to do that without changing other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" If I can create that rule, then picking up the ball would win the level. But I need to have the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

The ball is at (-1,2). The ""win"" rule is at (7,3). So, that's not feasible.

I'm not making progress. Let me try to outline the steps I can take:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (-2,2).
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule at (-3,2) to create ""wall is [something].""
3. But without a ""move"" rule, I can't make walls movable.

Alternatively:

1. Move to the key at (-2,-2).
2. Pick up the key.
3. Then, try to get to the door at (3,1), but walls block the way.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to open the door without needing to change the rules. If I pick up the key and then go to the door, perhaps the door will open automatically.

But I need to check if the door is locked. The ""door"" rule is at (3,1), and the ""key"" rule is at (5,1). So, the door is at (3,1), and the key is at (-2,-2). I need to bring the key next to the door to open it.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left twice and down twice to pick up the key at (-2,-2).
2. Then, move right five steps and up three steps to reach the door at (3,1).
3. Place the key next to the door to open it.

But wait, moving from (-2,-2) to (3,1) requires moving right 5 and up 3. Let me check the path. From (-2,-2), moving right to (3,-2), then up to (3,1). Are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at (2,-1) and (2,-2). So, when I move right from (-2,-2), I'll pass through ( -1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2), (2,-2) which is a wall. So, I can't move right past (2,-2) because it's a wall.

Therefore, I need to find another way. Maybe I can go up first to avoid the wall. From (-2,-2), move up to (-2,-1), then right to (3,-1), then up to (3,1). Let me check if that path is clear.

From (-2,-2) to (-2,-1): that's moving up one step. Then, moving right to (3,-1): are there walls in the way? Let me see. There's a wall at","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The rules are spread out, so maybe I can move some of them to change the game's mechanics.

First, I should note where the key is. It's two steps to the left and two steps down. That might be important because keys often open doors. There's also a door three steps to the right and one step up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

But before I can do that, I need to see if I can move around freely. The walls are placed in such a way that they might be blocking my path. Let me see: walls are two steps to the right and three steps up, two steps to the right and two steps up, etc. It seems like the walls are creating a sort of barrier on the right side.

I also notice there are several rule blocks. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at six steps right and three up, and a ""rule `win`"" at seven steps right and three up. Maybe if I can move these rule blocks, I can change the rules of the game to make things easier.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is two steps left and one step up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make something stop moving or become immovable. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

The ball is one step left and two steps up. Balls in Baba Is You often have specific behaviors, like pushing or being pushed. Maybe I can use the ball to help me move something else.

I think the key is the most important here. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me to the win condition. So, how do I get to the key? It's two steps left and two steps down. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: I'm at the origin (0,0).
- The key is at (-2, -2). So, I need to move left twice and down twice.

But are there walls blocking that path? Let me check the walls:

- Walls are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3). So, on the right side, there are walls from y=3 down to y=-3, but on the left side, there are fewer walls.

Wait, the walls are mostly on the right, so moving left might be easier. Let me see if there are any walls blocking my path to the key. The key is at (-2,-2). Are there walls at (-2,-2)? No, the walls are mostly on the right. So, I can move left and down to reach the key.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move freely. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move normally unless there are other rules affecting me. Let me check if there are any ""stop"" rules applied to me. The ""rule `stop`"" is at (-2,1). So, if I move there, I might get stopped, but I don't need to go there. I need to go to (-2,-2).

So, my plan is to move left twice and down twice to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door at (3,1) and open it. Then, I can proceed to the win condition, which is at (7,3).

But wait, how do I know where the win condition is? The ""rule `win`"" is at (7,3). So, I need to get to that position. To get there, I might need to go through the door, which is at (3,1). So, the path would be: get the key, open the door, then move right to (7,3).

But before I can do that, I need to make sure I can move freely. Are there any other rules that might affect me? Let me check the other rule blocks:

- ""rule `wall`"" is at (-3,2). If I can move this, I might change what counts as a wall.
- ""rule `is`"" is at (-2,2). Maybe I can use this to create a new rule.
- ""rule `door`"" is at (3,1). That's the door I need to open with the key.
- ""rule `key`"" is at (5,1). That's the key's rule, which defines it as a key.

I think the key is at (-2,-2), so I need to move there. Let me outline the steps:

1. Move left twice: from (0,0) to (-2,0).
2. Then move down twice: from (-2,0) to (-2,-2) to pick up the key.

Once I have the key, I can move up to (-2,-1), then right to (3,-1), up to (3,1) to open the door. Then, move right to (7,1), up to (7,3) to reach the win condition.

But wait, are there any walls blocking my path after getting the key? Let me check:

- From (-2,-2), moving up to (-2,-1): is there a wall? The walls are at (2,y), so no walls at (-2,y). So, I can move up.
- Then right to (3,-1): no walls mentioned at (3,-1), so that's fine.
- Up to (3,1): that's the door. With the key, I can open it.
- Then right to (7,1): no walls, so I can move.
- Up to (7,3): that's the win condition.

So, the main steps are: get the key, open the door, reach the win.

But wait, do I need to change any rules? The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which is fine. I don't see any other rules affecting me, so I can proceed.

So, the first action is to move left to start heading towards the key.

Wait, but in the previous attempt, I didn't choose an action, so the system defaulted to idle. Now, I need to choose an action. Let me think: to get to the key, I need to move left twice and down twice. So, the first action should be left.

But let me double-check: is there any rule that would prevent me from moving left? The ""rule `stop`"" is at (-2,1), which is above the key. So, if I move to (-2,1), I would stop, but I don't need to go there. I'm going to (-2,-2), so I should be fine.

Therefore, the first action is to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, a door, and the ""WIN"" rule. The ""WIN"" rule is located 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That seems pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier.

I notice there's a ""key"" object two steps to the left and two steps down. There's also a ""door"" rule four steps to the right and one step up. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door, but I'm not sure yet. Let me see if I can move any rules to change the game mechanics.

There are several ""is"" rules scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 3 up, and another at 1 step left and 2 up. Maybe I can move these to create new rules. If I can make a rule like ""key is you,"" I could control the key and move it towards the door.

Wait, but I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" I need to check if any of these rules or objects are immovable. The ""stop"" rule is one step left and one step up, so I should avoid moving that. 

Let me think about the ball. It's two steps up. Maybe if I can make the ball into something else, like a ""WIN"" object, I could win without reaching the original ""WIN."" But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I go, I win. That would be the easiest way. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" and ""win"" closer.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""door is open"" by moving the ""is"" and ""open"" rules together, but I don't see an ""open"" rule here. Hmm.

Wait, there's a ""key"" and a ""door."" Maybe I need to get the key to open the door, which might lead me to the ""WIN."" But how do I get the key? I can't move the key directly unless I make it ""you."" So, perhaps I should move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is you.""

Let me plan the steps. I need to move the ""is"" rule that's one step left and two steps up to the key's position. The key is two steps left and two steps down. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule down by four steps and left by one step. That might take a few moves.

But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see where I can move. If I move right three times, I can get to the wall, but that's not helpful. Maybe I should move up first to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is eight steps right and three up. That's too far. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" and ""win"" together somewhere else.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" at seven steps right and three up. If I can move that to the ""win"" rule's position, I can make ""win is you,"" but that might not help. Or maybe ""win is win,"" which doesn't change anything.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is you."" That way, I can control the key and move it towards the door.

So, the ""is"" rule is at one step left and two up. The key is two left and two down. I need to move the ""is"" rule down by four steps and left by one step. But I can only move one step at a time. Let me see if I can move the ""is"" rule down.

Wait, can I move the ""is"" rule? Yes, unless it's a ""stop."" I don't think it is. So, I can move it down. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule down once. That would bring it to one left and one up. Then, move it down again to one left and at the same level. Then, move it left to two left and same level. Then, move it down to two left and one down. Then, move it down again to two left and two down, which is where the key is. So, after moving the ""is"" rule down four times and left once, it would be next to the key, making ""key is you.""

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a faster way. Alternatively, I could move the key up to the ""is"" rule. The key is two left and two down. If I can move it up four steps, it would reach the ""is"" rule at one left and two up. But I can't move the key unless it's ""you."" So, I need to make ""key is you"" first.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule at one left and two up down once to one left and one up. Then, move it down again to one left and same level. Then, move it left to two left and same level. Then, move it down to two left and one down. Then, move it down again to two left and two down, next to the key. That would take five moves. But I can only do one action at a time.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at seven right and three up to the key. But that's even farther. No, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But the ""win"" rule is too far. Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" but that might not help.

Another idea: if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's useful.

Wait, the ball is two steps up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball to make ""ball is you,"" then move the ball to the ""win"" rule. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is open"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""open,"" but I don't see an ""open"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""stop is not."" If I can negate the stop rule, I can move through walls. But I don't see a ""not"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop,"" which would make walls passable. That could help me move through them to reach the ""WIN.""

But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Wait, let me look again. The ""stop"" rule is one left and one up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can make ""stop is you,"" but that would make me stop, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is not,"" but again, no ""not"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key to open the door. So, I need to make ""key is you."" Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key.

The ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. The key is two left and two down. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule down four steps and left one step. Let me plan the moves:

1. Move the ""is"" rule down once: from one left, two up to one left, one up.
2. Move it down again: one left, same level.
3. Move it left once: two left, same level.
4. Move it down once: two left, one down.
5. Move it down again: two left, two down, next to the key.

After these five moves, the ""is"" rule would be next to the key, making ""key is you."" Then, I can control the key and move it towards the door.

But wait, each move is one step, so I need to do this step by step. But in the game, I can only perform one action at a time. So, I need to choose the first step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key up towards the ""is"" rule. But I can't move the key unless it's ""you."" So, I need to make ""key is you"" first.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer in one step. Let me see: the ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. If I move it down once, it becomes one left and one up. That's a start.

So, my first action should be to move the ""is"" rule down. But how do I represent that? I think I need to specify the direction to move the ""is"" rule. Wait, no, in the game, you move yourself, not the rules directly. So, I need to move Baba to pick up the ""is"" rule and move it.

Wait, no, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by moving into them. So, if I move into the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up and move it elsewhere.

So, to move the ""is"" rule at one left and two up, I need to move Baba to that position. Currently, Baba is at the starting point. Let me see the coordinates.

Wait, the observation says the ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. So, from Baba's position, I need to move left once and up twice. But I can only move one step at a time. So, first, I can move up once.

Wait, but the initial position is where Baba is. Let me assume Baba is at (0,0). Then, the ""is"" rule is at (-1, 2). So, to get there, I need to move left once and up twice.

But I can only move one step at a time. So, first, I can move up once to (0,1). Then, up again to (0,2). Then, left once to (-1,2), where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can pick it up and move it towards the key.

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I can take a different approach. Let me see if there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at seven right and three up. But that's too far. No, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. The ""win"" rule is eight right and three up. That's too far, but maybe I can create a new rule closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" The ball is two up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, making ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the ball.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think: if ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win the level. So, if I can make that rule, I can win by reaching the ball.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule next to the ball? The ball is two up. The ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. So, if I move the ""is"" rule right once, it would be at (0,2), next to the ball at (0,2). Wait, no, the ball is at (0,2), and the ""is"" rule is at (-1,2). So, moving the ""is"" rule right once would place it at (0,2), next to the ball. Then, the rule would be ""ball is is,"" which isn't helpful.

Wait, no, the rule would be ""ball is [whatever is next]."" Wait, no, the rule is formed by the subject and property. So, if I have ""ball"" next to ""is,"" it would be ""ball is [next word]."" But the next word would be whatever is to the right of ""is."" Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. But the ""win"" rule is too far.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But that's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is open."" But I don't see an ""open"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can make ""key is you"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the key. That way, I can control the key and move it to the door.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from one left and two up to two left and two down, where the key is. That's a distance of three left and four down. But I can only move one step at a time.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key up to the ""is"" rule. But I can't move the key unless it's ""you.""

Wait, maybe I can make ""key is you"" in one move. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key in one step, but that's not possible because they're too far apart.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for any other rules that could help.

I see a ""rule `baba`"" at two left and three down. Maybe I can make ""baba is something else."" But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I win wherever I am. So, how can I do that? I need to move the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But the ""win"" rule is eight right and three up. That's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule by moving ""is"" and ""win"" together somewhere else. But I don't see another ""win"" rule.

Wait, there's a ""rule `win`"" at seven right and three up. If I can move that next to Baba, I can make ""baba is win."" But that's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at seven right and three up next to the ""win"" rule to make ""win is win,"" which doesn't help.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is you,"" even if it takes multiple steps. So, my first step is to move the ""is"" rule down once.

Wait, but how do I represent moving the ""is"" rule? In the game, you move into the rule to pick it up, then move it elsewhere. So, I need to move Baba to the position of the ""is"" rule, pick it up, and then move it.

So, the ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. From Baba's starting position, I need to move left once and up twice. Let me plan the moves:

1. Move up once to (0,1).
2. Move up again to (0,2).
3. Move left once to (-1,2), where the ""is"" rule is.
4. Now, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it towards the key.

But each of these is a separate action. So, my first action should be to move up once.

Wait, but the user's previous action was ""left,"" and the observation shows that the ""is"" rule has moved. Maybe I need to adjust my plan.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at seven right and three up. But that's too far.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But that's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" The ball is two up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, making ""ball is win,"" then I just need to reach the ball.

So, the ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. The ball is at (0,2). So, if I move the ""is"" rule right once, it would be at (0,2), next to the ball. Then, the rule would be ""ball is [next word]."" But the next word would be whatever is to the right of ""is."" Wait, no, the rule is formed by the subject and property. So, if ""ball"" is next to ""is,"" it would be ""ball is [property]."" But the property would be whatever is next to ""is."" Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. But the ""win"" rule is too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is ball,"" then I can move as the ball. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and move it to the ""win"" rule. But that seems complicated.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to the key, even if it takes multiple steps. So, my first action is to move up once to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, but in the previous step, the user moved left, and the ""is"" rule moved. Maybe I need to adjust my plan based on that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at one left and two up down once to one left and one up. Then, move it down again to one left and same level. Then, move it left once to two left and same level. Then, move it down once to two left and one down. Then, move it down again to two left and two down, next to the key. That would take five moves, but I can only do one at a time.

So, my first action is to move the ""is"" rule down once. But how do I represent that? I think I need to move into the ""is"" rule, pick it up, and then move it down.

So, the ""is"" rule is at one left and two up. From Baba's position, I need to move left once and up twice to reach it. Then, I can pick it up and move it down.

But each move is one step. So, my first action is to move up once.

Wait, but the user's previous action was","

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""WIN"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a door, a key, and some other text blocks. The key is two steps to the left and two steps down. The door is four steps to the right and one step up. The win condition is eight steps to the right and three steps up. There's also a ball two steps up.

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can also manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The rules are formed by text blocks like ""IS,"" ""WIN,"" ""WALL,"" etc. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable or to redefine what ""WIN"" means.

First, I should probably move towards the key because it might be needed to open the door. The key is two steps to the left and two steps down from my current position. So, I need to move left twice and down twice. But I have to check if there are any walls blocking my path.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls around me. For example, there's a wall three steps to the right and three steps up. Another wall is three steps to the right and two steps up. There's also a wall three steps to the right and one step up, and another three steps to the right. So, moving right might be blocked, but moving left and down might be possible.

Wait, the key is two steps to the left and two steps down. So, I need to move left twice and down twice. Let me plan that: left, left, down, down. But I should check if there are any walls in that path. The walls are mostly to the right, so maybe the left and down paths are clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move towards the door first. The door is four steps to the right and one step up. But moving right might be blocked by walls. Let me see: the walls are three steps to the right in multiple positions, so moving right might not be feasible unless I can break through or change the rules.

Another idea: maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make some walls passable. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Wait, the ball is two steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with the rules.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The other rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" etc. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving text blocks. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I might create a new rule like ""win is something.""

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should first try to move towards the key to see if I can pick it up. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

So, my plan is to move left twice and down twice to reach the key. Let me try that. First, move left, then left again, then down, then down. I hope there are no walls blocking that path.

Wait, but in the previous observations, moving left and down might have walls. Let me check again. The walls are mostly to the right, so maybe the left and down paths are clear. I'll proceed with moving left twice and down twice to get the key.

Alternatively, if that path is blocked, I might need to find another way. Maybe I can move up first to avoid walls. But the ball is two steps up, so moving up might lead me to the ball. I'm not sure if that helps.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving left once to see if I can get closer to the key without hitting a wall. If that works, I'll continue moving left and down. If not, I'll have to think of another strategy, like changing the rules to make walls passable or redefine the win condition.

Wait, another idea: if I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make some walls stop me, but I'm not sure how that helps. Or maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" to create a new rule like ""wall is something,"" which might change the properties of walls.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first, as it seems necessary to progress. So, I'll try moving left twice and down twice to reach the key. Let's see if that works.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, a door, and some text blocks. The key is two steps down, and the door is five steps to the right and one step up. There's also a ""WIN"" rule nine steps to the right and three steps up. 

Hmm, the key is two steps down, which is directly below me. Maybe I can move down to pick it up. But wait, I need to check if there are any walls or other obstacles in the way. The wall is four steps to the right and one step down, so that's not blocking my path to the key. 

Once I have the key, I can probably open the door. The door is five steps to the right and one step up. So after getting the key, I should move right five steps and up one to reach the door. 

But before I can do that, I need to make sure I can move freely. The ""stop"" rule is one step up, which might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. If ""stop"" is applied to me, I can't move through those tiles. I should check if I can change the rules to remove the stop property from Baba.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""stop"" rule one step up. If I can move that rule away or change it, I might be able to remove the stop property. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""baba is not stop"" or something similar. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is two steps up, which is close to the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule to form a new rule like ""stop is something else,"" but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I could move the ""baba"" rule to combine with ""stop"" to make ""baba is stop,"" but that would be bad because it would prevent me from moving. 

Maybe a better approach is to move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and three steps down. If I can move it next to ""stop,"" I could create a rule like ""you is stop,"" but that would stop me as well. Hmm, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, I could try to break the existing ""baba is you"" rule by moving either ""baba"" or ""you"" away. But that would make me lose control of Baba, which isn't good. 

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another subject. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""key,"" I could create ""key is something,"" but I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe ""key is win"" or ""key is you."" If I make ""key is you,"" then the key would become controllable, but I already have the key in my inventory once I pick it up.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""door is win,"" so that when I reach the door, it counts as winning. That might be a quicker way to win without needing the key. But I need to see if that's possible.

Looking at the rules, the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps up. If I can move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and then next to ""win,"" I could create ""door is win."" That way, reaching the door would trigger the win condition.

But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" rule is five steps to the right and one step up. I can move it to the position of the ""is"" rule, which is two steps up. Wait, the ""is"" rule is two steps up, so if I move the ""door"" rule up two steps, it would be next to ""is,"" forming ""door is something."" Then, I can move the ""win"" rule next to that to make ""door is win.""

But moving the ""door"" rule might require breaking through walls or moving other rules out of the way. Let me check the layout again. The wall is four steps to the right and one step down, so it's not blocking the path to the door. The key is two steps down, so I can move down to pick it up.

Wait, maybe I should just pick up the key first. If I move down two steps, I can get the key. Then, I can move right five steps and up one to reach the door. But if the door is locked, I need the key to open it. So having the key would allow me to pass through the door.

Once I'm through the door, I can proceed towards the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles or stop rules in that path. The ""stop"" rule is one step up, so if I can avoid that area, I should be fine.

Alternatively, if I can't get through the door, maybe I can change the rules to make the door passable without the key. For example, if I make ""door is not stop,"" then I can walk through it without needing the key. But I'm not sure how to do that with the current rules.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am would be the win condition. But that might not be useful unless I can position myself correctly.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is one step to the right and three steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""win,"" I could create ""you is win,"" meaning that wherever I am would trigger the win condition. That could be a quick way to win without moving far.

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule to the position of the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and three steps up. That's quite far, so it might take a lot of moves, and I might run into walls or other obstacles along the way.

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to get the key, open the door, and proceed to the win condition. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move down two steps to pick up the key.
2. Move right five steps and up one step to reach the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Move towards the ""win"" rule, which is nine steps to the right and three steps up.

But I need to make sure that the path is clear. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0).
- Key is at (0, -2).
- Door is at (5,1).
- Win is at (9,3).

So, moving down to (0,-2) to get the key. Then right to (5,-2), but wait, the door is at (5,1). So I need to move up from (5,-2) to (5,1). But is there a wall blocking that path? The wall is at (4,1), so moving right to (5,-2), then up to (5,1) should be possible.

Once through the door, I need to move right four more steps and up two steps to reach the win condition at (9,3). I need to check if there are any walls or stop rules in that path. The walls are at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), (4,-3). So moving right from (5,1) to (9,1) is clear, then up to (9,3).

Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is at (0,1). If I'm moving up, I might hit that. But if I'm moving right first, I can avoid it. Alternatively, if I can change the rules to make ""stop"" not affect me, that would be better.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that allows me to pass through walls, but that might complicate things.

Another thought: if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me. But I need to see if I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and then next to ""not stop"" or something. But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at (0,1). If I can move it somewhere else, like next to a wall, then it won't affect me. But moving rules requires adjacent text blocks.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (0,1). The ""is"" rule is at (0,2). So if I move the ""stop"" rule up to (0,3), it would form ""is stop"" or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule down to (0,1) would make ""stop is something,"" but I'm not sure what that would do.

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should focus on getting the key and opening the door first, then deal with any obstacles on the way to the win condition.

So, the first step is to move down two steps to pick up the key. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to my advantage.

First, I should note the positions of the key and the door because they might be part of the solution. The key is one step down, and the door is five steps to the right and two steps up. There's also a ""stop"" rule two steps up, which might be blocking something or preventing me from moving through certain areas.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and four steps up. That seems pretty far, so maybe I need to create a new rule or modify an existing one to make reaching it easier.

The ball is one step to the right and three steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls, so that might be useful. I should consider if I can move the ball to help me reach the key or the door.

The ""stop"" rule is two steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can remove an obstacle or change the movement rules. For example, if I can make ""stop"" apply to something else, I might be able to move through walls or other blocked areas.

I also see a ""wall"" rule one step to the left and three steps up. If I can change this rule, I might be able to make walls passable or turn them into something else, which could open up new paths.

The ""is"" rule is three steps up, which is a bit abstract. Maybe I can use it to create a new rule by moving it next to another object. For example, if I can get ""is"" next to ""win,"" I might be able to redefine what ""win"" means.

The ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and two steps down, and the ""you"" rule is one step to the right and two steps down. If I can manipulate these, I might change who I am or what I can do. For instance, if I can make ""baba is key,"" I could pick up the key more easily.

The ""door"" rule is five steps to the right and two steps up. Doors usually require keys to open, so I need to get the key first. The key is one step down, which is relatively close, so maybe I can move towards it.

The ""key"" rule is seven steps to the right and two steps up. That's quite far, but if I can create a path or use the ball to help, I might be able to reach it.

I also see multiple walls in different positions. Walls are usually immovable unless I change their rules. If I can make walls into something else, like ""air"" or ""push,"" I might be able to move through them or use them to my advantage.

The ""stop"" rule is two steps up. If I can move this rule, I might be able to stop certain objects or change movement mechanics. For example, if I can make ""stop"" apply to the ball, I could prevent it from moving, or if I make ""stop"" apply to walls, I might be able to pass through them.

The ""is"" rule is two steps down. This is a crucial rule because it defines the relationships between objects. If I can manipulate this, I can create new rules that might help me win.

The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and two steps down. If I can change this, I might alter what ""you"" represents, which could change my abilities or the win condition.

Putting this all together, I think the key steps are:

1. Move towards the key to pick it up.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Manipulate the rules to create a path or change the win condition.

But I need to be careful about the walls and the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different object to prevent it from blocking me.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to another object. For example, if I can get ""is"" next to ""win,"" I might redefine the win condition to something easier to reach.

Another idea is to use the ball to push objects or break through walls. If I can move the ball into a position where it can push a wall or another rule, it might open up a new path.

I also need to consider the positions of all the rules and objects. The ""win"" rule is quite far, so maybe I need to create a shortcut by changing the rules of movement or the environment.

Perhaps I can make ""baba is key"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the key. That way, I can pick up the key as Baba and use it to open the door.

Alternatively, I could try to make ""wall is air"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""air"" if it's present, but I don't see an ""air"" rule here. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, I see a ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is you,"" I might be able to stop myself or others, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, making ""stop is wall"" could prevent movement through walls.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is one step down, so I can move down to pick it up. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is five steps to the right and two steps up. But I need to make sure the path is clear.

Looking at the walls, there are several walls in the way. I need to see if I can move any of them or change their properties. If I can make a wall into something else, like ""air,"" I can pass through it.

But without an ""air"" rule, I might need to use the ball to break through. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will break it, but I'm not sure if that's how it works in this game.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. If I can make ""stop is wall,"" then walls might become passable, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is two steps up. If I can move it next to a wall, I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" which might prevent movement through walls. But I want to pass through walls, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is something else,"" which might change the win condition to something easier to reach.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should first try to get the key and see what happens.

So, my plan is:

1. Move down to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed towards the win condition.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. Let me check the positions again.

The key is one step down, so I can move down to get it. Then, the door is five steps to the right and two steps up. I need to move right five times and up two times from my current position.

But there are walls in the way. Let me see:

- Wall is four steps to the right and four steps up.
- Another wall is four steps to the right and three steps up.
- And so on.

I think the walls are blocking the path, so I need to find a way to move through them or around them.

Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, it might break it, but I'm not sure if that's how it works.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. If I can make ""stop is wall,"" then maybe I can pass through walls.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule first.

The ""stop"" rule is two steps up. If I can move it next to a wall, I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop,"" which might prevent movement through walls. But I want to pass through walls, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is something else,"" which might change the win condition to something easier to reach.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should first try to get the key and see what happens.

So, I'll start by moving down to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, a door, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's mechanics in my favor.

First, I should note the positions of all the important objects. The ""WIN"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far, so I might need to create a path or change some rules to make it easier to reach. The ""key"" is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""door"" is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, the key is to the right of the door, which suggests that I might need to pick up the key to open the door, but I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

There's also a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls, so that might be useful. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, which probably means that any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved. I need to be careful about that.

The ""wall"" rules are positioned in various places, which might indicate that walls can be manipulated. If I can change a wall into something else, I could create a path. For example, if I can make a wall into a ""you"" or ""win,"" that could help me reach the win condition more easily.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. These are essential because they define the relationships between subjects and properties. If I can move these ""is"" rules around, I can create new rules or modify existing ones.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm trying to reach the win condition, I probably need to move towards it. But the path is blocked by walls, so I need to find a way to remove or bypass them.

One strategy could be to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall to change its property. For example, if I can make a wall into a ""you,"" then I can move through it. Alternatively, I could make a wall into a ""win"" to turn it into the goal.

Looking at the positions, the ""is"" rule is 4 steps up, which is near the top. The walls are spread out, but some are close to the ""is"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to a wall to redefine it.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 4 steps up, and the wall is 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. So, if I move right four times and up four times, I can get to the wall. But that seems too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule or the ""you"" rule to change my properties. If I can make myself into a ""win,"" then wherever I am becomes the win condition, which would be an instant win.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" or ""you"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""baba"" or ""you"" rule is, I can create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is, I can create ""you is win"" or something similar. That would make me the win condition.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it by moving myself next to it and then moving in a direction to push it. Since I'm Baba, I can push objects if they are movable. I need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, it's probably movable unless it's defined as ""stop.""

Looking at the rules, I see a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. So, any object with ""stop"" can't be moved. I need to make sure that the ""is"" rule isn't a ""stop."" From the active rules, only ""baba is you"" is active, so the ""is"" rule itself doesn't have a property unless defined by another rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is just a rule; it doesn't have a subject or property unless combined. So, I can move it as long as it's not defined as ""stop."" Since the ""stop"" rule is separate, I think the ""is"" rule is movable.

So, my plan is to move towards the ""is"" rule, pick it up, and then move it next to the ""you"" rule to create a new rule like ""you is win."" That would make me the win condition, and I would win immediately.

But how do I get to the ""is"" rule? It's 4 steps up. I need to move up four times. Let me check the path. Are there any walls blocking me? The walls are positioned at various points, but I think I can move up without being blocked because the walls are to the right and left.

Wait, the walls are 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is above me. So, moving up four steps should be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get closer to the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is far. So, moving up four steps is better.

Let me try to move up four times. Each ""up"" action moves me one step up. So, I'll need to output ""up"" four times. But the system only allows one action at a time, so I need to choose the next step.

Wait, in the previous interactions, the user was trying to move left and down, but the system didn't accept those actions. So, maybe the correct path is to move up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move right to get closer to the key and door, but that might not be necessary if I can redefine the win condition.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the map. The ""WIN"" rule is far to the right and up, so maybe I need to create a path by redefining walls. Alternatively, I can redefine myself as the win condition.

I think the quickest way is to redefine myself as win. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down from my current position. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is, I can create ""you is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move next to it and then push it. The ""is"" rule is 4 steps up. So, I need to move up four times to reach it.

Wait, but moving up four times would take me to the ""is"" rule at 4 steps up. Then, I can pick it up and move it down to where the ""you"" rule is.

So, the first step is to move up. Let me choose ""up"" as the action.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step down, which might be useful if there's a door blocking my path. Doors are typically opened with keys, so I should look for a door nearby.

I notice a ""door"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win. But first, I need to get the key. The key is 1 step down from my current position, so I should move down to pick it up.

Wait, but before I move, I should check if there are any obstacles or rules that might prevent me from moving. There's a ""stop"" rule 2 steps up, which might block movement in that direction, but since I'm moving down, that shouldn't be an issue. Also, there are walls around, so I need to make sure I don't hit any.

So, my plan is to move down to get the key. Once I have the key, I can move right towards the door, open it, and continue moving right towards the win. But first, I need to get the key.

Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and the key is directly below me. So, moving down should get me the key. After that, I can move right, but I need to make sure the path is clear. There are walls on the right, but the door is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up, so I might need to adjust my path accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the key or door behave differently, but since I'm just starting, it's probably simpler to just move down to get the key. Once I have the key, I can proceed to the door and then to the win.

So, the immediate action is to move down to pick up the key. That should be the first step towards solving the puzzle.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, a door, and some other text blocks. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's behavior.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, it's 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. To get there, I might need to break through walls or change some rules to make movement easier.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls passable. Also, there's a ""door"" and a ""key"" nearby. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door, but I'm not sure how that ties into the rules.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the ""WIN"" rule.

I also see a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to change what Baba is, which could give me new abilities. For example, if I make Baba into a ""WIN"" object, I could win immediately, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Another thing is the ""is"" rule 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to create new rules or modify existing ones. For instance, if I place ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make winning easier.

I should also consider the walls. There are walls all around, but some might be movable if I change their properties. If I can make a wall into something else, like a ""stop,"" it might block certain paths or allow me to pass through.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. First, I should probably move towards the ""WIN"" rule, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can find a way to break through. Alternatively, I could try to change the rules to make the walls passable or to create a new win condition.

I also notice that the ""key"" is 1 step down. If I can get the key, maybe I can open the door, which could lead to a path towards the ""WIN"" rule. But I'm not sure how the door and key interact with the rules.

Another approach is to look for any rules that can be manipulated to change the game's mechanics. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then reaching the ""WIN"" rule would be unnecessary because I would already be the win condition.

Wait, that's a good point. If I can create a rule where ""baba is win,"" then I would win as soon as I make that rule. So, how can I do that? I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba."" But the ""win"" rule is far away, so I might need to move other rules to create that combination.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, but that might not be straightforward. I need to figure out how to move the rules around without getting stuck.

I also see that there's a ""stop"" rule. If I can move that, I might be able to prevent certain objects from moving or interacting. But I'm not sure how that would help me reach the ""WIN"" rule.

Another idea is to use the ball to push objects. If I can get the ball to push a wall or a rule into a position that helps me, that could be useful. For example, pushing a wall to create a path or pushing a rule to create a new combination.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to create a new win condition or to make the path to the existing ""WIN"" rule easier. Since the ""WIN"" rule is far away, I might need to create a shortcut or change the rules to make the win condition something I can achieve without moving so much.

Let me try to outline a possible plan:

1. Move towards the ""is"" rule that's 1 step down. If I can move that, I can create new rules.
2. Use the ""is"" rule to combine with other rules or objects to create a new win condition.
3. Alternatively, move the ""baba"" rule to create a new identity for Baba that makes winning easier.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule closer to the ""win"" rule to create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition.

Wait, if I can make ""win is you,"" then I would win as soon as I make that rule. So, how can I move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you""? The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is quite far. I might need to move other rules to create a path or to bring the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""you"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. But the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to create a new rule.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""baba"" rule to create a new identity. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. So, how can I move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win""?

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that to where the ""win"" rule is, I could create ""baba is win."" But that's a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer to the ""is"" rule. But that might require breaking through walls or using the ball to push it.

I think the best approach is to try to create a new rule that makes me the win condition. So, I'll try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule and myself. But since the ""win"" rule is far away, I might need to find a way to bring it closer or find another way to create the rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball to push the ""win"" rule. If I can get the ball to push the ""win"" rule into a position where I can create the new rule, that would work. But I'm not sure how to control the ball's movement.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to where the ""baba"" rule is, creating ""baba is win."" That would make me the win condition. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step down to where the ""baba"" rule is.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that are not ""stop."" I need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. If it's not, I might need to change its properties first.

I think I need to move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step down. If I can move that, I can place it next to the ""baba"" rule to create ""baba is win."" So, I'll try to move the ""is"" rule up by one step to where the ""baba"" rule is.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step down. If I move up, it would go to the same level as the ""baba"" rule. Then, I can move it left to be next to ""baba.""

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule up by one step.
2. Move the ""is"" rule left by one step to be next to the ""baba"" rule.
3. This would create the rule ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" rule. I need to check if it's movable. Since it's a rule, it might be movable unless it's defined as ""stop.""

Looking back, I don't see a ""stop"" rule applied to ""is,"" so I think it's movable. So, I'll proceed.

First, I need to move the ""is"" rule up. But how do I do that? I control Baba, so I need to move Baba to where the ""is"" rule is and push it.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step down. So, I need to move down to reach it. But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the layout again.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step down from my current position. So, I can move down to pick it up and then move it up.

But I'm not sure if I can carry rules. In Baba Is You, you can pick up and move text blocks if they're not stopped. So, I think I can move the ""is"" rule.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move down to the ""is"" rule.
2. Pick it up and move it up to where the ""baba"" rule is.
3. Place it next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can do that in one move. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule step by step.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""is"" rule is. But the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move it up and right, I can place it next to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, if I move the ""baba"" rule up by one step, it would be next to the ""is"" rule. Then, the rule would be ""baba is [something]."" But I need to make it ""baba is win.""

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule up first.

So, I'll move down to the ""is"" rule and then move it up. Let's see.

But I'm not sure if moving the ""is"" rule will have the desired effect. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Another idea: If I can make ""win is you,"" then I would win as soon as I make that rule. So, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you.""

The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's too far. Maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule closer to me.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""you is win,"" which would also make me the win condition. So, I need to move the ""you"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move it next to the ""is"" rule, I can create ""you is win.""

Wait, if I move the ""you"" rule up by one step, it would be next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can place the ""win"" rule next to them, but that's still far.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win."" But again, the distance is an issue.

Maybe I should focus on creating a new win condition by making ""baba is win."" That seems more straightforward.

So, I'll try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule. Let's see.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step down. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So, if I move the ""is"" rule left by one step, it would be next to the ""baba"" rule, creating ""baba is [something].""

But I need to make it ""baba is win."" So, I need to have ""win"" next to ""is"" and ""baba."" Since ""win"" is far away, maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule closer to me.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. But that might require breaking through walls or using the ball.

Wait, the ball is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to push the ""win"" rule. But I'm not sure how to control the ball's movement.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that makes the ball into a ""win"" object. Then, I can just reach the ball to win.

So, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would make me win. That could be a quicker way.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and ""win"" rules. But the ""ball"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, and ""win"" is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a long distance.

Maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule closer to me by moving the ""win"" rule or creating a new one.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" as I thought before.

I think the best approach is to try to create ""baba is win."" So, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step down. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So, if I move the ""is"" rule left by one step, it would be next to the ""baba"" rule, creating ""baba is [something].""

But I need to make it ""baba is win."" So, I need to have ""win"" next to ""is"" and ""baba."" Since ""win"" is far away, maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule closer to me.

Maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule closer to me by moving the ""win"" rule or creating a new one.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" as I thought before.

I think I've circled back to the same idea. Let me try to proceed with moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule.

So, I'll move down to the ""is"" rule and then move it left to be next to ""baba."" That should create ""baba is [something]."" But I need it to be ""baba is win.""

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to them. But that's too far. Alternatively, I can create a new ""win"" rule by moving the ""win"" text block next to ""is"" and ""baba.""

But I don't see a separate ""win"" text block; it's part of the rule. So, I might need to break the existing rule.

Alternatively, I can try to make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule into position. But that's complicated.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's look for any other rules that can help me.

I see a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to block certain paths or make walls passable. But I'm not sure how that helps me reach the ""WIN"" rule.

There's also a ""door"" and a ""key."" Maybe I need to get the key to open the door, which could lead to the ""WIN"" rule. But I'm not sure how that ties into the rules.

The key is 1 step down. If I can get the key, maybe I can open the door, but I need to figure out how that affects the rules.

Alternatively, I can try to make","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball, a key, a door, and various walls. The walls are placed in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible. The key is near the bottom, and the door is a bit to the right. The ""win"" rule is way to the right, so I need to get there somehow.

I notice that there are several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you."" Maybe I can manipulate these to change the rules and make the level easier. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" I could control the key and maybe unlock the door.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is two steps down and one step to the left from my current position. So, I should move down twice and left once. Let me check if there are any walls blocking that path. It looks like there's a wall two steps to the right and one step down, but I'm moving left, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule one step up and one step to the left. If I move left, I might hit that. But since I'm moving down first, maybe I can avoid it. Let me plan my moves carefully.

First, move down to get closer to the key. Then, move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it, which should lead me closer to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange some rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. But for now, getting the key seems like the straightforward approach.

So, the immediate action should be to move down to reach the key. Let me choose the ""down"" action to start.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a door, a key, and some other elements. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's behavior.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. It's at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. To get there, I might need to break through walls or change some rules to make movement easier.

The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Balls can be pushed, so maybe I can use it to break through walls or reach higher places.

I also see a ""baba"" rule at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, I might be able to change what Baba is, which could give me new abilities.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the key to open the door. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. To get there, I might need to go around or through some walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I can move that rule, I can make the walls passable. Maybe I can push the ball to knock down the walls or move the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by moving text blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key more easily.

But first, I need to get closer to the key. Let me plan my movements. I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move right to reach the key's area.

I'll start by moving right a few times to get closer to the key. Then, I can assess if I need to break any walls or change rules to proceed further.

So, my first action should be to move right to get closer to the key and the door. That way, I can see if I can open the door and reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The ""WIN"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice a ""key"" object 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to open a door or something.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Doors usually require keys to open. So maybe I need to get the key first. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left to pick it up.

But before I do that, I should check if there are any other important rules. There's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I step on that, I might get stuck. I need to avoid that.

Also, there's a ""ball"" 4 steps up. Balls can sometimes be used to push things or change the environment. Maybe I can use it later, but right now, getting the key seems more urgent.

So, my plan is to move left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go towards the door. After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

But wait, I should also consider the other rules. There's a ""wall"" rule 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up. If I move left, I might encounter walls that block my path. I need to make sure I can navigate around them.

Hmm, maybe I should first move up to avoid any walls. Let me see: moving up 4 steps would take me near the ""ball."" Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or change some rules.

Alternatively, moving right might help me get closer to the door and win. But the key is to the left, so I need to prioritize that.

I think the best first step is to move left to get the key. That way, I can open the door and proceed towards the win condition without being blocked by walls or other obstacles.

Wait, but if I move left, I might step on the ""stop"" rule. I need to be careful. Maybe I should move up first to avoid that.

Let me visualize the map. Starting from my current position, moving left would take me towards the key but also towards the ""stop"" rule. Maybe I should move up first to get a better position.

If I move up, I can avoid the ""stop"" and get closer to the ball. Once I'm near the ball, I can decide whether to use it or continue towards the key.

Alternatively, moving right could help me get closer to the door and win, but without the key, I might be stuck.

I think the key is essential, so I should try to get it first. To do that safely, I'll move up first to avoid the ""stop"" rule, then move left to pick up the key.

Wait, but moving up might take me into walls. I need to check the exact positions. The walls are 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, so moving up from my current position might not hit a wall immediately.

I think moving up is the safest first step to avoid the ""stop"" rule and position myself better to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""win"" rule 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe I need the key to open a door? Let me check if there's a door. Yes, there's a ""door"" rule 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, I probably need the key to get through the door to reach the win.

But wait, how do I get the key? The key is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. Let me see if I can move there. I need to make sure there are no walls blocking me. The map shows walls in several places, but I think I can navigate around them.

First, I should move towards the key. Since the key is to the left and down, I'll start by moving left. But I need to check if moving left is possible without hitting a wall. The objects on the map show walls 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up, but I'm not sure if that's in my way. Maybe I can move left safely.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. That might mean that moving left from there is blocked. But I'm not near that area yet. Let me focus on getting to the key first.

So, I'll move left once. That should bring me closer to the key. After moving left, I'll be 1 step to the left. Then, I can move down to reach the key. Once I have the key, I can use it to open the door.

After getting the key, I need to go towards the door. The door is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, from my current position, I'll need to move right several times and up a couple of times. I have to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The map shows walls in various places, but I think I can navigate around them.

Once I open the door, I can proceed towards the win object. The win is 8 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is quite a distance. I'll need to move right and up carefully, avoiding any walls or obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. Let me think about the rules. If I can manipulate the rules, I might be able to change my properties or the environment. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But I don't see any rules that allow me to do that right now.

Another idea: if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that might help. But I don't see any movable text blocks near me. The closest movable object is the key. So, I think the best approach is to get the key, open the door, and then proceed to the win.

So, my first step is to move left to reach the key. Let's do that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other elements. The rules are spread out, and I need to figure out how to manipulate them to change the game's behavior.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" rule is. From the observation, it's 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. To get there, I might need to break some walls or change the rules to make movement easier.

I notice there's a ""key"" object 1 step down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock a door. There's also a ""door"" rule 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, perhaps the key is needed to open the door, which would allow me to proceed further.

But before I can get to the key, I have to navigate through the walls. The walls are placed in a way that might block my path. I see a ""stop"" rule 2 steps up, which probably means that the wall there can't be moved. So, I need to find a way around or through these walls.

I also see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break through walls. Maybe I can use the ball to break a wall or create a new path.

Another thing I notice is the ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move this rule, I might be able to change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would become the win condition, which could end the level immediately. But I need to see if that's possible.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule, I might change who is controlling what. But since ""baba is you,"" I'm already controlling Baba, so maybe that's not necessary right now.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. I should probably move towards the key first since it's closer. To get to the key, I need to go down 1 step. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking me. From my current position, moving down might be possible.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door. The door is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So, after getting the key, I should move right and up to reach the door. Using the key on the door should open it, allowing me to proceed further.

After opening the door, my next target is the ""WIN"" rule. It's 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is quite a distance. I might need to break some walls or use the ball to create a path. Alternatively, I could try to change the rules to make movement easier, like making Baba able to jump or pass through walls.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. These could be used to create new rules. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I might be able to set a new win condition. But I need to be careful because changing rules can have unexpected effects.

Another strategy could be to make Baba into a different object, like a ""stop"" or ""door,"" but that might not be helpful. Instead, I should focus on using the key and door to progress towards the win condition.

So, to summarize, my plan is:
1. Move down to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed towards the ""WIN"" rule, possibly using the ball to break walls or change the environment.
4. If needed, manipulate other rules to create a path or change the win condition.

I need to make sure each move is valid and doesn't get me stuck. Let me start by moving down to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""door"" 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. That might block my path. I also see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to break something or change a rule.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to change the properties of objects. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

I'm at the starting position, and I need to figure out how to move towards the win. The ""win"" is way to the right and up, so I probably need to move right and up. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the layout:

- Walls are at various positions, some to the right and up, others down. I need to navigate around them or change their properties.

- The ""key"" is to the right and up, so I might need to collect it first. But to get to the key, I have to pass through walls or find a way around.

- The ""door"" is also to the right and up, so maybe the key is needed to open it. If I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed to the win.

But how do I get past the walls? Maybe I can change the rules to make walls passable or turn them into something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can move through them, but that might not be the best idea.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" to change its property. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I need to make ""stop is nothing"" or something like that to remove the stop effect.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away or change it, that might help. For example, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then I can control the stop, but I'm not sure.

I also see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule when it's moved. If I can move the ball to a position where it affects a rule, that might help.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. I need to choose the best direction to move towards the win while considering the obstacles.

If I move right, I might get closer to the key and door. If I move up, I might hit the stop rule. Maybe I should move right first to get closer to the key and door.

But I need to check if moving right is possible without hitting a wall. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various up positions. So, moving right might be blocked by walls. Maybe I need to change the rules to make walls passable or remove them.

Alternatively, I can try to move up to see if I can bypass the walls. But the stop rule is 3 steps up, which might block me.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving right first and see if I can get past the walls or find a way to change the rules to make progress.

Wait, I also see that the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe I can move there to change the rules related to Baba. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by being Baba. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get closer to the key and door, as that seems like a necessary step to reach the win. So, I'll choose to move right.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The ""WIN"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also see a ""key"" which is 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to open a door or something.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Doors usually require keys to open. So maybe I need to get the key first. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left to pick it up.

But before I do that, I should check if there are any other important rules. There's a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I step on that, I might get stuck. I need to avoid that.

Also, there's a ""ball"" 4 steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does. Maybe it's just an obstacle or maybe it can be used somehow. I'll keep that in mind.

So, my plan is to move left to get the key, then figure out how to use it to open the door and reach the win condition. But I need to make sure I don't step on the ""stop"" rule. Let me see the path.

If I move left once, I'll get the key. Then, I can move right towards the door. But the door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I need to navigate around any walls. There are walls in various places, so I have to be careful not to hit them.

Wait, there's a ""baba"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I change that, maybe I can alter my properties. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. I think getting the key is more urgent.

So, first action: move left to pick up the key. That should help me progress towards the door and eventually the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball, walls, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""key."" The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. The ""win"" rule is way to the right, 9 steps up. There are also doors and keys, which might mean I need to unlock something.

I notice that the ball is near some walls. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But wait, the ball is just an object; unless there's a rule that makes it do something, it's just there. Hmm.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I can make that apply to something, maybe I can stop a wall or another object. But I'm not sure how yet.

The door is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door. But how do I get to the key? There are walls in the way.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I move that, maybe I can change who is ""you."" But I'm not sure if that helps.

I think the key is to get to the key, then use it to open the door, and then proceed to the win. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move some walls or use the ball to break through.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules together. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can just reach the win by being Baba. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. But how? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop.""

Looking at the map, the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it immovable, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I can make the ball push a wall, maybe I can create a path. But I don't see a rule that makes the ball push.

Wait, the ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I move Baba next to the ball, maybe I can push it. But I don't know if that's allowed unless there's a rule for it.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. Let's see, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So I need to move right and up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps to the right and various up positions. So maybe I can go up first, then right. Let me try moving up a few steps to avoid the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to block something or create a new rule. But I'm not sure.

I think the best course of action is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key. That way, I can pick it up and then open the door to reach the win.

I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is where Baba is. The walls are positioned in a way that might create a path or block me. I need to figure out how to move through the map without getting stuck.

Since the ""win"" is so far to the right and up, I might need to move right several times. But I have to be careful about the walls. Let me plan my steps:

1. Move right to get closer to the key and door.
2. Check if there are any walls blocking my path.
3. If I can't go straight, maybe I need to go up or down to bypass walls.
4. Once I get the key, I can open the door to proceed further.

Wait, but I don't have the key yet. So I need to move towards the key first. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So I should move right 7 times and up 3 times, but I have to make sure there are no walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules closer. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location, I might not have to go all the way to the right.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. Let me try moving right a few steps to see if I can reach the key.

I think the best first move is to go right to start moving towards the key and the door. That way, I can progress towards the win condition step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and some other stuff. The ""WIN"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. To get there, I probably need to move right several times.

But wait, there are walls in the way. Walls are usually immovable unless I change the rules. Let me check the rules. There's a ""wall is stop"" rule, which means walls stop movement. So I can't just walk through them. I need to find a way to either move the walls or change the rules so that I can pass through them.

I also see a ""key"" object. It's at 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to open a door. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So if I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed further.

But how do I get the key? It's only 1 step to the left, so maybe I can move left once to pick it up. But I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably near the bottom. Let me visualize the map.

Starting from my position, moving left once would take me to the key. Then, with the key, I can go to the door. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 up. So after getting the key, I need to move right 5 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls in the way, so I might need to break through them or find another path.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make walls passable. There's a ""wall is stop"" rule, but if I can change that, maybe I can make walls not stop me. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, or replace it with something else.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 7 steps right and 5 up, and another at 1 step left and 4 up. Maybe I can move these to create new rules. For instance, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would become controllable, but that might not help. Or ""wall is push"" could allow me to push them.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push walls. If I can make the ball push walls, then I can move the walls out of the way. To do that, I'd need a rule like ""ball is push."" But I don't see that rule currently. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" and ""push"" rules together.

But first, I need to get to the ball. The ball is at 4 steps up, which is above me. So I need to move up 4 steps. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move around them or find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself into a ball. If I can change the rule to ""baba is ball,"" then I can become a ball and possibly push walls. But I don't see a ""ball"" rule near me. Let me check the objects again.

There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 2 steps left and 1 step down. Maybe I can move that to change my properties. If I can move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""ball,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is ball.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule. Since I'm Baba, I can pick up and move rules. So I can move left twice and down once to get the ""baba"" rule. Then, I can move it next to ""is"" and ""ball"" to create the new rule.

Once I'm a ball, I can push walls. Then, I can move right and up to reach the key and the door. After opening the door, I can proceed to the ""WIN"" object.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left twice and down once to pick up the ""baba"" rule.
2. Move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""ball"" to create ""baba is ball.""
3. Now, I'm a ball and can push walls.
4. Move up 4 steps to reach the ball's original position, but since I'm a ball, I can push walls out of the way.
5. Move right to get the key.
6. Use the key to open the door.
7. Proceed to the ""WIN"" object.

But wait, I need to make sure I can actually move the rules. Since I'm Baba, I can pick up and move rules as long as they're not stopped by walls. So I need to plan the path to move the ""baba"" rule without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, then walls won't stop me. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, the walls will no longer stop movement.

So another approach:

1. Move left once and up three steps to pick up the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move it somewhere else, like down or right, so that walls are no longer stopped.
3. Then, I can move through walls freely.
4. Proceed to the key, door, and win.

But I'm not sure if that's possible because moving the ""stop"" rule might require breaking the current rule. Let me think.

If I move the ""stop"" rule away, then walls will no longer have the ""stop"" property. So I can walk through them. That could be a quicker solution.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left once and up three steps to get the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move it down or right to a safe place.
3. Now, walls don't stop me, so I can move through them.
4. Move right and up to reach the key, then the door, then the win.

This seems more straightforward. I don't need to change myself into a ball. Just manipulate the ""stop"" rule.

But I need to make sure I can reach the ""stop"" rule without being blocked. Let me check the path. From my starting position, moving left once and up three steps. Are there walls in the way?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 up, but I'm moving left, so I should be clear. Wait, no, the walls are at 3 steps right, so moving left from the starting position, I should be able to reach the ""stop"" rule without hitting walls.

So I'll proceed with this plan.

First, move left once to get to the position where the ""stop"" rule is. Then, move up three steps to pick it up. Once I have it, I can move it somewhere else, like down or right, to deactivate the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once the walls are passable, I can move freely to the key, door, and win.

So the immediate action is to move left once to start getting the ""stop"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that the rule ""wall"" is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that rule to change what counts as a wall. If I can make something else a wall, I might be able to clear a path.

I also see a ball at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up, which might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. If I can change that rule, I might be able to move more freely.

Let me think about the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. I need to see if I can move any rule blocks to create new rules or change existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to something else, I can create a new rule like ""ball is you"" or ""key is win.""

I should also consider the positions of the rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to something else, I can change what counts as the win condition.

Wait, there's a ""you"" rule at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can make ""you"" something else, like ""you is win,"" then reaching the ""you"" object would make me win. That might be a shortcut.

Alternatively, I could try to make the ball into a key or something else to bypass the door. Or maybe make the door into a passable object by changing its rule.

I need to figure out which rule blocks I can move. The ""is"" rule is movable since it's not a wall or stop. So, I can move the ""is"" rule to create new combinations.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key to open the door, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different object, making that object a wall instead, which could clear the path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, allowing me to pass through areas that were previously blocked.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to the door, then the door would stop me, but if I have the key, maybe I can bypass it. Or perhaps I can make the door into a passable object by changing its rule.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either change the win condition or clear the path to the win. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make the win object into me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule to make ""key is win,"" so that picking up the key would make me win. That could be a way to bypass the door.

But I need to get to the key first. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There are walls in the way, so I might need to move some walls or change their rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule to a different object, I can change what counts as a wall. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to the ball, then the ball becomes a wall, and the actual walls become passable.

That could clear the path. So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule to the ball. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule block next to the ball.

The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So, they are adjacent horizontally. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right, it would be next to the ball, creating the rule ""ball is wall.""

But wait, moving the ""wall"" rule would require me to be next to it. I'm currently at the starting position, which is where Baba is. Let me check where Baba is.

Looking at the objects, Baba is at the starting point, and the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So, I can move Baba around.

I think the plan is:

1. Move Baba to the left to reach the ""wall"" rule.
2. Move the ""wall"" rule to the right, next to the ball, making ""ball is wall.""
3. Now, the ball becomes a wall, and the actual walls might become passable.
4. Then, I can move through the area where the walls were, as they are no longer walls.
5. Proceed to the key, then to the door, and then to the win.

Alternatively, if making the ball a wall doesn't help, I might need a different approach. Maybe moving the ""stop"" rule to a different position to allow movement.

Another idea: If I can make the door into a passable object, like ""door is you,"" then I can walk through it without needing the key. But I need to see if that's possible.

The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create a new rule. But I need to get there first.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to focus on changing the win condition. If I can make something else the win, like the key, then reaching the key would make me win.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create ""win is you,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, moving the ""win"" rule next to the key to make ""key is win.""

But I need to get to the key first. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to be next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is key,"" but that might not change the win condition.

Wait, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. So, I just need to reach the key.

But the path to the key is blocked by walls. So, I need to clear the path by changing the rules.

Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule to the ball, making the ball a wall. Then, the actual walls might become passable.

So, steps:

1. Move left to reach the ""wall"" rule.
2. Move the ""wall"" rule to the right, next to the ball, creating ""ball is wall.""
3. Now, the ball is a wall, and the other walls might be passable.
4. Move up to go through where the walls were.
5. Proceed to the key, then to the door, and then to the win.

Alternatively, if the walls are still blocking, I might need to move more rules.

Another approach: Use the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to the door, then the door would stop me, but if I have the key, maybe I can bypass it.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on making the ball a wall to clear the path.

I think I'll try moving the ""wall"" rule to the ball. So, I need to move left to get to the ""wall"" rule, then move it right to be next to the ball.

Once that's done, the ball becomes a wall, and the other walls might be passable. Then I can move up and right to reach the key.

After getting the key, I can go to the door, which might now be passable if I changed the rules correctly, and then reach the win.

So, the first action is to move left to reach the ""wall"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The key is 1 step to the right, which might be important. There's also a door 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a key 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Hmm, maybe I need the key to open the door.

The rules are a bit scattered. There's a ""wall"" rule 4 steps up, which probably means that wall is defined as something. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, and another ""is"" rule is 1 step down. I'm not sure how that affects things yet.

I also see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe that's preventing me from moving somewhere. The ""door"" rule is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to change rules or move something else.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should try moving towards the key first. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and reach the win condition. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key.

Wait, but there are walls in the way. The walls are at 5 steps to the right and various steps up. I need to see if I can move around them or break them. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, so maybe that's blocking me.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I might be able to go through the walls. Let me see if I can move any rules.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. If I move that, maybe I can change how something is defined. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get closer to the key. Let me try that.

There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out if I can move through them or if I can change the rules to make them passable.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move normally unless walls are defined as stop.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can combine that with the wall rule, maybe I can make walls stop movement. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure how.

I think the key is to get the key, then go through the door to reach the win. But to get to the key, I need to move right. Let me see the path. From my starting position, I need to move right several times, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the wall rules to change their properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would be the win condition, but that might not help directly.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""you is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting position, and I need to move right and up to reach the key and door. But walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move the wall rule to change their behavior. If I can make walls passable, that would help.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 4 up. If I move that to combine with ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls block movement. But that's the opposite of what I want. Maybe I can make ""wall is nothing"" or something else.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 up. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can create ""wall is stop."" But that would make walls stop me, which is not helpful. Maybe I need to avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, ""wall is you"" would make walls be me, but that doesn't make sense. Or ""wall is move,"" but I don't see a ""move"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is at 7 right and 3 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the wall rule to change their properties.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule at 5 right and 3 up. If I can get the key, I can open the door. So, I need to get to the key, which is at 7 right and 3 up. But to get there, I have to pass through walls. Maybe I can make walls passable by changing the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The win is at 9 right and 5 up. That's too far. Maybe I can bring it closer by moving the rule blocks.

Wait, I see a ""baba"" rule at 1 left and 2 down. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is key,"" which would let me pick up the key. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: if I can make ""you is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule next to ""is"" and ""key."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""key is you,"" which would let me pick up the key. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule at 4 up next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop."" But that would make walls block me, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""key."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a long way, but maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule closer.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create ""you is key."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""key,"" I can make ""you is key."" But the ""key"" rule is far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. If I can move it to be next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can create ""key is you."" But that might not help directly.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I can move it to be next to me, I can win without moving far. But that requires moving the ""win"" rule, which might be tricky.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. But I'm not sure what. Maybe I can push a rule block to create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to change the behavior of something. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can combine it with another rule, I can make something stop.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through without needing the key. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""open."" But I don't see an ""open"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is door,"" which would let me open the door by moving onto it. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit overwhelming. Maybe I should try moving in a direction and see what happens. Let me try moving right. If I move right, I might hit a wall. But if I can change the wall rules, maybe I can pass through.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that to be next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls block me. But I don't want that. Maybe I can move it elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, ""wall is move."" But I don't see a ""move"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving other rules.

Wait, there's a ""baba"" rule at 1 left and 2 down. If I can move that next to ""is"" and ""move,"" I can make ""baba is move,"" which would let me move through walls. But I don't see a ""move"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to move up first. If I move up, I might get closer to the ""is"" rule at 4 up. Then I can try to create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 4 up is alone. If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to it, I can make ""wall is something."" But I'm not sure what.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I can move it to be next to me, I can win immediately. But that requires moving it, which might not be possible.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down. The ""win"" rule is far away. That might not be feasible.

Another idea: if I can make ""you is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's too far.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""you is win."" But that's a long move.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the win condition something else. For example, ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to reach the ball. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving in a specific direction and see if I can reach the key or win. Let me try moving right. If I move right, I might hit a wall, but if I can change the rules, maybe I can pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls will block me. But I don't want that. Maybe I can avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to change something else. For example, ""baba is stop,"" which would make me stop moving. That's not helpful.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""key is you,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create ""key is you."" The ""is"" rule at 4 up is alone. If I can move the ""key"" rule next to it and the ""you"" rule, I can make ""key is you.""

But moving the ""key"" rule that far might not be possible. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer to the ""is"" rule and the ""key"" rule.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I can move it to the right, I can get closer to the ""key"" rule. Let me try moving right a few times to get the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and the ""key"" rule.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try a different strategy. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition. The win is at 9 right and 5 up. There's a key at 7 right and 3 up and a door at 5 right and 3 up. So, I probably need the key to open the door to reach the win.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""wall"" rule at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that to be next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls block me. But I don't want that. Maybe I can move it elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, ""wall is move."" But I don't see a ""move"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving other rules.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that some of them are placed in a way that might block my path. I also see a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet. Maybe it stops me from moving through certain areas.

I also see a ball at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. I wonder if the ball is important. Maybe it's a distraction or part of another rule. I should keep an eye on it.

The rules on the map are interesting. There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change what counts as a wall. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. There's also another ""is"" rule at 4 steps up. Maybe I can combine these to make new rules.

I think my first step should be to move towards the key. If I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win. Let me plan my path. I need to move right several times to reach the key. But I have to be careful not to hit any walls or get stopped by the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I move up 3 steps, will I get stopped? I'm not sure. Maybe I should avoid moving up too much. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the ""stop"" rule not affect me.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me try to move right a few times to get closer to the key. Each time I move right, I'll check if I'm getting closer. If I hit a wall, I'll have to find another way around. Maybe I can move up or down to bypass the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move some rules around to create a new path. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I might be able to turn a wall into something else, like a passable object. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the key is the most important object right now. Without it, I can't open the door. So, I'll focus on getting to the key first. Let me try moving right a few times and see if I can reach it without hitting any walls or getting stopped.

If I get stuck, I'll have to think of another strategy, like changing the rules or manipulating the environment. But for now, I'll proceed towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice a key that's 1 step to the left. Maybe I need that key to open a door somewhere.

The door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The key is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the key is 1 step to the left. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check again.

Wait, in the current observation, the key is 1 step to the left. So it's near me. Maybe I can pick it up. But how? I think in Baba Is You, you can only interact with objects if you can reach them. So I need to move towards the key.

I'm currently at the starting position. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left to get it. But wait, moving left might take me into a wall. Let me check the walls around me. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but that's not directly blocking me. The walls are more to the right and up.

Wait, the rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So maybe I can move down first to get to the key. Let me see: if I move down, I can get to the rule `baba` which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I should move left to get the key. Let me try that. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So after getting the key, I can move right towards the door.

But wait, the door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So I need to move right and up to reach it. But there are walls in the way. Let me see: the walls are 3 steps to the right and various steps up. So moving right might be blocked by walls. Maybe I need to find a path around.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But I already have ""rule `stop` 3 step up."" Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the rule `stop` is 3 steps up. So if I can move that rule next to a wall, I can make that wall stop movement. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Another idea: maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer to me. The win rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's too far. If I can move it closer, I can reach it more easily.

But how do I move rules? I can only move text blocks if they're not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So I need to see if the ""win"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, I think it's movable unless it's defined as stop.

Wait, the rule `stop` is 3 steps up. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can make the ""win"" rule stop, but that doesn't help me.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving text blocks. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key would become controllable, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I have the key 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. Let me try that. So my first action should be to move left to get the key.

But wait, in the previous observations, moving left didn't work because of walls. Let me check the walls again. The walls are 3 steps to the right and various steps up, but I'm at the starting position, so moving left might not hit a wall immediately.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up first to get a better view. But the walls are 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, so moving up might not help.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The ball is 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure how.

Wait, the door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can get the key, I can open the door. So my priority is to get the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I should move left.

But in the previous attempt, moving left didn't work. Maybe I need to move down first to get around a wall. Let me see: moving down 1 step would take me to the rule `baba` which is 2 steps left and 1 step down. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get past the walls. But the walls are 3 steps to the right, so moving right might hit a wall.

Wait, the rule `wall` is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up. So if I can move that rule, I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control walls, but that might not help.

I think the best course of action is to move left to get the key. So I'll choose the left action.

There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that the rule ""wall"" is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that rule to change what counts as a wall. If I can make something else a wall, I might be able to clear a path.

I also see a ball at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. The rules are scattered around, so I might need to move some of them to create new rules or modify existing ones.

Let me think about the movement. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is the origin (0,0). The walls are to the right and up, so I need to move right and up to reach the win. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position to make a wall stop being a wall, thus creating a path.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule, which is at 3 steps up. If I can make the stop rule apply to something else, maybe I can move through what was previously a stop.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I move it, perhaps I can make it apply to a different object, allowing me to pass through walls or other obstacles.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and open the door. But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""baba."" Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, another at 4 steps up, and another at 1 step down. Maybe I can move one of these ""is"" rules to connect ""baba"" and ""key.""

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location, but that might not be necessary.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Move towards the ""is"" rule that's at 4 steps up. If I can move that, I can create a new rule like ""baba is key.""

2. Once ""baba is key"" is active, I can pick up the key, which is at 7 steps right and 3 up.

3. With the key, I can open the door at 5 steps right and 3 up.

4. Then, I can proceed to the win at 9 right and 5 up.

But wait, how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it next to ""baba"" and ""key."" Let me see where ""baba"" is. The rule ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I can create the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""baba is key.""

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. The walls are creating a sort of corridor to the right. The key is to the right, but behind walls. I need to find a way to either break through or bypass the walls.

Another approach: if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but that's already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" but that would make me a wall, which might not help.

Wait, if I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop rule wouldn't apply, and I could move through walls. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule on the map. Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""stop is you,"" which would mean I stop when I hit a stop, but that's already the case.

Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. To do that, I need to reach the key at 7 right and 3 up. But the walls are in the way. Let me see if I can move any walls or rules to create a path.

Looking at the walls, they are at 4 right and various up positions. If I can move a wall rule to a different position, I can make a wall stop being a wall, thus creating a path.

For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule at 1 left and 4 up to a different location, maybe I can make a wall at 4 right and 4 up stop being a wall, allowing me to pass.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location to make a wall stop being a stop, thus allowing me to pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it to a different location, say next to a wall, I can make that wall a stop, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule at 4 up to connect ""baba"" and ""key."" Let me see: if I move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""key,"" I can create ""baba is key,"" which would allow me to pick up the key.

So, the ""is"" rule is at 4 up. I need to move it to be next to ""baba"" and ""key."" Where is ""baba""? The rule ""baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down. The key is at 7 right and 3 up. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 4 up to a position where it's between ""baba"" and ""key.""

But that seems like a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule step by step. Let me plan the movements:

1. Move right to reach the ""is"" rule at 4 up.

2. Once there, move it to the left or right to connect with ""baba"" and ""key.""

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it, right? So I need to navigate to where the ""is"" rule is.

Let me see: I start at 0,0. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. That's far. Alternatively, there's another ""is"" rule at 4 up. That's closer. So, I can move up 4 steps to reach the ""is"" rule at 4 up.

Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to a position where it's next to ""baba"" and ""key."" But ""baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down, and ""key"" is at 7 right and 3 up. So, I need to find a midpoint.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is."" But the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a bit far.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key."" Let me try to move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to a position where it's between ""baba"" and ""key.""

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let me think again.

The win is at 9 right and 5 up. The key is at 7 right and 3 up. The door is at 5 right and 3 up. So, to get to the key, I need to go right and up, but walls are blocking the way.

If I can make the walls stop being walls, I can pass through. To do that, I need to change the rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that rule to a different position, I can make a wall stop being a wall.

For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to a position where it's next to a different object, like ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""nothing,"" but again, I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me see if I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location to make a wall stop being a stop, thus allowing me to pass.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it to a different location, say next to a wall, I can make that wall a stop, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is you,"" but that's already the case.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is stop,"" which would mean I stop when I hit a stop. But that's the default behavior.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule at 4 up to create a new rule. Let me try to move it next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to make ""baba is key.""

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 4 up to a position where it's between ""baba"" and ""key."" ""Baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down, and ""key"" is at 7 right and 3 up. So, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 3 right and 2 up, which is between them.

But how do I get there? Let me plan the movements:

1. Move up 4 steps to reach the ""is"" rule at 4 up.

2. Then, move left or right to position it between ""baba"" and ""key.""

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it, right? So I need to navigate to where the ""is"" rule is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is."" But the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a bit far.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to the position of the ""key"" rule. Let me see:

- The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. I need to move it to 7 right and 3 up.

But that's a long distance. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to a more accessible location.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. If I can move it to a position where it's next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" I can create ""baba is key.""

So, I need to move the ""key"" rule to a position where it's between ""baba"" and ""is."" ""Baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down, and ""is"" is at 4 up. So, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to 3 right and 2 up.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it, which is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can navigate there.

Let me plan the movements:

1. Move right 7 steps and up 3 steps to reach the ""key"" rule.

2. Then, move it to 3 right and 2 up.

But that seems like a lot of steps, and I might get blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to a position where it's next to ""baba"" and ""key.""

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 4 up is at 0,4. ""Baba"" is at -1,-1, and ""key"" is at 7,3. So, the midpoint would be around 3,1. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 3,1.

But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule from 0,4 to 3,1. That requires moving right 3 and down 3.

But I can only move one step at a time. Let me see:

- From 0,4, move right to 1,4.

- Then right to 2,4.

- Then right to 3,4.

- Then down to 3,3.

- Then down to 3,2.

- Then down to 3,1.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to the position of the ""key"" rule. Let me see:

- The ""is"" rule is at 0,4.

- The ""key"" rule is at 7,3.

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule right 7 and down 1.

But that's a lot of steps, and I might get blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to a position where it's next to ""baba"" and ""is.""

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 7,3. If I can move it to 3,2, which is between ""baba"" and ""is,"" I can create ""baba is key.""

So, I need to move the ""key"" rule from 7,3 to 3,2.

But how? I need to be adjacent to it to move it. So, I need to navigate to 7,3.

Let me plan the movements:

1. Move right 7 steps and up 3 steps to reach the ""key"" rule.

2. Then, move it left 4 steps and down 1 step to 3,2.

But I'm not sure if that's possible without getting blocked by walls.

Wait, looking at the walls, they are at 4 right and various up positions. So, moving right beyond 4 might be blocked.

Hmm, maybe I need to find a different approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you."" I need to change that to ""baba is key"" to pick up the key. Alternatively, I can make ""key is you"" to pick up the key.

Wait, if I can make ""key is you,"" then I can pick up the key. But how?

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule to be between ""key"" and ""you,"" I can create ""key is you.""

The ""key"" rule is at 7,3. The ""you"" rule is at 1,-1. So, the midpoint would be around 4,1. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 4,1.

But again, that's a long distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 4 up (0,4) to 4,1.

So, from 0,4, move right 4 and down 3.

But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""key"" and ""is."" The ""you"" rule is at 1,-1. If I can move it to 7,3, I can create ""key is you.""

But that's a long distance as well.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to 7,3 to create ""key is you.""

So, from 0,4, move right 7 and down 1 to 7,3.

But I'm not sure if that's possible without getting blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 1 down (0,-1) to 7,3.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 1 down is at 0,-1. If I can move it to 7,3, I can create ""key is you.""

But that's a long distance, and I might get blocked.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me think about the ball.

The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is you,"" I can control the ball and maybe use it to break through walls. But how?

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""you."" The ""ball"" is at 1,4. The ""you"" rule is at 1,-1. So, the midpoint would be around 1,1. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 1,1.

But the ""is"" rule is at 0,4. So, I need to move it down 3 steps to 0,1, then right to 1,1.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you."" The ""ball"" is at 1,4. If I can move it to 1,-1, I can create ""ball is you.""

But that's a long distance, and I might get blocked.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 4 up to 1,4 to create ""ball is you.""

So, from 0,4, move right 1 to 1,4.

Then, the rule becomes ""ball is you,"" allowing me to control the ball.

But I'm not sure if that helps me reach the key and win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is key,"" allowing me to pick up the key with the ball.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule","

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a door, a key, and some other things. The ""WIN"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a ""key"" at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""door"" at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out if I can move through them or if I can change the rules to make them passable.

I also see a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make the walls stop being solid or something. There's a ""ball"" at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule.

The rules on the map include ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" I can move these rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to a wall, I can make the wall stop moving or become passable.

I think the key is to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. Maybe if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop being solid, letting me walk through them. Alternatively, I could make ""baba is win"" to change the win condition, but that might not be necessary here.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ""key"" first, which is at 7 right and 3 up. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall to make it stop. Or perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""wall,"" I can create ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop moving or become passable. That might help me get through.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to create ""baba is key,"" which would let me pick up the key without needing to interact with it normally. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

I think the best course is to move towards the ""stop"" rule and then use it to modify the walls. Let me try moving right to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Once I'm next to it, I can move it to create a new rule that helps me pass through walls.

So, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""stop"" rule. Each step right brings me closer. Once I'm adjacent, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it next to a wall to create ""wall is stop."" That should make the walls passable.

After that, I can move through the walls, grab the key, and then proceed to the door. With the key, I can open the door and reach the ""WIN"" object.

I need to make sure I don't get stuck. If I can't move through the walls, I might need to find another way, maybe by changing the win condition or using the ball to push something.

But for now, I'll focus on moving right to get to the ""stop"" rule and then use it to modify the walls. That seems like the most straightforward path to victory.

There's also a ""key"" at 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door. The ""door"" is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so I might need the key to get through it.

I notice that there are several ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

The ball is at 4 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used somehow, maybe to push other objects or break through walls. But since I'm Baba, I can only move myself, so I might need to figure out how to use the ball indirectly.

The key is at 1 step to the left, which is close to me. If I can pick up the key, I can open the door. But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can usually pick up objects by moving into them. So maybe I should move left to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. After opening the door, I can proceed further right towards the win condition. But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. There are walls at various positions, so I need to navigate around them.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I move into that, it might stop me, so I need to avoid it. Maybe I can move around it by going up or down.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move left to get the key. Then, move right towards the door, open it with the key, and continue moving right towards the win. But I have to be careful with the walls and the stop rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""win"" to change the win condition to something else, but that might complicate things. I think the straightforward approach is to get the key, open the door, and proceed to the win.

So, my first step should be to move left to pick up the key. That way, I can open the door and continue towards the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out if I can move through them or if I can change the rules to make them passable.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move around unless walls are defined as stop.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can combine that with the wall rule, maybe I can make walls stop movement. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

There's also a ""ball"" at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure how.

Let me think about the path. To get to the win at 9 right and 5 up, I need to move right a lot. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move the wall rules to change their properties.

I see a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up. If I can move that to combine with the wall rule, maybe I can redefine walls. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push walls. Or ""wall is you,"" but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" so they disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here. Hmm.

Wait, there's a ""key"" at 7 right and 3 up. To get to the key, I need to move right 7 steps and up 3. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the wall rules to clear a path.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key first. So, I'll start moving right. But I have to avoid walls. Let me see the walls' positions:

- wall 4 steps right and 5 up
- wall 4 right and 4 up
- wall 4 right and 3 up
- wall 4 right and 2 up
- wall 4 right and 1 up
- wall 4 right
- wall 4 right and 1 down

So, along the 4th column (4 steps right), there are walls from up 5 down to 1 down. That's a solid column of walls. I can't go through that. So, I need to go around.

Maybe I can go up first, then right. Let me see:

I start at some position, let's say (0,0). To get to the key at (7,3), I need to move right 7 and up 3. But the walls are at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), etc. So, if I go up first, maybe I can go above the walls.

Wait, but the walls are at 4 right and various up positions. If I go up to 5, I can move right beyond 4. Let me try:

1. Move up to (0,5).
2. Then move right to (4,5), but there's a wall there. Can't move into a wall unless I change the rules.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the wall rules first. Let me look at the rule blocks:

- rule `is` at 8 right and 5 up
- rule `win` at 9 right and 5 up
- rule `wall` at 1 left and 4 up
- rule `is` at 4 up
- rule `stop` at 3 up
- rule `door` at 5 right and 3 up
- rule `key` at 7 right and 3 up
- rule `baba` at 1 left and 1 down
- rule `is` at 1 down
- rule `you` at 1 right and 1 down

So, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that to combine with another rule, I can redefine walls. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""push,"" I can make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls.

But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule. Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move the rule blocks if they are not defined as stop. Right now, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, but it's not combined with anything, so walls are not stop unless defined.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, but it's not part of any rule. So, unless a wall is defined as stop, I can move through them. So, maybe I can move through walls because they are not defined as stop yet.

Wait, no. The default is that walls are solid unless redefined. So, I can't move through walls unless I change the rules.

So, I need to redefine walls. Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule to combine with ""is"" and ""push."" The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""wall"" rule to be next to ""is"" at 4 up, then I can create ""wall is push.""

How do I move the ""wall"" rule? It's at 1 left and 4 up. So, from my starting position, I need to move left 1 and up 4 to get to it. But I'm not sure where I start. Let's assume I start at (0,0).

To get to the ""wall"" rule at (-1,4), I need to move left once and up four times. But moving left from (0,0) would take me to (-1,0), but there might be walls in the way. Wait, the walls are at 4 right, so moving left from 0 is okay.

So, step by step:

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. Move up four times to (-1,4), where the ""wall"" rule is.
3. Now, I can push or move the ""wall"" rule. I need to move it next to the ""is"" rule at (8,5). Wait, no, the ""is"" rule is at 4 up, which is (0,4). Wait, no, the ""is"" rule is at 4 up, which is (0,4). So, I need to move the ""wall"" rule from (-1,4) to (0,4) to combine with ""is.""

Wait, but the ""is"" rule is at 4 up, which is (0,4). So, if I move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), it will form ""wall is [something]."" But what's next to it? If I move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), and there's an ""is"" rule there, then I can create ""wall is something.""

But I need to define what ""wall is."" Maybe I can move the ""push"" rule next to it. Wait, is there a ""push"" rule? I don't see one listed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" but that would make walls controllable, which might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""wall is stop."" That way, walls block movement, but I already can't move through them. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, perhaps I can make ""wall is win."" That would make walls the win condition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""ball"" at (1,4). If I can make the ball push walls, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to combine with walls. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, which is (0,3). If I move the ""wall"" rule to (0,3), then ""wall is stop,"" making walls block movement. But that's the default, so it might not help.

Wait, maybe I can make ""stop is you,"" allowing me to move through stop blocks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is stop,"" but that would stop me.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me look at the key and door. The key is at (7,3), and the door is at (5,3). So, to get to the key, I need to pass through the door, which requires the key. Wait, that's a problem. I need the key to open the door, but the key is behind the door. So, I need another way.

Wait, maybe I can redefine the door. The door rule is at (5,3). If I can change the door's property, maybe I can open it without the key.

How? If I can move the ""door"" rule to combine with ""is"" and ""open,"" but I don't see an ""open"" rule. Alternatively, make ""door is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" rule.

Alternatively, make ""door is you,"" so I can walk through it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make ""door is push,"" allowing me to push it. But again, no ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" so I can pick up the key. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is at (7,3). If I can reach it without going through the door, maybe I can go around. But the walls are blocking the way.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right, so maybe I can go above them. Let me see:

If I move up to (0,5), then right to (4,5), but there's a wall there. So, I can't go through. Unless I change the wall rules.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make walls passable. For example, ""wall is nothing."" But I don't have a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, ""wall is air,"" but I don't see an ""air"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is push,"" but without a ""push"" rule, I can't push them.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" so I can walk through them. But that might not be safe.

Wait, let me try to move the ""wall"" rule. It's at (-1,4). I can move it to (0,4), combining with ""is"" to make ""wall is [something]."" But what's next to (0,4)? There's a ""ball"" at (1,4). So, if I move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), and then move the ""ball"" next to it, I can make ""wall is ball."" Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (0,4) to combine with ""wall."" Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (0,4), and the ""wall"" rule is at (-1,4). So, if I move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), it will form ""wall is [next rule]."" But what's next? Maybe I can move another rule next to it.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at (9,5). If I can combine ""wall"" with ""win,"" making ""wall is win,"" but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is push"" by moving the ""push"" rule next to it, but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (0,3). If I can combine it with something else, maybe I can stop certain objects.

Wait, if I make ""stop is you,"" then I can stop myself, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, ""stop is wall,"" making walls stop movement, but that's already the case.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is stop,"" but that would prevent me from moving.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is stop,"" so the ball stops movement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is at (1,4). If I can make ""ball is push,"" I can push it to clear a path. But again, no ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to combine with ""is"" and ""you."" The ""ball"" is at (1,4). If I move it to (0,4), it would form ""ball is [something]."" But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at (0,4) to combine with ""ball."" So, ""ball is [something].""

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move right as much as possible and see where I can go.

From (0,0), I can move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), but at (4,0), there's a wall. So, I can't go further right on the bottom row.

So, I need to go up first. Let me move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), but at (4,1), there's a wall. Same problem.

Alternatively, go up to (0,2), right to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), but (4,2) is a wall.

Same at (0,3): right to (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), but (4,3) is a wall.

At (0,4): right to (1,4), which is the ball. So, I can move to (1,4).

From (1,4), I can move up to (1,5), but there's a wall at (4,5). So, I can't go further up.

Wait, but the ""win"" rule is at (9,5). So, I need to get to the far right.

Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. It's at (9,5). If I can move it to (0,5), then I can win by moving up. But how?

To move the ""win"" rule, I need to be next to it. But it's at (9,5), which is far away. I can't reach it without moving through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can redefine the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you."" If I can make ""baba is win,"" then whenever I am, I win. But I need to combine the ""baba"" rule with ""is"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,1). The ""is"" rule is at (0,4). The ""win"" rule is at (9,5). So, I need to move them together, but that's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" so being me wins the level. But I need to combine ""you"" with ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is at (1,1). So, if I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""you is win.""

But that's also far away.

Hmm, this is really challenging. Maybe I need to break down the problem.

First, I need to get past the walls at column 4. To do that, I need to redefine walls. The ""wall"" rule is at (-1,4). If I can move it to combine with ""is"" and ""push,"" I can make ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls.

But I don't have a ""push"" rule. Wait, maybe I can create a ""push"" rule by combining ""is"" and ""push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule on the map.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""ball"" as a pusher. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to push walls.

But again, no ""push"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball and use it to push walls. Let's try that.

The ""ball"" is at (1,4). The ""is"" rule is at (0,4). The ""you"" rule is at (1,1). So, if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I can make ""ball is you.""

But that's a lot of moving. Let me see:

1. Move to (1,4) where the ball is.
2. Move the ""ball"" rule to (0,4), combining with ""is"" to make ""ball is [something].""
3. Then move the ""you"" rule to (0,4) to make ""ball is you.""

But the ""you"" rule is at (1,1). So, I need to move it up to (0,4). That's a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at (1,1). The ""ball"" is at (1,4). So, if I can move the ""you"" rule up to (1,4), then combine it with ""is"" and ""ball,"" I can make ""you is ball.""

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that some of them are placed in a way that might form a barrier. I also see a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. I'm not sure what that does yet.

I have the ball at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure how. The rules are scattered around, and I can move them if they're not ""stop"" or ""wall."" 

I think the key is to get the key first. To do that, I need to move right. But there are walls in the way. Let me see if I can move around them. If I go up first, maybe I can bypass some walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules, I might change how Baba behaves. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can stop some walls or other objects. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Hmm, maybe I can go up first to avoid it. 

If I move up, I can get to the area where the rules are. Maybe I can pick up a rule and change something. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that would help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I push the ball into a wall, maybe it will break. But I'm not sure if that's possible in this setup.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try moving right first and see if I can get past the walls. If I can't, maybe I need to find another way. 

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I need the key to open it. So, I need to get the key first. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I need to move right to get to the key, but there are walls blocking the way.

Maybe I can move up to a higher position and then move right. Let me try moving up a few steps and then right. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule to make the walls passable. If I can change the rule, maybe the walls won't block me anymore. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think I'll try moving right first and see if I can navigate around the walls. If that doesn't work, I'll look into manipulating the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out a path that avoids the walls or uses the rules to change the environment.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up, and another ""is"" rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move these to change the properties of walls or other objects.

The ball is at 4 steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. Maybe it's just an obstacle or maybe it can be used somehow.

The key is at 1 step to the left. So, it's near me. If I can pick up the key, I might be able to open the door. But how do I get to the key? There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, so maybe I can move around it.

Wait, the key is at 1 step to the left, but I'm at the starting position. So, I can move left to get the key. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path. The wall is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, so moving left from my position shouldn't be blocked by that wall.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But to get there, I might need to move up and right, avoiding the walls. There's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up, which might prevent me from moving through that area. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location or change it.

Alternatively, I could try to change the rules to make walls passable or to turn something else into a win condition. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would end the level. But I need to see if that's possible.

Looking at the rule blocks, I can move them to create new rules. For instance, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule, I can create ""key is win."" That would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to pick up the key, and the level would end.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule to create ""key is win."" Then, move to the key to win the level.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be next to it. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is far away. Maybe I can move towards it step by step.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me see the exact positions:

- I'm at (0,0) assuming the starting point is the origin.
- The ""is"" rule is at (7,5).
- The ""key"" is at (-1,3) because it's 1 step to the left and 3 steps up.

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first since it's closer. If I can get the key, I can then figure out how to use it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I move it next to ""is,"" I can make ""baba is something else,"" but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to something else, I can change what ""you"" is. For example, making ""you is key"" would mean I can pick up the key by moving into it.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe it's simpler to just move towards the key and see if I can pick it up, then proceed to the door and win.

Let me try to move left to get the key. So, my first action should be to move left.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That seems pretty far. There's also a ""key"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 up, and a ""door"" at 5 right and 3 up. Hmm, maybe I need to get the key to open the door to reach the win.

But wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. I think that means if I move into that area, I might get stopped. I need to avoid that or find a way around it. Also, there are several walls around, which are probably blocking my path.

I see a ""ball"" at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure how yet. There's also a ""baba"" rule 1 step left and 1 down, and ""you"" 1 step right and 1 down. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change my properties or the environment.

I think the key is to get the key and then go through the door. But how do I get past the walls and the stop rule? Maybe I can move some text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, but that might not be necessary. Let me try to move towards the key first. I need to navigate around the walls and avoid the stop rule.

I should probably move right to get closer to the key. Let me try moving right a few times. But wait, there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move up or down to go around them. Let me check the positions again.

The walls are at various positions, but I think if I move up, I can go around the walls. Let me try moving up first to get a better path. Once I'm in a clear area, I can move right towards the key.

After getting the key, I can then approach the door. Since I have the key, maybe the door will open, allowing me to reach the win. But I need to make sure I don't trigger any stop rules along the way.

I think the best course of action is to move up to avoid the walls and then move right towards the key. Once I have the key, I can proceed to the door and then to the win. Let me try moving up first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are some rules: ""is"" at 8 right and 4 up, ""win"" at 9 right and 4 up, and ""wall"" at 1 left and 3 up. There's also another ""is"" rule at 3 up. A ball is at 1 right and 3 up. More walls are at 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, and 4 right. A key is at 1 down, and another wall is at 4 right and 1 down. The rules ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" are positioned at 1 left and 2 down, 2 down, and 1 right and 2 down respectively. Finally, a wall is at 4 right and 2 down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to move Baba to reach the win condition. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The win rule is at 9 right and 4 up, which is pretty far. I need to see if there are any obstacles or if I can manipulate the rules to make it easier.

First, I should check if there are any stop rules that might prevent me from moving. I see a ""stop"" rule at 2 up. That could block movement if I'm not careful. Also, there are walls in various positions, so I need to navigate around them.

The key is at 1 down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. There's a ""door"" rule at 5 right and 2 up, and a ""key"" rule at 7 right and 2 up. So, perhaps I need to get the key to change the door's property.

Wait, the key is at 1 down, which is directly below me. If I move down, I can pick it up. But I need to make sure that moving down is possible. Let me see the positions again. The key is at 1 down, and there's a wall at 4 right and 1 down. So, if I'm at the starting position, moving down once would take me to where the key is.

After picking up the key, I can then move towards the door. The door is at 5 right and 2 up. So, I need to move right 5 steps and up 2 steps. But I have to avoid the walls. Let me plan the path.

Starting position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0). The key is at (0,-1). So, moving down once gets me the key. Then, I need to move right 5 steps and up 2 steps. But I have to check if there are walls in that path.

Looking at the walls: There's a wall at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, and 4 right. So, moving right 4 steps is blocked by walls at various heights. That might be a problem.

Wait, maybe I can break through the walls by changing the rules. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can make the walls passable. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can make the walls stop being walls.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I need to move the text block. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP."" The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up, so I need to avoid that.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule. There are multiple ""is"" rules. If I can combine them with other words, I can create new properties.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. That's far, but maybe if I can change the win condition, I can make it easier. For example, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up, and the key is at 1 down. That's a long distance. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, I can try to make the door passable by using the key. The door is at 5 right and 2 up, and the key is at 1 down. If I pick up the key, maybe I can open the door.

But to get to the door, I need to move right 5 steps and up 2 steps. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so moving right 4 steps is blocked. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, and 4 right. So, moving right 4 steps is blocked at all levels. That means I can't go straight right. Maybe I can go up first and then right.

Starting at (0,0), if I move up, I can go to (0,1), (0,2), etc. Let me see the walls at higher positions. At 4 right and 4 up, there's a wall. So, if I move up 4 steps, I can go to (0,4), then right 4 steps would hit the wall. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right 3 steps and then up. Let's see: moving right 3 steps would take me to (3,0). Then up 1 step to (3,1), but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up, so moving right from (3,1) to (4,1) is blocked. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at (0,-1). If I move down to get it, then I can have the key. Then, maybe I can use the key to open the door. The door is at (5,2). So, from (0,-1), I need to move right 5 steps and up 3 steps. But the walls are in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" rule is at 5 right and 2 up. If I can move it next to the key, then perhaps the key can open it. But I'm not sure how that works.

Wait, in Baba Is You, if you have a key, you can open a door. So, if I pick up the key, I can move through the door. So, I need to get to the door, which is at (5,2). But the path is blocked by walls at (4, y) for various y.

Maybe I can change the walls into something else. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but that's already the case. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become passable.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? It's at 1 left and 3 up, which is (-1,3). I need to move there. But to get to (-1,3), I have to move left from my starting position, which might not be possible if there are walls.

Wait, the starting position is (0,0). Moving left would take me to (-1,0), but is there a wall there? The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0) might be possible.

So, plan:

1. Move left to (-1,0).
2. From there, move up to (-1,1), (-1,2), (-1,3) to reach the ""wall"" rule.
3. Once I'm at (-1,3), I can move the ""wall"" rule by moving in a direction, which would change the rule.

But wait, can I move the ""wall"" rule? In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by moving into them. So, if I'm at (-1,3), I can move into the ""wall"" rule, which would allow me to move it.

If I move the ""wall"" rule to a new position, I can redefine what walls are. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""stop,"" making ""wall is stop,"" but that's already the case. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is nothing,"" which would remove their blocking property.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to walk through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is win,"" which would make all walls win conditions. But that might not help.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to get the key first. The key is at (0,-1). So, move down once to pick it up. Then, with the key, I can open the door at (5,2).

But the path to the door is blocked by walls at (4,y). So, I need to find a way around. Maybe I can go up first, then right.

From (0,-1), move up to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). Then right to (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), but at (4,4) there's a wall. So, I can't go further right.

Alternatively, from (0,4), move right 3 steps to (3,4), then down to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1). But that seems convoluted.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up, which is (0,2). If I can move it, I can change what stops movement. For example, making ""stop is nothing"" would remove the stopping effect.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to get to (0,2). From (0,0), I can move up twice to (0,2). Then, I can move the ""stop"" rule by moving into it.

If I move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, say next to ""is"" and ""win,"" making ""stop is win,"" which would make the stop rule a win condition. But that might not help.

Alternatively, I can make ""stop is you,"" which would allow me to move through stop rules. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see the key is at (0,-1). If I pick it up, I can open the door at (5,2). But the path is blocked. Maybe I can move the door rule.

The ""door"" rule is at (5,2). If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can create a new door elsewhere. But I need to get to (5,2) to move it, which is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""wall is nothing."" To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""nothing."" But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can create ""wall is you."" If I can make walls passable, I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you.""

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down, which is (1,-2). So, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to (1,-2), making ""wall is you,"" then walls become passable.

But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule from (-1,3) to (1,-2). That's a long distance, and I might encounter walls along the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""is."" The ""you"" rule is at (1,-2). If I can move it to (-1,3), next to ""wall"" and ""is,"" then ""you is wall,"" which would make me a wall. Not sure if that helps.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at (9,4). If I can move it to a more accessible position, I can win without going all the way to (9,4).

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to get to (9,4), which is blocked by walls. So, that's not feasible.

Wait, maybe I can create a new win condition. For example, ""key is win."" If I can make the key the win condition, then picking it up would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at (7,2). So, if I can move the ""win"" rule from (9,4) to (7,2), making ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level.

But moving the ""win"" rule from (9,4) to (7,2) requires navigating through walls, which might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""key"" rule is at (7,2). If I can move it to (9,4), making ""key is win,"" then the same effect.

But again, the path is blocked.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to get the key first. Move down to (0,-1) to pick up the key. Then, see if I can find a path to the door at (5,2).

From (0,-1), I can move up to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). At (0,2), there's a ""stop"" rule. So, moving further up from (0,2) would be blocked. So, I can't go up beyond (0,2).

Alternatively, from (0,2), I can move right. Let's see: from (0,2), right to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2). But at (4,2), there's a wall. So, I can't go further right.

Wait, but I have the key. Maybe the door at (5,2) can be opened from a distance? Or maybe I need to be adjacent to it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the door rule. If I can move the ""door"" rule from (5,2) to a more accessible position, I can open it with the key.

But to move the ""door"" rule, I need to get to (5,2), which is blocked by walls.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to find another way. Let's look at the other rules. There's a ""ball"" at (1,3). Maybe the ball can be used somehow. If I can move the ball into a position that changes the rules, it might help.

But I'm not sure how. The ball is just an object unless I can make it part of a rule.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at (1,3). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create a new rule like ""ball is something."" But I'm not sure what that would achieve.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so hitting the ball would win the level. But I don't know if that's possible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop rule won't block me. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule from (0,2) to a position where it's next to ""is"" and ""nothing."" But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can create ""stop is you,"" which would allow me to move through stop rules. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you.""

The ""you"" rule is at (1,-2). So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to (1,-2), making ""stop is you,"" then I can pass through stop rules.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to get to (0,2), which is possible. From (0,2), I can move the ""stop"" rule down to (0,1), (0,0), etc., but I need to get it to (1,-2). That's a long way down and right.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to (0,2), making ""you is stop,"" which would make me stop when I move. Not helpful.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see the key is at (0,-1). If I pick it up, I can open the door at (5,2). But the path is blocked. Maybe I can go around the walls.

From (0,-1), move right to (1,-1), (2,-1), (3,-1), (4,-1). But at (4,-1), there's a wall. So, I can't go further right.

Alternatively, from (0,-1), move up to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). At (0,2), I'm blocked by the ""stop"" rule. So, I can't go up further.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down. If I can move it from (0,2) to (0,1), then I can go up to (0,2). But I need to move the ""stop"" rule first.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be at (0,2). From (0,0), I can move up twice to (0,2). Then, I can move the ""stop"" rule down to (0,1). Now, the ""stop"" rule is at (0,1), which blocks movement there. But I can move around it.

Wait, if I move the ""stop"" rule to (0,1), then moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is blocked. So,","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are several rules: ""is"" at 8 right and 4 up, ""win"" at 9 right and 4 up, and ""wall"" at 1 left and 3 up. There's also another ""is"" rule at 3 up. A ball is at 1 right and 3 up. More walls are at 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, and 4 right. A key is 1 step down, and some more walls and rules are below.

I think the key is important because it might open a door. The door is at 5 right and 2 up, and the key is at 7 right and 2 up. So I need to get the key to open the door. But how do I move? I can move up, down, left, right, or idle.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right and 3 up. Maybe I can push the ball somewhere. But I'm not sure. The walls are blocking my way. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up, which might mean that certain objects can't move through it.

I need to figure out how to get to the key. Let me see the positions. The key is at 7 right and 2 up. I'm currently at some position, but I'm not sure where exactly. Maybe I should move right to get closer to the key.

But there are walls in the way. The wall is at 4 right and 4 up, so maybe I can go around. If I move up first, maybe I can go over the walls. Or perhaps I can break a rule to make the walls passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push through walls. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules together. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right a few times to get closer. But I have to avoid the walls. Maybe I can move up to bypass them.

Wait, the key is at 7 right and 2 up. I'm currently at 0,0 perhaps. So I need to move right 7 steps and up 2 steps. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can find a path around.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will break. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can get past the walls. Let me try moving up once.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 2 steps down, which might be useful if there's a door blocking the way. Doors are often locked and require keys to open.

I see a ""door"" rule 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, to get to the win, I might need to go through the door, which would require the key. The key is 2 steps down, so I need to move down to get it.

But wait, there are walls in the way. Walls are usually immovable unless I change the rules. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make the walls passable or remove them.

I also notice a ""stop"" rule 1 step up. That probably means if I move into that area, I can't go further. So I need to avoid that or find a way to change it.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Balls can sometimes be pushed, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So, my plan is to first move down to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it. After that, I can proceed towards the win. But I need to make sure I can move through any walls or obstacles along the way.

Let me check the path. To get the key, I need to move down twice. Then, from there, I can move right towards the door. Once I have the key, the door should open, allowing me to pass. Then, I can move up towards the win.

I should also be cautious of the ""stop"" rule. If I move into that area, I might get stuck, so I need to navigate around it.

Alternatively, if the walls are too much of a problem, I might need to rearrange the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to say ""wall is stop,"" that might prevent me from moving through them, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can make ""wall is you"" to turn them into passable objects.

But for now, I'll focus on getting the key first. So, I'll move down twice to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I'll move right towards the door. Then, I'll use the key to open the door and proceed to the win.

Wait, but how do I actually use the key? In Baba Is You, sometimes you just need to be adjacent to the door with the key. So, once I have the key, moving into the door's position should open it.

So, step by step:

1. Move down twice to get the key.
2. Move right towards the door.
3. Move into the door's position to open it.
4. Move up towards the win.

I think that's the plan. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are several rules placed around: ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" etc. There's also a ball and a key involved.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's pretty far. To get there, I might need to move through the map, but there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, so I need to figure out a path around them.

Wait, there's a key 1 step down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open a door. The door is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed further.

But how do I get to the key? It's 1 step down from my current position. Let me check if there's a wall blocking me. The wall is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, so maybe I can move down to get the key without hitting a wall.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. After opening the door, I can move further right towards the ""win"" rule.

But wait, there are other rules like ""stop"" and ""wall"" that might affect my movement. I need to make sure I don't step on any ""stop"" rules, as they would prevent me from moving. Also, the ""wall"" rules define what's considered a wall, so I shouldn't move those unless I want to change the layout.

I think the best approach is to first move down to pick up the key. Then, move right to the door, use the key to open it, and proceed towards the ""win"" rule. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move down to get the key.
2. Move right towards the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Continue moving right towards the ""win"" rule.

I need to make sure each move is valid and doesn't hit any walls or stop rules. Let me visualize the map:

- Starting position: Let's say I'm at (0,0).
- Wall at (4,4).
- Key at (0,-1).
- Door at (5,2).
- Win at (9,4).

So, moving down from (0,0) to (0,-1) to get the key. Then right to (5,-1), but wait, there's a wall at (4,1). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, after getting the key, move up to (0,0), then right to (5,0), then up to (5,2) to open the door. Then proceed right to (9,4) to win.

I think that's a feasible path. So the first step is to move down to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There's also a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. There's another ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 4 up, which might be useful for creating new walls or modifying existing ones.

There's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break them. I should keep that in mind. There's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up, which probably makes objects stop moving. The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps right and 3 up, and the ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need to get the key to proceed.

The key is at 7 steps right and 3 up, which is a bit to the right and up. There's also a key at 1 step left, which is closer. Maybe I can grab that key first. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, which might allow me to change Baba's properties if I move it.

I think the strategy here is to move towards the key to unlock the door, then proceed towards the win condition. But I need to figure out the path. Let me see the layout:

- The walls are mostly on the right side, creating a sort of barrier. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, which might be in the way. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can prevent it from stopping me.

- The ""is"" rule at 4 up is in the middle, which I can use to create new rules. Maybe I can move it to combine with other rules.

- The ""door"" is at 5 right and 3 up, so I need to get past it. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, so I need to go right and up to get it.

Wait, but the key is also at 1 step left. That's closer. Maybe I can move left to get the key first. Let me check the positions:

- I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably near the bottom. The key is 1 step left, so I can move left to grab it.

- Once I have the key, I can go to the door at 5 right and 3 up. But to get there, I need to move right and up, avoiding the walls.

- The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so I need to navigate around them.

- The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, which might block my path. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can prevent it from stopping me.

- The ""is"" rule at 4 up can be used to create new rules. Maybe I can move it to combine with ""win"" or ""door"" to change the win condition or unlock the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. If I move ""baba"" to ""is"" something else, I can gain abilities like jumping or pushing.

But for now, let's focus on getting the key. I'll move left to grab the key. Once I have the key, I can proceed to the door. Then, I can go through the door and move towards the win rule at 9 right and 5 up.

Wait, but the win rule is at 9 right and 5 up, which is quite far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, so if I can move it left, I can make it the win condition when I reach it.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me try to get the key first. So, I'll move left to grab the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, open it, and proceed towards the win.

Wait, but the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So after getting the key, I need to move right and up to reach the door. Let me plan the path:

1. Move left to grab the key at 1 step left.
2. Move right to go back towards the center.
3. Move up to reach the door at 5 right and 3 up.
4. Use the key to open the door.
5. Proceed through the door and move towards the win rule.

But I need to make sure I don't hit any walls or get stopped by the ""stop"" rule. Let me check the walls:

- Walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so I need to navigate around them.

- The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, which might be in the way. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can prevent it from stopping me.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule out of the way before proceeding. Let me see:

- The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it down or to the side, I can clear the path.

But moving rules requires me to have the ""is"" rule in the correct position. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are:

- There's an ""is"" rule at 8 right and 5 up, and another at 4 up.

I think the best approach is to first move left to grab the key, then proceed to the door, and then move towards the win rule. Let's try that.

So, the first action is to move left to grab the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""WIN"" rule at 10 steps right and 5 up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" at 8 steps right and 3 up, and a ""door"" at 6 steps right and 3 up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up. That might block my path. I also see a ""ball"" at 2 steps right and 4 up. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. There are walls all around, so I need to navigate carefully.

I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably near the bottom. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step down, so maybe I can move down a bit. The ""is"" and ""you"" rules are also nearby, which might be useful for changing rules.

I think the first step is to move towards the key. To get to the key at 8 right and 3 up, I need to go right several times. But there are walls in the way. Let me see the path: walls are at 5 right and various up steps. So, maybe I can go up first to avoid them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I move right once, I might hit the stop. That's bad because I can't move through stop. Maybe I should go up first to bypass that.

Alternatively, maybe I can break the stop rule by moving the ""is"" or ""you"" blocks. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me think about the rules. If I can rearrange the rules, I might be able to change what stop does or remove it.

But for now, maybe the simplest path is to go up as much as possible to avoid the walls and stop. Let me try moving up first. So, I'll take the ""up"" action to move one step up. That should help me navigate around the walls and get closer to the key and door.

Wait, but if I move up, I might get closer to the ""WIN"" rule, which is way up. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""baba"" and ""win"" together. But that might be complicated. For now, moving up seems safer to avoid obstacles.

So, I'll choose to move up to start navigating towards the key and door without hitting any stops or walls.

I notice there's a ""door"" rule 6 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Doors usually require keys to open, so maybe I need to get the key first. The key is closer, so I should probably go for that first.

To get to the key, I need to move right once and down once. But I have to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, but I'm moving right 1 and down 1, so I should be okay.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. If I move right once, I'll be at (1,0). Then down once would take me to (1,-1). Is there a wall there? The wall is at 5 steps right and 1 step up, so that's (5,1). I'm moving to (1,-1), which is clear. So I can safely move down to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can probably open the door. The door is at 6 right and 2 up. So after getting the key, I need to move further right and up. But I also need to make sure the path is clear. There are walls at various positions, but I think with the key, I can navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make things easier. For example, if I can move the ""WIN"" rule closer, that would help. But that might require more steps. Since the key is closer, it's probably better to get that first.

So, my plan is to move down to get the key. That should help me progress towards the door and eventually the win condition.

Hmm, I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The key is nearby, so maybe I can pick it up. If I have the key, I can open doors, which might help me get to the win object.

Wait, there's a door at 6 right and 3 up. To open it, I need the key. So first, I should move towards the key. The key is 1 step to the right, so I can move right once to get it. But before that, I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path.

Looking at the walls, there's one at 5 right and 5 up, but that's above me. The walls at 5 right and 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, and 1 step down don't seem to block my immediate path to the key. So I can safely move right to get the key.

Once I have the key, I can move towards the door. The door is at 6 right and 3 up, so I'll need to move right a few more times and maybe up or down to reach it. But first, I need to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps right and 3 up, and a door at 5 right and 3 up. So maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out a path that avoids the walls or uses the rules to change the environment.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 4 up, which might mean that if I move that, I can change what counts as a wall. The ""is"" and ""you"" rules are also present, which could be used to change my properties or the win condition.

Hmm, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition to something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but if I can change that, maybe I can move through them.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer or change it to something else. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Let me think about the ball. It's at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe it's a distraction or part of a puzzle. If I can move the ball, perhaps it can trigger something.

I also notice that the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I move that, I could change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key and open the door.

Wait, that might be a good idea. If I can change the rule to ""baba is key,"" then I can move to the key's position and pick it up. Then, I can go to the door and open it to reach the win.

So, how do I change the rule? I need to move the ""is"" and ""key"" blocks next to ""baba."" The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up, and ""key"" is at 7 right and 3 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move them closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""key"" is. But that might not be straightforward.

Wait, another approach: if I can make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, and I can move through it. But I'm not sure if that's the right path.

Let me try to plan step by step. First, I need to get the key to open the door. To do that, I might need to change my own properties. So, moving the ""is"" and ""key"" next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is key.""

But how do I move those rules? I can only move text blocks that aren't defined as ""STOP."" So I need to check if the ""is"" and ""key"" rules are movable.

Assuming they are, I can move the ""is"" rule down to where ""baba"" is. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up, so moving it down a few steps to meet ""baba.""

Once ""baba is key"" is formed, I can move to the key's position, which is at 7 right and 3 up. Then, I can pick up the key and proceed to the door at 5 right and 3 up.

After opening the door, I can move further right to reach the win at 9 right and 5 up.

But wait, there are walls in the way. I need to make sure the path is clear. Maybe I can break some walls by changing their rules.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current rules.

Another thought: if I can move the ""stop"" rule, which is at 3 steps up, to make ""wall is stop,"" but that would make walls block movement, which is the default. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule here. So maybe that's not an option.

Perhaps the key is to focus on getting the key first. So, I'll try to change ""baba is key"" by moving the ""is"" and ""key"" rules next to ""baba.""

So, first, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 4 steps up to where ""baba"" is, which is 1 step left and 1 step down. That would require moving the ""is"" rule down 5 steps (since it's at 4 up, moving down 5 would put it at 1 down). But that might not be possible in one move.

Wait, each action is one step. So I need to plan a sequence of moves to bring the ""is"" and ""key"" next to ""baba.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule up to where the ""is"" is. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. Moving it up 5 steps would bring it to 4 up, where the ""is"" rule is. Then, placing ""key"" next to it would form ""baba is key.""

But that seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a quicker way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba."" The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. ""Baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down. So, moving the ""key"" rule left 8 steps and down 4 steps would bring it next to ""baba."" But that's a lot of moves.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the initial setup again.

The win is at 9 right and 5 up. There's a door at 5 right and 3 up, and a key at 7 right and 3 up. So, to get to the win, I probably need to go right, pass the door, which requires the key.

So, the path would be: move right, get the key, then go back to the door, open it, and proceed to the win.

But the walls are in the way. Let me see the wall positions:

- 4 right and 5 up
- 4 right and 4 up
- 4 right and 3 up
- 4 right and 2 up
- 4 right and 1 up
- 4 right
- 4 right and 1 down

So, there's a vertical line of walls at 4 right, from 5 up to 1 down. That's a solid wall blocking the way.

So, to get past 4 right, I need to either break the wall or find a way around.

But since the walls are at 4 right, I can't go through them. So, maybe I need to go above or below.

Looking at the map, above 4 right is up to 5 up, which is the win area. Below 4 right is 1 down, which is also blocked.

Wait, maybe I can manipulate the wall rules. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to change its definition. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I move it somewhere else, maybe I can redefine what a wall is.

For example, if I make ""wall is key,"" then the walls would become keys, which I can collect. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I make ""wall is you,"" then I would become a wall, which might not be useful.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""stop is not wall,"" then walls wouldn't stop me. But again, without a ""not"" rule, that's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to redefine it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it next to ""wall,"" making ""wall is stop,"" but that's the default, so it wouldn't change anything.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me look at the ball. It's at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe it's part of a puzzle. If I can move the ball to hit something, perhaps it can trigger a change.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe if I can make the ball push a rule block.

Alternatively, maybe the ball is just a distraction.

Let me think again about the key and door. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So, to get the key, I need to go right past the door, but the door is blocked until I have the key.

Wait, that's a classic puzzle setup. So, I need to find another way to get the key without going through the door.

But the walls are at 4 right, so I can't go past them. Unless I can go above or below.

Looking at the map, above 4 right is up to 5 up, which is where the win is. Below 4 right is 1 down, which is also blocked.

Wait, maybe I can go around the walls by moving up or down.

Let me see: if I move up from my starting position, I can go to 4 up, but there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up. So, I can't go there.

Alternatively, if I move down, I can go to 1 down, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 down.

Hmm, seems like I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to somewhere else, maybe I can redefine it.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it next to ""wall,"" making ""wall is stop,"" but that's the default. So, that won't help.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is you,"" which would make me stop, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is key,"" then the stop rule would become a key, which I can collect. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I should try to move towards the key and see what happens.

So, from my starting position, I can move right to 1 right, then up to 4 up, but that's blocked by a wall. So, I can't go that way.

Alternatively, I can move right to 1 right, then down to 1 down, but that's also blocked.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. From my starting position, moving up would take me to 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. So, I can't go there.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to redefine something. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. If I move it down to where ""baba"" is, making ""baba is something,"" maybe that can help.

For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I can collect the key. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba.""

The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. ""Baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule left 8 steps and down 4 steps to get it next to ""baba."" That's a lot of moves, but maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""key"" is. That would require moving it right 8 steps and up 4 steps. Also a lot.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""baba is key"" in fewer steps. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. If I move it down to 1 down, where ""baba"" is, then I can place ""key"" next to it.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Each move is one step. So, from 4 up, moving down 5 steps would bring it to 1 down. That would take 5 moves.

Once the ""is"" rule is at 1 down, next to ""baba,"" I can move the ""key"" rule next to it, making ""baba is key.""

But moving the ""key"" rule from 7 right and 3 up to 1 right and 1 down would require moving it left 6 steps and down 4 steps. That's 10 moves, which seems too long.

Maybe there's a smarter way. Perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule closer in fewer steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to help. The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. If I can make the ball push a rule block, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer.

But I'm not sure how to do that. The ball's behavior depends on the rules, and I don't see any rules affecting it yet.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push the ball to move rule blocks. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball and use it to move rule blocks. But that would require changing the rule, which might be possible.

So, first, I need to make ""ball is you."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""you.""

The ""ball"" is at 1 right and 4 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up.

So, moving the ""is"" rule down to 4 up - 3 steps = 1 up, then next to ""ball"" at 1 right and 4 up. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule to 1 right and 4 up, next to ""ball,"" making ""ball is something."" Then, moving the ""you"" rule next to it to make ""ball is you.""

But that would require moving the ""you"" rule from 1 right and 1 down to 1 right and 4 up, which is 3 steps up. That's possible.

So, step by step:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 4 up to 1 right and 4 up (next to ""ball"").
2. Move the ""you"" rule from 1 right and 1 down to 1 right and 4 up (next to ""is"").
Now, the rule is ""ball is you,"" meaning I control the ball.

Then, I can move the ball to push other rule blocks. For example, moving the ball to push the ""key"" rule closer.

But I'm not sure if this is the most efficient way. It seems like a lot of steps.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the win is at 9 right and 5 up. To get there, I need to go right past the walls. Since the walls are at 4 right, I need to find a way to pass them.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is not stop"" by redefining the wall rule. But without a ""not"" rule, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to make ""wall is key,"" then the walls would become keys, which I can collect. But that might not help me pass through them.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I would become a wall, which might allow me to move through other walls. But that seems risky.

Alternatively, if I can make ""you is wall,"" then I would turn into a wall, which might not be helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move towards the key and see if I can find a way through.

From my starting position, I can move right to 1 right, then up to 4 up, but that's blocked by a wall. So, I can't go that way.

Alternatively, I can move right to 1 right, then down to 1 down, but that's also blocked.

Wait, maybe I can move up first. From my starting position, moving up would take me to 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. So, I can't go there.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to redefine something. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. If I move it down to where ""baba"" is, making ""baba is something,"" maybe that can help.

For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I can collect the key. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba.""

The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. ""Baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down. So, I need to move the ""key"" rule left 8 steps and down 4 steps to get it next to ""baba."" That's a lot of moves, but maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""key"" is. That would require moving it right 8 steps and up 4 steps. Also a lot.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""baba is key"" in fewer steps. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. If I move it down to 1 down, where ""baba"" is, then I can place ""key"" next to it.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Each move is one step. So, from 4 up, moving down 5 steps would bring it to 1 down. That would take 5 moves.

Once the ""is"" rule is at 1 down, next to ""baba,"" I can move the","

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, and some other items. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible. There's a ball, a door, a key, and various rules scattered around.

The rules present are:
- ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up
- ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up
- ""wall"" at 1 step left and 4 up
- ""is"" at 4 up
- ""door"" at 5 right and 3 up
- ""key"" at 7 right and 3 up
- ""baba"" at 1 left and 1 down
- ""is"" at 1 down
- ""you"" at 1 right and 1 down

Hmm, so the ""win"" rule is pretty far to the right. I need to get there, but there are walls and other rules in the way. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, which might be useful for opening the door at 5 right and 3 up. But to get the key, I might need to move through some areas.

I'm currently at a position where I can move up, right, down, or left. Let me visualize the map. The walls are creating a sort of barrier on the right side, but maybe I can go around them. The ball is at 1 right and 4 up, which might be a movable object. If I can push the ball, maybe I can break through a wall or rearrange some rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. That probably means that any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved. I need to make sure I don't try to move anything that's stopped. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up, so walls are defined as stop, meaning they can't be moved. That's important because I can't push them aside.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down, which is where I am. The ""is"" rule is at 1 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right and 1 down. So, if I move down, I might be able to interact with these rules. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""you.""

But my main goal is to reach the ""win"" object. To do that, I probably need to collect the key to open the door. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So, I need to get to the key first.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I can move right to get closer to the key. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go up first to avoid them. If I move up, I can see if there's a path around the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ball. If I push the ball to the right, maybe it can break through a wall or help me reach the key. But I need to check if the ball can be moved. Since the ball isn't defined as stop, I can probably push it.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right and 4 up. If I move right, I can get next to it. Then, I can push it further right. But I need to make sure there's space for the ball to move without hitting a wall.

Another thought: if I can rearrange the rules, maybe I can change what ""win"" means. For example, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would win the level. That could be a shortcut.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" But the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up, and ""is"" is at 8 right and 5 up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the key is.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key. But that might be complicated.

Let me focus on getting the key first. To reach the key at 7 right and 3 up, I need to move right and up. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can go up first to a higher level where there are fewer walls.

Looking at the map, the walls are mostly on the right side, but there's a path on the left. If I move left, I can go around, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. If I move down, I can pick up the ""baba"" rule and maybe combine it with other rules. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win,"" which would mean that when I reach the win condition, I win.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe I should just try to move towards the key.

Let me try moving right first. If I move right, I can get closer to the key. But there's a wall at 4 right and 5 up. Maybe I can go around it by moving up first.

Alternatively, I can move up to 4 up, where there's a ""is"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""is is win,"" but that might not make sense.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's pretty far. Maybe I can create a shortcut by changing the rules.

Another idea: if I can make ""you is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you,"" making ""key is you,"" which would mean I can control the key. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

I think the simplest approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right to get closer. If I move right, I can get to 1 right, then up to 4 up, and then right again towards the key.

But I need to avoid the walls. Let me check the positions again. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So, moving right beyond 4 might be blocked.

Maybe I can go up first to 5 up, where there's a ""is"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" rule down, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to where I am, making ""win is you,"" which would mean that when I reach the win condition, I win. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 5 up next to ""win,"" making ""is is win,"" but that doesn't seem useful.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ball. If I can push the ball to the right, it might help me reach the key.

The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. If I move right to 1 right, then up to 4 up, I can push the ball further right. But I need to make sure there's space.

Alternatively, I can move down to 1 down, where there's a ""is"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""you,"" I can create a new rule like ""is is you,"" which might change my properties.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should just try moving right and see where that takes me.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. That means any object with ""stop"" can't be moved. I need to be careful not to try moving walls or other stopped objects.

I think I'll try moving right first. Let's see what happens.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Then there are some rules: ""is"" at 7 right and 5 up, ""win"" at 8 right and 5 up, and ""wall"" at 2 left and 4 up. There's also another ""is"" rule at 1 left and 4 up. A ball is at 4 up. Walls are scattered around, and there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 3 up. Doors and keys are present too, with the key at 6 right and 3 up, and a key at 1 left. There's a ""baba"" rule at 2 left and 1 down, an ""is"" rule at 1 left and 1 down, and a ""you"" rule at 1 down. Walls are also at various positions.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The ""stop"" rule might be preventing me from moving through certain walls. I see a key at 1 left, which might be useful for opening a door. The door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 6 right and 3 up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is at 1 left, so I should move left. But wait, there's a wall at 3 right and 1 step up, and other walls around. I need to check if I can move left without hitting a wall. Let me see my current position. If I'm at the starting point, moving left might take me towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to reach the ""is"" or ""win"" rules. If I can rearrange the rules, I might change what counts as a win or make myself able to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but if I can change that, maybe I can move through them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that, I might be able to change how walls behave. But I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" Since the ""stop"" rule is an object, maybe I can move it.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key at 1 left. So I should move left. But is there a wall blocking me? The wall is at 3 right and 1 step up, so if I'm at the starting point, moving left once would take me to 1 left, which is where the key is. So maybe I can just move left once to pick up the key.

But wait, the key is at 1 left, and I'm at the origin. So moving left would take me to the key's position. Let me try that. So the action would be ""left.""

Alternatively, maybe I need to move up first to get past some walls. But I think moving left directly to the key is the way to go. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win condition.

So, I'll choose to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out a path that avoids the walls or uses the rules to change them. The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure yet.

I also see some rule blocks. There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change what a wall is. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me think about the movement. I'm currently at the starting position, which I assume is the origin (0,0). The win is at (9,5), which is quite far. The key is at (7,3), and the door is at (5,3). So, I need to get to the key first, then to the door, and then to the win.

But there are walls blocking the way. For example, there's a wall at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), and (4,0). So, the column at x=4 is completely blocked from y=0 to y=5. That means I can't go straight right past x=4. I need to find another way around.

Looking at the map, maybe I can go up first to avoid the walls. Let me see: if I move up, I can go to (0,1), (0,2), etc. But there are walls at (4,1), (4,2), etc., so if I go up, I might still be blocked when I try to move right.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left, but I don't see any objects to the left except for some rule blocks. Wait, there's a ""wall"" rule at (-1,4). If I can move that, maybe I can change the wall's properties. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another idea: perhaps I can use the ball. The ball is at (1,4). If I can push the ball, maybe it can break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with the environment.

Wait, the ball is at (1,4). If I move right to (1,0), then up to (1,4), I can reach the ball. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But I don't know if that's possible right now.

Let me try to plan a path. I need to get to the key at (7,3). To get there, I have to go around the walls at x=4. Maybe I can go up to y=5, then right past x=4, and then down to y=3. Let's see:

From (0,0), move up to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). Then move right to (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) is a wall, so I can't go further right at y=5. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the wall at (4,5) is a single wall. Maybe I can go around it by moving up further, but I don't see any higher y positions. So, that's not possible.

Another idea: maybe I can go down instead. From (0,0), move down to (0,-1), but I don't see any objects there. That might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ""stop"" rule. There's a ""stop"" rule at (3,3). If I can move that, maybe I can stop the walls from blocking me. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule. The door is at (5,3). If I can move it, maybe I can open it without needing the key. But I don't know how to do that yet.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The other rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" and ""ball."" Maybe I can create a new rule by moving these.

For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win,"" which would let me win immediately. But I need to move the ""is"" rule from (8,5) to next to ""win"" at (9,5). That would require moving the ""is"" rule one step right, but I don't know if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the door to open it. The key is at (7,3), and the door is at (5,3). If I can move the key to (5,3), maybe the door will open. But I need to move the key, which might require breaking the wall.

Wait, the key is at (7,3), and the door is at (5,3). So, if I can get the key, I can open the door. But to get the key, I need to reach (7,3), which is blocked by the wall at x=4.

Hmm, maybe I can break the wall by changing the rules. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls won't block me. But I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall.

The ""stop"" rule is at (3,3). If I can move it next to a wall, like at (4,3), which is a wall, then the rule becomes ""wall is stop,"" meaning walls stop movement. But that's the default behavior, so it might not help.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" so I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then next to ""you."" But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,1). If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win,"" which would let me win by being Baba. But I need to move the ""baba"" rule to (9,5), which is where ""win"" is.

But moving the ""baba"" rule would require pushing it, and I don't know if that's possible. Maybe I can use the ball to push it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is at (1,4). If I can move the ball to (0,4), then maybe I can push it somewhere. But I'm not sure how that helps.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving in a different direction. Let me try moving up first to see if I can find a way around the walls.

From (0,0), I'll move up to (0,1). Then up to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). Now I'm at (0,5). From here, I can move right to (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), but (4,5) is a wall. So I can't go further right at y=5.

Maybe I can move down from (3,5) to (3,4), then right to (4,4), but (4,4) is a wall. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4), then right to (4,4) is a wall, so no.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another path. Let me try moving right first.

From (0,0), move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) is a wall. So I can't go further right at y=0.

Wait, there's a wall at (4,0), so I can't go past x=3 at y=0.

Maybe I can move up from (3,0) to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). At (3,3), there's a ""stop"" rule. If I can move that, maybe I can change something.

But I'm not sure how to use the ""stop"" rule. Maybe if I move it next to a wall, I can make walls stop movement, but that's already the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to Baba to stop myself, but that doesn't seem helpful.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to create a new rule. Let me see: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from (8,5) to (9,5), next to ""win.""

But how can I move the ""is"" rule? I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with. Maybe I can use the ball.

The ball is at (1,4). If I can move the ball to (8,5), then maybe I can push the ""is"" rule to (9,5). But that seems too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,1). If I can move it to (9,5), then ""baba is win"" would be the rule, and I can win.

But moving the ""baba"" rule requires pushing it, and I don't see a way to do that.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1,1). If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""you is win,"" which would let me win by being myself.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""you"" rule. It's at (1,1), so I can move it up or right.

If I move it right to (2,1), then up to (2,2), etc., but I don't see how that helps.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to get the key first.

The key is at (7,3). To get there, I need to go around the wall at x=4. Maybe I can go up to y=5, then right to x=7, but I can't go past x=4 at y=5.

Alternatively, maybe I can go down to y=-1, but I don't see any objects there.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""door"" rule. The door is at (5,3). If I can get the key, I can open it. But to get the key, I need to reach (7,3), which is blocked.

Hmm, maybe I can move the door. If I can move the door to a different position, maybe I can open it without needing the key. But I don't know how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into something else. If I can change the rule, maybe the door becomes passable without the key.

Wait, the door is at (5,3). If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can change its property. For example, if I make ""door is you,"" then I can walk through it.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from (8,5) to (5,3). That's a long way, and I don't see how to do it.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ball. The ball is at (1,4). If I can move it to (4,4), which is a wall, maybe it can break the wall. But I don't know if that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push the ""is"" rule. If I can get the ball next to the ""is"" rule, I can push it somewhere.

But the ""is"" rule is at (8,5), which is far away. I don't see a way to get the ball there.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move left. There's a ""wall"" rule at (-1,4). If I can move it, maybe I can change the walls.

But I'm not sure how to move it. I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" so I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then next to ""you.""

But I don't know how to do that. It seems too complicated.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move up and see if I can find a way around.

From (0,0), move up to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). Then right to (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). Can't go further right because of the wall at (4,5).

Maybe I can move down from (3,5) to (3,4), then right to (4,4) is a wall. So no.

Alternatively, from (3,5), move down to (3,4), then right to (4,4) is a wall. No.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at (9,5). If I can move it closer, I can reach it easier.

But I don't know how to move it. I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""win."" But I don't know how to move the ""is"" rule.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""key"" rule. The key is at (7,3). If I can move it next to the door at (5,3), maybe the door will open.

But I don't know how to move the key. I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""door"" rule. If I can move it to a different position, maybe I can open it without the key.

But I don't know how to move it. I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (3,3). If I can move it next to a wall, maybe I can stop the walls from blocking me.

But I don't know how to move it. I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""ball"" rule. The ball is at (1,4). If I can move it somewhere useful, maybe it can help.

But I don't know how to use the ball. Maybe I can push it to break walls, but I don't see how.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1,1). If I can move it next to ""win,"" I can make ""you is win,"" which would let me win by being myself.

But I don't know how to move it. I need to push it, but I don't see any objects to push it with.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There's also a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. There's another wall at 1 step left and 4 up, which might be blocking something.

There's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Balls can be pushed, so maybe that's useful. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up, which probably means that object can't be moved. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 up, and the key is at 7 steps right and 3 up. So to open the door, I need the key.

I'm currently at some position, and I need to figure out how to get to the key and then to the door, and eventually to the win. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ball to break through a wall or something.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step down, and ""you"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe rearranging these can change what Baba is.

I think I need to move towards the key first. Let me try moving right to get closer to the key and door. If I move right, I can get closer to the door and key, which are both to the right. Once I have the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win.

So, I'll choose to move right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, and some other things. The ""WIN"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also see a ""key"" at 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door. There's a ""door"" at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so I might need the key to get through that.

I notice that there are several ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules or change existing ones. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""WIN,"" I might be able to change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary yet.

Right now, I'm at the starting position. The walls are blocking some paths, but I can move around them. The ball is at 4 steps up, which might be a distraction or part of a puzzle. I should probably avoid it unless it's necessary.

I think the key is important because it's close to me. If I pick up the key, I can use it to open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition. So, my first move should be to go left to get the key. That way, I can progress further into the level.

Wait, but I'm supposed to output an action. The possible actions are idle, up, right, down, left. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left to pick it up. That makes sense because having the key will help me unlock the door later on.

So, the best course of action is to move left to get the key. That way, I can proceed towards the door and eventually reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""door"" 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. That might block my path. I also see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. There are several walls around, which I can't pass through unless I change the rules.

I notice there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could change the win condition. Or perhaps I can make Baba able to move through walls by changing the rules.

Let me think about the positions. I'm currently at the starting point, which is probably where Baba is. The walls are mostly to the right and up, so maybe I need to move up first to get past some walls.

If I move up, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule at 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" to combine with another word to make a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba is win,"" then Baba becomes the win condition, and I can just reach myself.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that helps. Or maybe ""stop is nothing,"" which would remove the stop effect.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop,"" I could change it. For example, ""stop is you"" would make the stop block me, which isn't helpful. Maybe ""stop is nothing"" would remove the stop effect, allowing me to pass through.

But how do I get to the ""stop"" rule? It's 3 steps up, so I need to move up three times. Let me plan that.

First, I'll move up to get closer. Then, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" to change the rule. Once the stop effect is removed, I can move freely past the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to reach myself, which might be easier.

Let me try moving up to get to the ""is"" rule at 4 steps up. Once there, I can move it next to ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" That way, I just need to reach myself, which is already done, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, no, because ""baba is you"" is the current rule, so I control Baba. If I make ""baba is win,"" then Baba becomes the win condition, so I just need to be where I am, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to make ""you is win"" so that when I reach the win object, it triggers.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" to make ""win is you,"" which would mean that the win object is me, so I just need to be myself, which is already true. That doesn't help.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key to open the door. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and reach the win.

But to get to the key, I need to move right 7 steps and up 3 steps. There are walls in the way, so I might need to change the rules to pass through walls.

If I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls won't block me. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""nothing."" But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and making ""stop is nothing.""

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop,"" I can make ""stop is nothing,"" which would remove the stop effect. Then, I can move through the stop blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""stop"" to make ""wall is stop,"" but that would make walls block me, which isn't helpful.

Wait, no, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would have the stop property, meaning I can't move through them, which is the default. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is wall,"" then the stop blocks become walls, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is key."" If I can do that, then I can open the door without needing the key object. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and then next to ""key.""

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can make ""you is key,"" which would allow me to open the door.

But how do I get to the ""you"" rule? It's 1 step right and 1 step down from my current position. So, I can move right once and down once to get there.

Once I'm there, I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" to make ""you is key."" Then, I can approach the door, and since I'm ""key,"" I can open it.

That seems promising. Let me plan that.

First, move right once to get closer to the ""you"" rule. Then, move down once to reach it. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" to create ""you is key.""

Once that's done, I can move towards the door, and since I'm now a key, I can open it and reach the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""key is you,"" which would mean the key is me, so I can pick it up by being on it. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I make ""you is key,"" then I become the key, so I can open the door by being next to it. That might work.

So, the steps are:

1. Move right once to get to the position next to the ""you"" rule.
2. Move down once to reach the ""you"" rule.
3. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" to create ""you is key.""
4. Then, move towards the door, and since I'm a key, I can open it.

But I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 4 steps up. So, I need to move up 4 times to get it, then move it next to ""you.""

Wait, that might take too many steps. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" which would mean that the win object is me, so I just need to be where I am. But that doesn't make sense because I'm already me.

Wait, no, ""baba is you"" means I control Baba. If I make ""win is you,"" then the win condition is me, so I just need to be myself, which is already true. So, that would immediately win the level.

But is that possible? Let me check.

The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is you.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 5 up to 9 right, 5 up, which is next to ""win."" Then, the rule becomes ""win is you,"" meaning the win condition is me, so I win immediately.

That seems like a quick solution. So, the steps are:

1. Move right 8 times and up 5 times to get to the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right once more to get next to ""win.""
3. Now, the rule ""win is you"" is active, so I win.

But wait, moving 8 steps right and 5 up is a lot. I'm not sure if I can do that without hitting walls.

Looking back at the map, there are walls at 4 right and various up steps. So, moving 8 right might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get past the walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 5 up, 4 right and 4 up, etc. So, if I move up 5 times, I can get above the walls and then move right.

Let me try that.

1. Move up 5 times to get to the top.
2. Then, move right 8 times to reach the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right once more to make ""win is you.""
4. Then, I win.

But I'm not sure if moving up 5 is possible without hitting walls. Let me check the walls.

The walls are at 4 right and 5 up, so if I'm at 0 right and 0 up, moving up 5 would take me to 0 right, 5 up, which is a wall. So, I can't move up 5 from the start.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right 4 times to get past the walls, then move up.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and various up steps. So, if I move right 4 times, I'm at the wall, which I can't pass unless I change the rules.

So, perhaps I need to change the rules to pass through walls first.

If I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""nothing."" But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can create ""nothing"" by moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and making ""stop is nothing."" Then, I can use ""nothing"" to make ""wall is nothing.""

So, the steps would be:

1. Move up 3 times to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" to make ""stop is nothing.""
3. Now, ""stop"" has no effect, so I can move through stop blocks.
4. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""nothing"" to make ""wall is nothing.""
5. Now, walls don't block me, so I can move freely.
6. Then, I can move to the ""win"" rule and make ""win is you"" to win.

But this seems complicated and time-consuming. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win."" If I can do that, then I just need to be myself, which I already am, so I win.

To make ""you is win,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and then next to ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right and 5 up. That's a long way. Maybe it's not feasible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move ""win"" next to ""is,"" I can make ""win is you.""

But moving ""win"" would require moving it from 9 right, 5 up to next to ""is"" at 8 right, 5 up. So, moving ""win"" left once would make it 8 right, 5 up, next to ""is."" Then, the rule becomes ""win is you,"" and I win.

But can I move ""win""? The ""win"" rule is an object, so I can move it if it's not stopped. I need to check if it's movable.

Looking at the active rules, only ""baba is you"" is active. So, ""win"" is just an object, and I can move it.

So, the steps are:

1. Move right 8 times and up 5 times to get to the ""is"" rule.
2. Move the ""win"" rule left once to make it 8 right, 5 up, next to ""is.""
3. Now, the rule ""win is you"" is active, so I win.

But again, moving 8 right and 5 up is blocked by walls. So, I need to find a way to get there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where I am.

The ""is"" rule is 8 right, 5 up. If I can move it down to my position, I can create a new rule.

But moving the ""is"" rule requires moving it step by step. I'm not sure if that's possible without hitting walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down by moving it step by step. Let me see.

If I can move the ""is"" rule down from 8 right, 5 up to 8 right, 4 up, then to 8 right, 3 up, etc., until it's next to me.

But that would take a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if I can do that without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can make ""baba is win,"" which would mean that Baba is the win condition. So, I just need to be Baba, which I already am, so I win.

But how do I get the ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" rule?

The ""is"" rule is 8 right, 5 up. The ""baba"" rule is 1 left, 1 down. That's a long distance. Maybe it's not feasible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and then next to ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is 1 right, 1 down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right, 5 up. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 5 up to 1 right, 1 down, then to 9 right, 5 up. That seems too complicated.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

I see a ""ball"" 1 step right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can help. If I can make the ball do something, like push a rule into place.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe if I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can push the ball to move rules. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so I can control the ball and use it to move rules.

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and then next to ""you.""

The ""ball"" is 1 right, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is 8 right, 5 up. So, moving the ""is"" rule to 1 right, 4 up would require moving it left 7 and down 1, which is a lot.

I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Wait, maybe I can make ""stop is nothing"" to remove the stop effect, then move freely.

The ""stop"" rule is 3 up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop,"" I can make ""stop is nothing.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 5 up to 3 up. That's a lot of steps, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to ""is.""

The ""stop"" rule is 3 up. The ""is"" rule is 8 right, 5 up. So, moving the ""stop"" rule right 8 and up 2 would place it next to ""is,"" making ""stop is is,"" which doesn't help.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.

Wait, I see that the ""key"" is 7 right, 3 up, and the ""door"" is 5 right, 3 up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and reach the win.

But to get the key, I need to move right 7 and up 3. There are walls in the way, so I might need to change the rules to pass through walls.

If I can make ""wall is nothing,"" I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""nothing.""

But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and making ""stop is nothing.""

So, the steps would be:

1. Move up 3 times to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" to make ""stop is nothing.""
3. Now, ""stop"" has no effect, so I can move through stop blocks.
4. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""nothing"" to make ""wall is nothing.""
5. Now, walls don't block me, so I can move freely.
6. Then, move right 7 and up 3 to get the key.
7. Move right 2 more to reach the door, which I can now open.
8. Finally, move to the win.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a quicker way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is key"" so I can open the door without needing the key object.

To do that, I need to move the","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There's also a rule ""is"" 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. So the win condition is pretty far to the right and up.

There's a ball 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe that's something I can interact with. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up, which might be blocking something. Doors and keys are present too, which suggests I might need to unlock a door to proceed.

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move these rules to change what Baba is or what counts as winning.

Since I'm currently at the starting position, I think moving up would be a good idea to get closer to the win condition. Let me try moving up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps right and 4 up. Then there are some rules: ""is"" at 8 right, 4 up; ""win"" at 9 right, 4 up. There's also a ""wall"" rule 1 left, 3 up. Another ""is"" rule at 3 up. A ball is at 1 right, 3 up. More walls at 4 right, 3 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; and 4 right. A key is 1 step down. Walls are also at 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down. Then there are rules: ""baba"" 1 left, 2 down; ""is"" 2 down; ""you"" 1 right, 2 down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to move. The key is 1 step down, which might be important. The door is at 5 right, 2 up, and the key is at 7 right, 2 up. So maybe I need the key to open the door. But how do I get the key?

I'm currently at some position, and I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Let me visualize the map. The walls are creating a sort of barrier, but there's a path somewhere. The key is down, so maybe I should move down to get it.

Wait, but the key is 1 step down from where I am. So if I move down, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which is at 5 right, 2 up. So I need to get to the door, which is to the right and up a bit.

But first, I need to get the key. So moving down seems like a good idea. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a door, a key, and some other things. The ""WIN"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. To get there, I need to figure out how to move through the map without getting blocked by walls or other obstacles.

I notice there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change how movement works. Also, there's a ""door"" at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, and a ""key"" at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. So, I might need to get the key to open the door, but I'm not sure yet.

The ball is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break something or change a rule. There's also a ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down, and a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move these, I might be able to change who I am or what I can do.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make movement easier. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. Or perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. Let me see how I can do that.

If I move the ""is"" rule next to a wall, I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" or something else. But I need to be careful because changing rules can have unexpected effects. I also need to make sure I don't get stuck by moving rules in a way that blocks my path.

Another idea is to use the key and door. If I can get the key, maybe I can open the door to reach the win condition. But I need to figure out how to get to the key first. It's at 7 steps right and 3 steps up, which is behind some walls. Maybe I can move some walls or change their properties to get through.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule and a ""you"" rule. If I can combine them differently, maybe I can change my own properties. For example, if I make ""you is win,"" then reaching myself would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible here.

Let me try to plan my moves. I'll start by moving towards the key. I need to go right and up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. If I can do that, I can move through the wall to reach the key.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop me. But I already have ""stop"" as a rule, so maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""you"" to change the active rule. If I make ""baba is win,"" then reaching Baba would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

I think the best course of action is to move towards the key first. I'll go right to get past the initial walls. Let me try moving right a few times to see if I can reach the key.

After moving right, I encounter a wall. I need to find a way to move through it. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall to make it passable. If I can do that, I can move through the wall and continue towards the key.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to the wall to create a new rule. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" I can push the wall out of the way. But I'm not sure if ""push"" is a valid property in this context.

Another idea is to use the ball. If I can move the ball into a wall, maybe it will break the wall. But I need to figure out how to control the ball's movement.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""baba"" rule to change my own properties. If I make ""baba is jump,"" I can jump over walls. But I don't see a ""jump"" rule on the map.

Wait, I see a ""door"" and a ""key."" Maybe I can use the key to open the door. If I can get the key, I can move through the door to reach the win condition. Let me try to move towards the key.

I need to go right and up to reach the key. But there are walls blocking my path. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. If I can do that, I can move through the wall and continue towards the key.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall to create a new rule. For example, if I make ""wall is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But I'm not sure if ""pass"" is a valid property.

I think the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it passable. Let me try that. I'll move up to the ""stop"" rule and then move it to a wall.

After moving the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can now pass through that wall. I'll move through the wall and continue towards the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door and reach the win condition.

Wait, I just realized that moving the ""stop"" rule might affect other parts of the map. I need to make sure I don't create any new problems by doing this. But I think it's worth a try.

So, my plan is to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, pass through it, get the key, open the door, and reach the win condition. Let's see if that works.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps right and 5 up. Then there's a rule ""is"" at 7 right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 8 right and 5 up. So the win condition is pretty far to the right and up. There's also a rule ""wall"" at 2 left and 4 up, which might mean that walls are defined there. Another ""is"" rule at 1 left and 4 up, a ball at 4 up, and walls at 3 right and 4 up.

Further down, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 3 up, which probably means something can't move through it. Then a wall at 3 right and 3 up, a ""door"" rule at 4 right and 3 up, and a ""key"" rule at 6 right and 3 up. So there's a door and a key involved, which suggests I might need the key to open the door.

There's a wall at 3 right and 2 up, another at 3 right and 1 up, a key at 1 left, a wall at 3 right, and some rules below: ""baba"" at 2 left and 1 down, ""is"" at 1 left and 1 down, ""you"" at 1 down, and a wall at 3 right and 1 down.

So, I'm Baba, and I need to get to the win condition. The key is at 1 left, which is to the left of my current position. The door is at 4 right and 3 up, so I might need the key to pass through it. The walls are in the way, but maybe I can move some rules to change the environment.

I think I should first move towards the key. Since the key is at 1 left, I need to go left. But I'm currently at some position; let me figure out where. The initial position isn't given, but based on the objects, I'm probably near the bottom. So moving left would take me towards the key.

Wait, but if I move left, I might hit a wall. Let me check the walls. There's a wall at 3 right and 1 down, which is below me. So maybe I can move left without hitting a wall immediately. Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move up to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that, I might be able to change the rules to make something else ""you"" or ""win.""

But I'm not sure. Let me think step by step. My goal is to reach the win, which is at 8 right and 5 up. That's pretty high and far. To get there, I might need to go through the door, which requires the key.

So, first, I need to get the key. The key is at 1 left, so I should move left. But I need to make sure there's a path. Let me see: moving left from my current position, are there any walls? The wall is at 3 right and 1 down, which is to the right and below me, so moving left should be clear.

So, I'll move left. That should take me closer to the key. Once I have the key, I can then approach the door at 4 right and 3 up. But to get there, I might need to move up as well.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to reach the ""is"" rule and change some rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that, I might be able to create a stop somewhere else. But I'm not sure.

I think the most straightforward path is to get the key first. So, I'll move left to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it, then proceed towards the win.

So, my first action should be to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps right and 5 up. Then there are several rules: ""is"" at 8 right, 5 up; ""win"" at 9 right, 5 up; ""wall"" at 1 left, 4 up; another ""is"" at 4 up; a ball at 1 right, 4 up; more walls at various positions; a ""stop"" rule at 3 up; a ""door"" at 5 right, 3 up; a ""key"" at 7 right, 3 up; and some more walls and rules down below.

I need to figure out how to move. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The ""stop"" rule might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule or other rules to change the environment.

I see a key at 7 right, 3 up. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door. The door is at 5 right, 3 up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed further.

But to get the key, I might need to move through some walls or change the rules. Let me see where the rules are. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up, and another ""is"" at 4 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. Maybe I can move these rules to create new ones.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move that, I might be able to turn walls into something else. Or maybe move the ""stop"" rule to a different position to allow movement.

I also see a ball at 1 right, 4 up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the key, which is at 7 right, 3 up. To get there, I might need to move right several times. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break a wall by changing its rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule so that it's not blocking my path. If I can move the ""stop"" rule down or somewhere else, I might be able to pass through what was previously a stopping point.

Another idea: if I can make myself into a key or a door, I can bypass the need for the physical key. But that might be more complicated.

Let me try to move right first. I'm currently at the starting position. Moving right once would take me to 1 right, but there's a wall there. Hmm, maybe I can move up first to avoid the wall.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change the properties of walls. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule next to a wall, I can redefine it. Maybe I can make a wall into a ""you"" or something else.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it down or to the side, I can prevent it from stopping me.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right a few times to get closer. But I have to be careful not to hit any walls or stop rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move up three times, I might hit it. Maybe I should move right first to avoid that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule by pushing it with another object. But I'm not sure how that works yet.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving right a few times and see what happens. Let's try moving right once. If that's blocked, I'll have to find another way.

But I can't move right because there's a wall. Maybe I need to change the wall into something else. How can I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to a wall to redefine it.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move it to a wall's position, I can change that wall's properties. For example, making it a ""you"" so I can walk through it.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I can only move text blocks, not walls, unless I change the rules. Wait, the ""wall"" rule is a text block, so I can move it.

Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule to a wall's position. For example, moving it to 4 right, 4 up where there's a wall. That might change that wall into something else.

But to move the ""wall"" rule, I need to be next to it. It's at 1 left, 4 up. So I need to move left once and up four times. But moving left from my starting position might not be possible if there's a wall.

Wait, I'm at the starting position. Let me check the objects again. There's a wall 4 steps right and 5 up, but I'm at the origin. So moving left once would take me to -1 right, which might be off the map. Maybe I can't move left.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for the key again. It's at 7 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right seven times and up three times, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a path by redefining walls. If I can make some walls into ""stop"" or something else, I can pass through.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move that rule to a wall's position, I can make that wall a stop, which might prevent me from moving through it. But I want to do the opposite.

Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away so that walls don't stop me. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, the walls might no longer stop me.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule down or to the side.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule to a different location so that I can win without going through the door and key. But that might not be necessary.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can access the rules above.

Moving up once: is that possible? Let me check. There's a wall 4 right, 5 up, but I'm at the origin. So moving up once would take me to 0 right, 1 up. Is there a wall there? No, according to the objects list, the walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So moving up once is safe.

Let me try moving up once. Now I'm at 0 right, 1 up. From here, I can move up again to 0 right, 2 up. Still no walls. Up again to 0 right, 3 up. Now, is there a wall here? The wall is at 4 right, 3 up, so I'm safe. Up again to 0 right, 4 up. Now, there's a rule ""is"" at 4 up. So I'm at 0 right, 4 up, next to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 4 up, which is where I am now. So I can move the ""is"" rule. Maybe I can move it to redefine something.

If I move the ""is"" rule to the right, I can create a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""win"" or ""wall"" to change their properties.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to a wall's position to redefine it.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to the right. Let's say I move right once from 0 right, 4 up. That would take me to 1 right, 4 up, where there's a ball. Can I move the ball? Or is it a wall?

Wait, the ball is at 1 right, 4 up. So moving right from 0 right, 4 up would take me to the ball. Can I move the ball? I think I can move objects if they're not stopped by rules.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule first.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule. It's at 1 left, 4 up. So from my current position at 0 right, 4 up, I can move left once to reach the ""wall"" rule.

Let me try that. Moving left once from 0 right, 4 up takes me to -1 right, 4 up, where the ""wall"" rule is. Now, I can move the ""wall"" rule. Maybe I can move it down to a wall's position to redefine it.

For example, moving the ""wall"" rule down to 4 right, 4 up, where there's a wall. That would change that wall into something else, perhaps allowing me to pass.

But I'm not sure. Let me try moving the ""wall"" rule down once. Now, the ""wall"" rule is at -1 right, 3 up. That doesn't help much. Maybe I need to move it further.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right. Let's say I move it to 0 right, 4 up, where I was before. That would make the rule ""wall is you"" or something, but I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for the key again. It's at 7 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right seven times and up three times, but there are walls blocking the way.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can move the ball to the key's position, maybe it can help me get the key.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can push the ball through the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move it, I can create a new key somewhere else.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move it, I can open it without needing the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can redefine the door as something else.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it away, I can pass through what was previously a stopping point.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. It's at 3 up. From my current position at 0 right, 4 up, I can move down once to 0 right, 3 up, where the ""stop"" rule is. Now, I can move the ""stop"" rule.

Maybe I can move it to the right, so it's no longer blocking my path. Let's say I move it to 1 right, 3 up. Now, the ""stop"" rule is next to the ball. That might change the ball's properties.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule down to 0 right, 2 up, so it's out of the way.

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should try to move right as much as possible and see what happens.

From my starting position, I can move right once, but there's a wall. So I can't move right. Maybe I need to change that wall.

Wait, the wall is at 4 right, 5 up. I'm at 0 right, 4 up. So I can't reach it directly. Maybe I need to move up first.

Let me try moving up once to 0 right, 1 up. Then up again to 0 right, 2 up. Up again to 0 right, 3 up. Now, I'm at 0 right, 3 up, where the ""stop"" rule is. I can move the ""stop"" rule to the right, say to 1 right, 3 up, which is where the ball is. That might change the ball into a stop, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule down to 0 right, 2 up. That way, it's not blocking my path upwards.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule to a wall's position to make it stop, but I want to do the opposite.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule to a closer position so I can win without going through the door and key.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. If I can move it to a closer position, like 0 right, 0 up, I can win immediately. But how?

I need to move the ""win"" rule. It's at 9 right, 5 up. To reach it, I need to move right nine times and up five times, which is impossible because of the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes me win without needing to reach the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you."" If I can change that rule, I can become something else. But I don't want to do that because I need to control Baba.

Hmm, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to a wall to make the wall the win condition. But that might not help.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""win"" to make ""win is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to 9 right, 5 up, where the ""win"" rule is. That would make ""win is is,"" which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule to a wall's position to redefine it.

Wait, the wall is at 4 right, 5 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can make ""wall is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to walk through walls.

That sounds promising. Let me try that. I need to move the ""is"" rule to the wall's position at 4 right, 5 up.

But to do that, I need to be next to the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. So I need to move right eight times and up five times, which is impossible because of the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 4 up to the wall's position. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up, which is where I was earlier.

Wait, from my position at 0 right, 4 up, I can move right to reach the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 5 up. But that's too far.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look for the key again. It's at 7 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right seven times and up three times, but there are walls blocking the way.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can move the ball to the key's position, maybe it can help me get the key.

But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can push the ball through the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move it, I can create a new key somewhere else.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move it, I can open it without needing the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can redefine the door as something else.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it away, I can pass through what was previously a stopping point.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. It's at 3 up. From my current position at 0 right, 4 up, I can move down once to 0 right, 3 up, where the ""stop"" rule is. Now, I can move the ""stop"" rule.

Maybe I can move it to the right, so it's no longer blocking my path. Let's say I move it to 1 right, 3 up, which is where the ball is. That might change the ball into a stop, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule down to 0 right, 2 up, so it's out of the way.

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should try to move right as much as possible and see what happens.

From my starting position, I can move right once, but there's a wall. So I can't move right. Maybe I need to change that wall.

Wait, the wall is at 4 right, 5 up. I'm at 0 right, 4 up. So I can't reach it directly. Maybe I need to move up first.

Let me try moving up once to 0 right, 1 up. Then up again to 0 right, 2 up. Up again to 0 right, 3 up. Now, I'm at 0 right, 3 up, where the ""stop"" rule is. I can move the ""stop"" rule to the right, say to 1 right, 3 up, which is where the ball is. That might change the ball's properties.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule down to 0 right, 2 up. That way, it's not blocking my path upwards.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule to a wall's position to make it stop, but I want to do the opposite.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There's also a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. There's another ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 4 up, which might be useful for creating new walls or modifying existing ones.

There's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break them. Then there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up, which probably makes objects stop moving. Doors and keys are also present, which suggests that I might need to unlock something.

The key is at 7 steps right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 steps right and 3 up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door. But how do I get there? There are walls blocking the way, so I might need to break them or move them.

Looking at the rules, I can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make the wall stop moving or something. Or maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to change the win condition.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move these, I might be able to change what Baba is. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then Baba would become a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the separate key.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can reach it without having to go all the way to the far right. But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to get near it, but it's 9 steps right and 5 up, which is quite a distance.

Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is at 7 right and 3 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls in the way. Perhaps I can break through them by using the ball or by changing the rules.

If I move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can create a new rule like ""ball is break,"" which would allow the ball to break walls. Then I could use the ball to clear a path to the key.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it stop moving, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is push,"" then I can push objects, including walls, to clear a path. But I don't see a ""push"" rule mentioned, so maybe that's not possible.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it next to a wall, maybe I can make that wall stop moving, but I'm not sure how that helps me progress.

Let me think about the key and door. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition. So maybe I should prioritize getting the key.

To get to the key at 7 right and 3 up, I need to move right and up. But there are walls blocking my path. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to a wall to make it something else, like ""wall is break,"" so I can break through.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to make Baba into something else, like a key or a breaker.

Wait, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I can open the door without needing the separate key. That might be a quicker way to proceed.

So, how do I do that? I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba is"" to form ""baba is key."" But the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up, and ""baba"" is at 1 left and 1 down. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer.

Alternatively, I can move the ""baba"" rule to where the ""key"" rule is, but that might be complicated.

Another approach: use the ball to break walls. If I can make the ball break walls, I can clear a path. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to ""break"" to make ""ball is break.""

But I don't see a ""break"" rule mentioned, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe ""ball is push"" would allow me to push walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can make ""ball is stop,"" then the ball would stop moving, but that doesn't help me.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move towards the key. I need to go right and up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move around them.

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 4 right and 5 up, which is in the way. But if I can move the ""wall"" rule to make that wall into something else, like ""wall is break,"" then I can break through.

So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the wall and then next to ""break."" But again, I don't see a ""break"" rule. Maybe I can use the ball to break it if I make the ball a breaker.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall to make it stop moving, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it next to a wall, maybe I can make that wall stop moving, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe I can move it closer.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to where I am. But it's 9 right and 5 up, which is too far. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""is"" next to ""win"" and then next to something else.

Alternatively, I can try to reach the ""win"" rule by moving right and up, but the walls are blocking me.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to help me move. If I can make the ball push me, then I can ride it to the key.

So, I need to make ""ball is push."" But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" next to ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule either.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck. Let me try to move towards the key step by step. I'll move right to get closer.

So, I'll choose the ""right"" action to move towards the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball, a key, a door, and various walls. The walls are all around, so I need to figure out how to move through them. The rules are a bit scattered, so maybe I can rearrange them to change the game's mechanics.

I see a key and a door. The key is one step to the left, and the door is four steps to the right and three steps up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to open the door. But how do I get to the key? There are walls in the way.

Wait, the ball is four steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how. Let me think about the rules. There's a ""stop"" rule, which probably makes something immovable. If I can move that, maybe I can change what's stoppable.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can combine them to create new rules. For example, if I can get ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But how?

Let me try to visualize the map. The walls are at various positions, but the key is to the left, and the door is to the right. I'm currently at a position where I can move left or right. If I move left, I can get the key, but there's a wall blocking me. Maybe I can move a rule to change the wall's properties.

Alternatively, if I move right, I might be able to reach the door, but it's locked. The key is to the left, so I need to get it first. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move a ""stop"" rule to make a wall passable.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is one step to the left and three steps up. If I can move that, perhaps I can make a wall not stop me. Or maybe I can make the key stoppable or not.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I need to get the key. To do that, I need to move left. But there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move a rule to change the wall's property.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""wall"" rule two steps to the left and four steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is four steps up. If I can move the ball to hit a wall, maybe it will break it. But I'm not sure how the ball moves. Does it move on its own, or do I need to push it?

I think the ball moves when you push it. So if I can get next to the ball, I can push it into the wall. But to get to the ball, I need to move up four steps. Let me see if that's possible.

From my current position, moving up four steps would take me to the ball. But are there walls blocking me? The walls are at various positions, but I think I can move up if there's no wall in the way. Let me check the map again.

The walls are at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up, etc. So moving up four steps from my current position might be possible. Let me try moving up.

If I move up, I can reach the ball. Then, I can push the ball into the wall to break it. Once the wall is broken, I can move left to get the key. With the key, I can open the door and reach the win condition.

Wait, but how do I push the ball? Do I need to have the ""push"" rule active? I don't see a ""push"" rule, so maybe I can create one by rearranging the existing rules.

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used as a tool to break walls without needing the push rule. I'm not sure, but it's worth a try.

So, my plan is: move up to get to the ball, push the ball into the wall to break it, then move left to get the key, and use the key to open the door to reach the win.

But first, I need to move up. Let me try moving up step by step.

First, I'll move up once. Then, I'll check if I can move up again. If there's a wall, I might need to adjust my path.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, so moving up from my current position (which is at 3 steps right and 4 up) would take me to 3 right and 5 up, which is a wall. So I can't move up directly.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I need to move right or left first to find a path around the wall.

If I move right, I might find a way around. Let me see. Moving right from my current position would take me to 4 steps right and 4 up, which is another wall. So that's blocked too.

What about moving left? Moving left from my current position (3 right, 4 up) would take me to 2 right, 4 up. Is there a wall there? Let me check the map.

Yes, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 step up, but moving left from 3 right would be 2 right, which might be clear. Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 4 up, so moving left to 2 right, 4 up might be possible.

So, I can move left once to 2 right, 4 up. Then, I can move up to 2 right, 5 up. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 3 right and 5 up, so 2 right, 5 up might be clear.

From there, I can move right to 3 right, 5 up, but that's a wall. So maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, from 2 right, 5 up, I can move right to 3 right, 5 up (wall), which is blocked. So maybe I need to find another path.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the rules again.

There's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make a wall stoppable or not. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can pass through them.

But I don't see a ""not"" rule, so maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to combine with another rule, I might create a new property.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to be next to a wall, maybe I can make that specific wall stoppable. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to be next to the key, making the key stoppable, but that doesn't seem useful.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and one step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is.

For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But how do I move the ""baba"" rule?

I need to move the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""win."" Let me see where the ""is"" and ""win"" rules are.

The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps to the right and 5 step up, and the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. That's quite far.

I don't think I can reach the ""baba"" rule in time. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can use the key to open the door without needing to break the wall. If I can move the key to the door, maybe it will unlock.

The key is one step to the left, and the door is four steps to the right and three steps up. So, I need to get the key and bring it to the door.

But the walls are blocking my path. Maybe I can move the walls by rearranging the rules.

Wait, there's a ""wall"" rule at 2 steps to the left and 4 step up. If I can move that rule, I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is nothing,"" the walls would disappear, but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to use the ball to break the wall. Let me try to get to the ball.

The ball is four steps up. From my current position, moving up four steps would take me to the ball, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move around the wall.

Wait, if I move left once, I can go to 2 right, 4 up. Then, moving up from there might be possible. Let me try that.

So, first, I'll move left once. Now I'm at 2 right, 4 up. From here, I can move up to 2 right, 5 up. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 3 right and 5 up, so 2 right, 5 up should be clear.

Now, I'm at 2 right, 5 up. From here, I can move right to 3 right, 5 up, but that's a wall. So I can't go that way. Maybe I can move left again to 1 right, 5 up, and then up further? But I don't see any walls mentioned at 1 right, 5 up.

Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 5 up, so 1 right, 5 up is clear. So, I can move left again to 1 right, 5 up. Then, I can move up to 1 right, 6 up, but that's beyond the map. So, maybe I can move right from 1 right, 5 up to 2 right, 5 up, and then up again.

But I'm not making progress towards the ball. Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule. There's an ""is"" rule at 1 step to the left and 4 step up. If I can move that, I can create a new rule.

For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win."" But I'm not sure how to move the ""is"" rule.

Wait, I control Baba, so I can move around and pick up rules. If I can move to the position of the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up and move it elsewhere.

So, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 step up. From my current position at 3 right, 4 up, moving left once would take me to 2 right, 4 up. Then, moving left again to 1 right, 4 up, which is where the ""is"" rule is.

So, I can move left twice to pick up the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it next to ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

But how do I carry the ""is"" rule? I think in Baba Is You, you can pick up rules by moving onto them, and then place them elsewhere.

So, let's try that. I'll move left twice to pick up the ""is"" rule. Now, I'm carrying ""is."" Then, I need to move to where ""win"" is.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 step up. That's quite far. From my current position at 1 right, 4 up, I need to move right 7 steps and up 1 step.

But there are walls in the way. Let me see if I can find a path.

Moving right from 1 right, 4 up to 2 right, 4 up is possible. Then, right to 3 right, 4 up is a wall. So, I can't go that way.

Maybe I can move up first. From 1 right, 4 up, moving up to 1 right, 5 up. Then, moving right to 2 right, 5 up, which is a wall. So, that's blocked.

Alternatively, from 1 right, 4 up, move right to 2 right, 4 up, then up to 2 right, 5 up. Then, right to 3 right, 5 up is a wall. So, that's blocked too.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to find another way to create a new rule.

Wait, there's another ""is"" rule at 7 steps to the right and 5 step up. If I can move that, I can create a new rule there.

But I'm too far from it. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule I picked up to a better position.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""baba"" with ""win."" If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba.

But to do that, I need to place the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down, and ""win"" is at 8 right, 5 up. That's a long distance.

Maybe I can place the ""is"" rule somewhere else to create a different rule that helps me move through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, ""wall is pass"" or ""wall is move.""

But I don't see those rules either. Hmm.

Maybe I can use the key and door to progress. The key is one step to the left, and the door is four steps to the right and three steps up. If I can get the key, I can open the door.

But to get the key, I need to move left, which is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the walls by rearranging the rules.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that, I can make walls stoppable or not.

If I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, which is the default. But if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can pass through them. But I don't see a ""not"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to be next to a wall, maybe I can make that specific wall stoppable. But I'm not sure how that helps.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me look at the ball again.

The ball is four steps up. If I can get to the ball, maybe I can use it to break through walls. But I can't reach it because of the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ball by pushing it. If I can get next to the ball, I can push it into the wall, breaking it.

But to get to the ball, I need to move up four steps, which is blocked by walls. So, I need to find a way around.

Let me try moving left first. From my current position at 3 right, 4 up, moving left once to 2 right, 4 up. Then, moving left again to 1 right, 4 up. From there, I can move up to 1 right, 5 up. Then, moving right to 2 right, 5 up, which is a wall. So, that's blocked.

Alternatively, from 1 right, 4 up, I can move up to 1 right, 5 up, then right to 2 right, 5 up (wall), which is blocked. So, no progress.

Maybe I can move down instead. From 3 right, 4 up, moving down once to 3 right, 3 up. Then, moving left to 2 right, 3 up. From there, moving up to 2 right, 4 up, then up to 2 right, 5 up. Then, right to 3 right, 5 up (wall). Still blocked.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to look for another rule to manipulate.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can open it without the key. But I don't see a way to do that.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through without the key. But I don't see an ""open"" rule.

Hmm. Maybe I need to focus on the key. The key is one step to the left. If I can move the walls to create a path, I can reach it.

But I don't see a way to move the walls. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule to make a wall passable.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to be next to a wall, making ""wall is stop,"" but that's the default. I need to make ""wall is not stop.""

But without a ""not"" rule, I can't do that. Maybe I can use another rule to negate it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to be next to the key, making the key stoppable. But that doesn't help me get through the wall.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. My goal is to reach ""win."" The key and door are in the way, but I can't get to them because of the walls.

Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""baba is pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, ""baba is move,"" but","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There's also a rule ""is"" at 7 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 8 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. 

There's a ball at 4 steps up. Maybe that's useful later. Walls are scattered around, but I need to figure out how to move through them. There's a ""stop"" rule 1 step left and 3 up, which might block movement if I'm not careful. 

A door is at 4 steps right and 3 up, and a key is at 6 steps right and 3 up. So to open the door, I probably need the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so maybe I can pick it up. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""baba"" rule 2 steps left and 1 down, an ""is"" rule 1 step left and 1 down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step down. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change how Baba behaves or what counts as winning.

I think the key is to get the key first. Since the key is 1 step to the left, I should move left. But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. If I move left, I might be able to pick up the key. Let me check the map again. The key is 1 step to the left, so moving left once should get me there.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door. The door is at 4 steps right and 3 up, so after getting the key, I need to move right and up to reach it. Then, opening the door might lead me closer to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, that would help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet. For now, getting the key seems like the immediate next step.

So, I'll move left to pick up the key. That should be the first action.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So maybe I need to get the key to unlock the door, which would let me reach the win condition. But how do I get the key?

I'm currently at the starting position. The ball is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move towards the ball first. But I need to figure out the path without hitting any walls or getting stopped.

Let me visualize the map. There are walls all around, but there's a path to the right and up. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, so I need to avoid that. Maybe I can move up first to get past the stop.

Wait, if I move up, I can go towards the ball. Let me try moving up. That would take me closer to the ball and maybe towards the key and door.

Alternatively, maybe I should move right to get closer to the key and door. But the walls are in the way. Let me check the positions again.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from my current position. If I move left, I might be able to manipulate the rules, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on moving towards the key first.

I think the best course of action is to move right to get closer to the key and door. Let me try moving right.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Then there are several rules scattered around. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which seems pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door.

I notice there's a ""door"" rule 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""key"" rule 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door. But how do I move? I can only move in the four directions or idle.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the rules again.

The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. The ""you"" rule is 1 step down. Maybe I can move these to create new rules.

If I move the ""is"" rule down, I can combine it with ""baba"" or ""you"" to make new rules. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""you,"" I could make ""you is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I should try to get the key first. The key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. But wait, can I move left? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but I'm not sure if that blocks me.

I think I should try moving left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it. Then maybe I can reach the win condition.

So, my plan is: move left to get the key, then move towards the door, use the key to open it, and proceed to the win rule.

But wait, how do I use the key? In Baba Is You, you usually need to have the key and then move into the door. So, I need to have the key in my inventory, which I can do by moving onto it.

Let me try moving left. That should take me to the key. Once I have the key, I can move towards the door, which is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But I'm not sure about the exact path because of the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""stop"" rule near the walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that next to a wall, I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make the walls stop me, but that's the default. Maybe I need to change it to something else.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can walk through walls. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's focus on getting the key first. Move left to get the key, then move towards the door.

So, the first step is to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, a door, and some other stuff. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I should note the positions of important objects. The key is at 7 steps right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So, the key is to the right of the door. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door. But how?

I also see a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe the ball can be used somehow. There's a rule ""stop"" at 3 up, which might mean that if I move the ball there, it stops moving. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The walls are all around, so I need to find a path through them. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up, which might mean that if I move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I think the key is to get to the key, then use it to open the door, which would allow me to proceed further towards the win. But to get to the key, I need to move right. Let me see how many steps I can take without hitting a wall.

I'm currently at the starting position. If I move right, I can go 4 steps right and 5 up, but there's a wall there. Wait, no, the wall is at 4 right and 5 up. So maybe I can move right 4 steps and up 5, but that's blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first. Let me see. If I move up, I can go to 4 up, but there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up. So maybe I need to move around that.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can push the ball somewhere. If I move right to 1 right, then up to 4 up, I can interact with the ball. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change something. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up, which is near the win. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. My goal is to reach the win at 9 right and 5 up.
2. To get there, I need to move right as much as possible.
3. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, so I need to get that first.
4. To get to the key, I need to move right 7 steps and up 3.
5. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the path.

Looking at the walls, they are at various positions. For example, at 4 right and 5 up, 4 right and 4 up, etc. So, moving straight right might not be possible due to walls.

Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. If I move up 5 steps, I can go to 5 up, but there's a wall at 4 right and 5 up. So, I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make something else a wall, but that seems complicated.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move the ball to the ""stop"" rule, maybe the ball will stop moving, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. If I move that, maybe I can change what Baba is.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I can move that to a closer position, I can win faster.

But how do I move rules? I need to move the text blocks. So, I can move the ""win"" rule by moving the text block. But I need to get near it first.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's far. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into something else, like a key, so I can open the door without needing the key.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to see if I can get to the key first.

To get to the key at 7 right and 3 up, I need to move right 7 and up 3. Let me see if that's possible.

Starting position: let's assume I'm at (0,0). Moving right 7 would take me to (7,0). Then up 3 to (7,3). But are there walls in the way?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 4 right and 5 up, but that's above me. So maybe I can move right 4, then up, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid walls. Let me try moving up 5 steps first. That would take me to (0,5). Then right 9 to (9,5), but that's where the win is. But I need to get the key first.

Wait, maybe I can move right 4, then up 5, but that's blocked by a wall. So I need another path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right 3, then up 5, but that's also blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to use the ball somehow. If I can push the ball to break a wall or something.

The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. If I move to (1,4), I can interact with the ball. Maybe I can push it somewhere.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Maybe if I push the ball to the ""stop"" rule, it stops moving, but I don't see how that helps me progress.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. If I can move that to say ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule like ""wall is you,"" but that would make me a wall, which isn't helpful.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what ""you"" is.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should try moving right as much as possible. Let's see, if I move right 4 steps, I reach (4,0). Then up 5 steps to (4,5), but that's a wall. So I can't go there.

Alternatively, move right 3 steps to (3,0), then up 5 to (3,5), which is also a wall.

Hmm. Maybe I need to go up first. Let's try moving up 5 steps to (0,5). Then right 9 to (9,5), but that's the win. But I need to get the key first.

Wait, the key is at 7 right and 3 up. So maybe I can go up 3 first, then right 7.

Starting at (0,0), move up 3 to (0,3). Then right 7 to (7,3), which is the key. But are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the walls, at (4,3) there's a wall. So moving right 7 from (0,3) would take me through (4,3), which is blocked.

So I can't go straight right from (0,3). Maybe I need to find another path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up 4 steps to (0,4), then right 4 to (4,4), but that's a wall. So that's blocked too.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to use the door and key somehow. The door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 7 right and 3 up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door.

But to get the key, I need to reach (7,3). But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can go around.

Wait, maybe I can move up 5 steps to (0,5), then right 9 to (9,5), but that's the win. But I need the key first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a position I can reach without the key, I can win without needing the key.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to move the text block. So I need to get near it first.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's far. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am, I win.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is"" or something.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""is,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""is,"" then move ""baba"" next to ""is win.""

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move right as much as possible. Starting at (0,0), move right 4 to (4,0). Then up 5 to (4,5), but that's a wall. So I can't go there.

Alternatively, move right 3 to (3,0), then up 5 to (3,5), which is also a wall.

Hmm. Maybe I need to go up first. Move up 5 to (0,5), then right 9 to (9,5). But I need to get the key first.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make something else a key. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. If I can move that, maybe I can make another object a key.

But I'm not sure. This is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to break a wall. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it breaks the wall.

The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. If I move to (1,4), I can push the ball. But where can I push it?

If I push the ball down to (1,3), maybe it breaks the wall at (1,3). But I don't know if that works.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball to the ""stop"" rule at 3 up. If I push the ball to (1,3), which is the ""stop"" rule, maybe the ball stops moving, but I'm not sure.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving right and see what happens.

Let me try moving right 4 steps. So, right, right, right, right. That takes me to (4,0). Then up 5 steps to (4,5), but that's a wall. So I can't go there.

Alternatively, move right 3 steps to (3,0), then up 5 to (3,5), which is also a wall.

Hmm. Maybe I need to go up first. Move up 5 to (0,5), then right 9 to (9,5). But I need the key first.

Wait, the key is at 7 right and 3 up. Maybe I can move up 3 first, then right 7.

Starting at (0,0), move up 3 to (0,3). Then right 7 to (7,3), which is the key. But the path is blocked by a wall at (4,3).

So I can't go straight right from (0,3). Maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, move up 4 to (0,4), then right 4 to (4,4), but that's a wall.

This is really frustrating. Maybe I need to use the door somehow. The door is at 5 right and 3 up. If I can get the key, I can open the door.

But to get the key, I need to reach (7,3). Maybe I can go up 3, then right 7, but the wall is in the way.

Wait, maybe I can move the wall rule to make the wall at (4,3) not a wall anymore. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, making the wall at (4,3) not a wall anymore.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall at (4,3), making it stop moving or something.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move right 4 steps to (4,0), then up 3 to (4,3), which is a wall. So I can't go there.

Alternatively, move right 3 to (3,0), then up 3 to (3,3). Then right 4 to (7,3), which is the key. But is there a wall at (3,3)?

Looking back, the walls are at various positions. At (3,3), is there a wall? Let me check.

Yes, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So I can't go to (3,3).

Hmm. Maybe I can move up 2 steps to (0,2), then right 7 to (7,2). But I don't know if that's blocked.

Looking at the walls, at (4,2) there's a wall. So moving right 7 from (0,2) would take me through (4,2), which is blocked.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to use the ball to break a wall.

The ball is at (1,4). If I can push it to (1,3), which is the ""stop"" rule, maybe the ball stops there, and I can pass.

But I'm not sure. Let me try moving to (1,4), then push the ball down to (1,3). Then I can move right past (1,3) to (7,3).

But I'm not sure if that works. Maybe the ball stops moving, and I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the ball into the wall breaks the wall, allowing me to pass.

But I'm not sure how the physics work in this game. Maybe the ball can break walls.

If I push the ball to (1,3), which is a wall, maybe the wall breaks, and I can go through.

But I'm not sure. This is a risk, but maybe it's worth trying.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Move up to (1,4) to reach the ball.
3. Push the ball down to (1,3), which is a wall. Hopefully, the wall breaks.
4. Then, move right to (7,3) to get the key.
5. Use the key to open the door at (5,3).
6. Proceed to the win at (9,5).

But I'm not sure if pushing the ball into the wall will break it. Maybe I need to try.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the ball's position, making the ball stop, but I'm not sure.

This is really tricky. I think I'll try moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,4), then push the ball down to (1,3). Let's see if that works.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, and some other items. The ""WIN"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door. The ""door"" is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Hmm, maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, but I'm not sure where that is exactly. Let me visualize the map. The walls are mostly on the right side, creating a sort of corridor. The rules are spread out, but the key is near me, just 1 step to the left. Maybe I can pick it up.

I also see a ""ball"" 4 steps up. Not sure what that does yet. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up, which might mean that if I move there, I can't go further. But I'm not sure.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The walls are blocking some paths, but maybe I can find a way through. The key is close, so I should probably go get it first. Once I have the key, I can open the door, which is further up. Then, I can proceed towards the ""WIN"" rule.

But wait, how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can pick up objects by moving into them. So, if I move left once, I should be able to pick up the key. Let me try that.

After picking up the key, I can then move towards the door. The door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I need to move right and up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go around them or find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then I can't move through them, but if I can change that, maybe I can move through walls. But I don't see a ""stop"" rule near me. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up, which is a bit far.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can change it. But I'm not sure how. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine it with ""stop"" to make a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move towards the key first. Let me try moving left once to pick up the key. That should help me open the door later.

So, my plan is: move left to get the key, then move towards the door, use the key to open it, and then proceed to the ""WIN"" rule. Let's see if that works.

I think the first step is to move left to pick up the key. So, I'll choose the ""left"" action.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can navigate around it. There's also a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. 

There's another rule ""wall"" at 1 step left and 4 up. Hmm, that might be useful if I can move it. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up, which is directly above me, maybe. The ball is at 1 step right and 4 up, so that's somewhere in the upper right area.

I see walls at various positions, which might block my path. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 up, and the key is at 7 steps right and 3 up. So to get through the door, I need the key, which is further to the right.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up, which could be a problem if I run into it. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, which is near me. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step down, and ""you"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So these are all around me, maybe I can move them.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change how Baba behaves or to create a new win condition. Since the win rule is far away, maybe I can bring it closer or change what counts as winning.

I notice that the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by pushing it with other rules. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes something else the win condition.

Looking at the ""baba"" rule near me, if I can move it, I might be able to change my properties. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" I could pick up the key and unlock the door. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea is to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can get the ""win"" rule next to me, I can just step on it to win. To do that, I might need to move the ""is"" rule or other rules to create a new rule like ""baba is win.""

Wait, but how do I move the rules? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So I need to check if the ""win"" rule is movable. If it's not, I might need to create a new rule that defines something else as the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can make the ball the win condition, I can just reach it. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the key to unlock the door, but the door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 7 right and 3 up. So I need to get the key first. To get the key, I might need to move through some walls or change the rules to make the walls passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block me, but maybe I can make them passable by changing the rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is wall,"" I can walk through walls, but that might not be necessary if I can just move the walls.

I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule near me to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule down to where ""you"" is, I can create ""you is something,"" but I'm not sure what that would do.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can make ""you is something,"" but I need to see what's available. Maybe I can make ""you is win,"" so that when I step on the ""you"" rule, it triggers the win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can get the ""win"" rule next to me, I can just step on it. But I need to see if it's movable. If it's not, I might need to create a new rule.

Another approach is to use the ball. If I can make the ball the win condition, I can just reach it. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""ball is win."" But how?

I think the best approach is to try to move the ""win"" rule closer. Let me see how I can do that. I need to move the ""win"" rule from 9 right and 5 up to somewhere near me. To do that, I might need to move the ""is"" rule or other rules to create a new rule that defines the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" rule's position, I can create ""win is something,"" but I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I can create ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure how to move the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move it, I can place it next to the ""win"" rule. But I need to check if it's movable. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but I'm not sure if the rule itself is movable.

I think I need to try moving the ""is"" rule. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up. If I can move it down, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move it next to the ""win"" rule, I can create ""win is something.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule to create ""baba is something."" Maybe ""baba is win"" would work.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then whenever I step on a ""baba"" rule, it would trigger the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule down to create a new rule. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule down by one step. That would place it at 3 steps up. Then, if I can move another rule next to it, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can try moving the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""you is something.""

Wait, if I make ""you is win,"" then stepping on the ""you"" rule would win the level. That might be a good approach.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the position of the ""you"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up, and the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So I need to move the ""is"" rule down by 5 steps and right by 1 step. That seems complicated, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule up to where the ""is"" rule is. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up by 3 steps to reach the ""is"" rule's position. Then, I can create ""you is something.""

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule down to the ""you"" rule's position. Let me try that.

So, the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up. I need to move it down by 5 steps to reach the ""you"" rule's position. That would require moving down 5 times. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule up by 3 steps to meet the ""is"" rule. That might be easier.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move it up by 3 steps, it would be at 1 step right and 2 steps up. Then, I can move the ""is"" rule down to meet it.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""you"" rule. Maybe I can push it with other rules.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the key and door. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So I need to get the key to open the door. But to get to the key, I might need to move through some walls or change the rules.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block me, but maybe I can make them passable by changing the rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is wall,"" I can walk through walls, but that might not be necessary if I can just move the walls.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the win condition or make the path easier. Since the win rule is far away, maybe I can bring it closer or change what counts as winning.

Another idea is to use the ball. The ball is at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can make the ball the win condition, I can just reach it. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, maybe I can create a rule like ""ball is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule right by 1 step to meet the ""ball"" rule.

If I can do that, then ""ball is win"" would be the new rule, and stepping on the ball would win the level. That seems promising.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 4 steps up to 1 step right and 4 steps up. That would create the rule ""ball is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not ""stop."" I think the ""is"" rule is movable because it's just a rule block.

So, I can move the ""is"" rule right by 1 step. That would place it next to the ""ball"" rule, creating ""ball is win.""

Once that's done, I just need to go to the ball to win. The ball is at 1 step right and 4 up, so I can move right and up to reach it.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the path. I need to move right and up to reach the ball. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the walls.

There's a wall at 4 right and 5 up, which is above me. Another wall at 4 right and 4 up, which is directly to the right. So I can't move right because of the wall.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I need to change the wall rules to make them passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change what counts as a wall. For example, if I make ""wall is passable,"" then I can walk through walls.

But how do I do that? I need to create a new rule like ""wall is passable."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule left by 1 step to meet the ""wall"" rule.

If I do that, the rule becomes ""wall is something."" But I need to define what ""something"" is. Maybe I can make ""wall is passable"" by moving another rule.

Wait, I don't have a ""passable"" rule. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it next to the ""wall"" rule, I can make ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop me, but that's the default behavior.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, which might not help.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to see what happens.

So, moving the ""is"" rule left by 1 step would place it at 3 up and 1 left. Then, if I can move another rule next to it, I can create a new rule.

But I'm not sure what to do next. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me go back to the idea of making ""ball is win."" If I can do that, I just need to reach the ball. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move the walls.

The walls are at various positions. If I can move the wall at 4 right and 4 up, I can create a path. But how?

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change the properties of walls. For example, if I make ""wall is move,"" then walls can be moved.

But I don't have a ""move"" rule. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is passable,"" I can walk through them.

But I don't have a ""passable"" rule either. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, which is the default. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is key."" Then, walls would be keys, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is door,"" but that might not help either.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can bring the ""win"" rule next to me, I can just step on it.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's too far. Maybe I can move it left by 5 steps and down by 5 steps to bring it next to me. But that seems impossible.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that makes something else the win condition. For example, ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition, so stepping on any ""baba"" rule would win the level.

But I'm not sure how to create that rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I can create ""baba is something.""

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" rule's position, I can create ""baba is something."" But I need to define what ""something"" is. Maybe I can make ""baba is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule after it's moved to the ""baba"" rule's position. That seems complicated.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So I need to move the ""win"" rule left by 5 steps and down by 1 step to meet the ""is"" rule.

But I don't know if that's possible. Maybe I can push it with other rules.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the key and door again. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So I need to get the key to open the door. But to get to the key, I need to move right, but there's a wall blocking me.

Wait, the wall is at 4 right and 4 up. If I can move that wall down, I can create a path. But how?

I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So if the wall is defined as ""stop,"" I can't move it. But if I can change the wall's properties, I might be able to move it.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, I can change what walls are. For example, if I make ""wall is move,"" then walls can be moved.

But I don't have a ""move"" rule. Alternatively, if I make ""wall is passable,"" I can walk through them.

But I don't have a ""passable"" rule. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule. If I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, which is the default. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is key."" Then, walls would be keys, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is door,"" but that might not help either.

I'm stuck again. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to create a new rule. If I can do that, I can redefine the win condition.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule right by 5 steps and up by 1 step to meet the ""win"" rule.

But that's a long way. Maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win","

Looking at the objects, there's a ball, a key, and various walls. The rules are spread out, and I need to see how I can manipulate them. The walls are all around, so movement might be restricted, but maybe I can break through them by changing the rules.

I see a ""stop"" rule, which probably makes objects immovable. If I can move that, maybe I can make some walls movable. Also, there's a ""door"" and a ""key"" rule. Maybe I need to use the key to open the door, but I'm not sure how that works yet.

The ball is somewhere on the map. Maybe I can use it to push other objects or rules into place. I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which could be used to create new properties or change existing ones.

I think the key is to rearrange the rules to make Baba able to move through walls or change the win condition. Maybe if I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win by being somewhere specific. Alternatively, I could try to make the key or door part of the win condition.

I should probably start by moving towards the ball or the key to see if I can use them to manipulate the rules. Since the ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, I need to navigate there. But there are walls in the way, so I might need to break through them or find a path.

Wait, if I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make a wall movable. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it might make that wall stop me, but if I can remove it, the wall becomes passable. Alternatively, I could create a new rule like ""wall is push"" to make walls movable.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should try moving towards the ball first. Let me see, from my current position, I need to go right and up to reach the ball. But there are walls blocking me. Maybe I can move around them or find a way to break through.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rules to create new combinations. For example, if I can get ""baba is key,"" I might be able to pick up the key and use it on the door. Or maybe ""key is win"" would make the key the win condition, so I just need to pick it up.

I think the best approach is to try to move towards the ball and see if I can use it to push other objects or rules into place. If I can't get through, I'll have to find another way to manipulate the rules to make the level easier.

So, I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ball. That should help me begin manipulating the necessary rules or objects to achieve the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, a door, and the win rule. The win rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice a key that's 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door.

I need to figure out how to move. The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. I can't move through walls unless I change the rules. Right now, the walls are defined as ""wall,"" so they're probably blocking me.

I see a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change how walls behave. Also, there's a ""door"" rule 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I can use the key to open the door, but I need to get there first.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the layout again. The walls are mostly on the right side, so maybe I should move left to get the key.

But before I do that, I should check if I can change any rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would block movement, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is push,"" I could push walls, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can bring the win condition to where I am, I can win without moving far. The win rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up, which is quite a distance. Maybe I can move it left somehow.

Wait, I see a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. If I can move that, I might be able to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I could make ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition, but that might not help.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. If I move it up, maybe I can combine it with another rule to change my abilities.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to move left to get the key first. If I can get the key, maybe I can open the door and access the win condition. So, I'll try moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

There's another wall at 1 step left and 4 up, which might be blocking something.

There's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe that's part of the puzzle. Walls are scattered around, and there are other rules like ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""key"" at various positions. The key is at 7 steps right and 3 up, which might be useful for opening a door.

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move these rules to change the active rules. If I can move ""baba"" and ""you"" closer, perhaps I can create a new rule that helps me reach the win.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up and also at 1 step down. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""you"" in a different way. If I can make ""you"" into something else, like a key or a door, that might help me progress.

I'm a bit confused about how to move the rules. I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So I need to find a way to move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules without being blocked. Maybe I can move left or right to get closer to the rules I need to change.

Let me try to move right first. If I go right, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 5 up. But that's still too far. Maybe I should move up to get closer to the ""win"" rule. But there are walls in the way. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should move down to access the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules. If I can move down, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and rearrange it. Let me try moving down a step. That might allow me to interact with the ""is"" rule at 1 step down.

Wait, if I move down, I can get to the ""is"" rule and maybe move it to connect ""baba"" and ""you"" differently. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key and open the door. That might be a way to proceed.

So, I think moving down is the best option right now. It allows me to access the rules that can change my properties, which might help me reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's probably blocking my way. Then there's a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. There's also a ""wall"" rule 1 step left and 4 up, which might be useful for changing walls into something else.

There's a ball 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe that's a collectible or something I can use. Walls are scattered around, and there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up, which could make things immovable. Doors and keys are present too, which might require me to unlock something.

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move these rules to change what Baba is. If I can make Baba into something else, like a key or a door, that might help me progress.

The key is 1 step to the left, so maybe I need to collect it to open a door. But first, I need to get to the key. The walls are in the way, so perhaps I can break a rule to make the walls passable.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Since the key is 1 step left, I should move left. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking me. The wall is 4 steps right and 1 step down, so maybe I can go around it.

Wait, if I move left, I might be able to reach the key. Let me try moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, and some other items. The key is one step to the right, and there's a door six steps to the right and three up. There's also a rule ""key"" eight steps to the right and three up. Hmm, maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is one step to the right and three up. That might mean that the wall or something else is stopping me. I also see a ball two steps to the right and four up. Maybe the ball can be used to break something or change a rule.

The rules are a bit confusing. There's ""wall"" four steps up, which might mean that walls are defined as stop. I need to be careful not to move into walls unless I can change the rules.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and reach the win condition. So, I'll try moving right to get closer to the key.

But wait, there's a wall five steps to the right and one step up. I don't want to hit that. Maybe I can move up or down to avoid it. Let me check the positions again.

The key is one step to the right, so moving right once should get me to the key. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking me. The wall is five steps to the right, so if I'm currently at position (0,0), moving right once would take me to (1,0), which is where the key is. That seems safe.

After picking up the key, I can then move towards the door. The door is six steps to the right and three up. So, I'll need to move right five more steps and up three steps. But I have to make sure there are no walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the walls won't stop me anymore. But that might be more complicated.

For now, I'll focus on getting the key. So, moving right once should do it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a door, a key, and some other text blocks. The key is one step to the left, and the door is five steps to the right and three steps up. There's also a rule ""stop"" which is three steps up. I need to figure out how to move around these.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something is stopping me. The ""stop"" rule might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. I also notice there's a ""key"" which is probably needed to open the ""door."" So, maybe I need to get the key first.

The key is one step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. But I need to make sure that moving left doesn't take me into a wall or something that stops me. Let me check the walls. There are walls at various positions, but I'm currently at the starting point, so moving left should be okay.

Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is five steps to the right and three steps up. That seems like a path I can take after getting the key. But I also need to consider the rules. There are several ""is"" rules, which might be defining other objects or properties.

Wait, there's a ""rule `win`"" at nine steps to the right and five steps up. That's pretty far. Maybe I need to create a new rule to change the win condition or make something else winnable. But for now, I'll focus on getting the key and opening the door.

So, my plan is: move left to get the key, then move right and up to reach the door. Once I have the key, the door should open, and I can proceed further. Let me try moving left first.

But before I do that, I should check if moving left is possible. Are there any walls blocking me? The walls are at various positions, but I don't see one directly to my left. So, moving left should be safe.

Alright, I'll move left to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice a key that's 1 step to the right. Maybe I need that to open a door?

Let me visualize the map. There's a wall structure that seems to be 5 steps to the right and 5 steps up. The rules are spread out, with ""is"" and ""win"" further to the right. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. There's a door 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a key 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, the key is to the right of the door.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the right, but in the previous observation, it was 1 step to the left. Maybe I moved it? Or perhaps the map shifted. I need to be careful with the directions.

I have the ball, which might be useful. Maybe I can push it somewhere. The door is in the way, so I probably need the key to open it. But how do I get the key? It's 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can move towards it.

But first, I should check if I can move freely. The walls are in the way, but I can move around them if possible. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, which might block me. I need to avoid that.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I need to move right to reach the key. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go up first to bypass some walls. Let me see: moving up 5 steps would take me near the win rule, but that's too far. Alternatively, moving right and up in a zigzag might help.

Wait, the ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can push the ball, maybe it can break through a wall or something. But I'm not sure how that works in this context.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange some rules. The ""is"" and ""wall"" rules are nearby. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall,"" maybe I can create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" or something. That could make the walls immovable, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can make the walls stop me, that might prevent me from moving through them, but I need to get past them to reach the key and win.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is 1 step to the right, but in the previous observation, it was 1 step to the left. Maybe I need to move left to get it. But I'm not sure where I am exactly.

Let me try to move right a few steps to see if I can reach the key. If I move right, I might hit a wall, but perhaps there's a path. Alternatively, moving up first could open a way.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe if I can change that, I can become something else, but I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving right. If I can't, maybe I need to move up first to bypass the walls.

So, I'll try moving right. If that's blocked, I'll adjust my path.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I should note the positions of the rules. There's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. That probably means that any wall is a stopper, so I can't move through them. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up, which is a bit confusing. There's also a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up, which might mean that something is stopping me.

I see a ball 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use that somehow. The door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, to open the door, I probably need the key. But how do I get the key?

I also notice that there's a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step down, an ""is"" rule 1 step down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. These might be important for changing the rules.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules, maybe I can redefine what ""you"" is. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" then I could control the key and move it to the door. But how do I do that?

I need to move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules next to the key. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and the ""you"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""baba"" rule next to something else. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key as Baba. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Let me think about the movement. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to get closer to the key and the door. The door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so maybe I can move towards that area.

But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various steps up. So, I might need to find a path around them. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls.

Wait, if I move up, I can get to the area where the ""is"" and ""win"" rules are. Maybe I can manipulate those rules to change the win condition or make something else winnable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to prevent something from moving. But I'm not sure how that would help.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps I need to take:

1. Identify the win condition's position and figure out how to reach it.
2. Determine if there are any obstacles, like walls, that I need to bypass or remove.
3. Look for keys or doors that might require me to collect a key first.
4. Consider if I need to change the rules by moving ""is"" or ""you"" rules to redefine objects.

Given that the win rule is far to the right and up, and there are walls blocking the way, I think I need to find a way to either move the walls or find a path around them. Alternatively, maybe I can redefine the win condition to be something closer.

Wait, if I can make ""key is win,"" then maybe I can just pick up the key and that would be the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Let me try to move towards the key. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. I need to get there, but there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move up first to get around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key to create a new rule. If I can make ""key is you,"" then I can control the key and move it towards the door.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move towards it step by step.

Wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the layout again. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various steps up, so moving right might be blocked. Maybe I should move up first to get a better path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to access the ""wall"" rule and change it. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through walls. But I'm not sure how to do that.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either change the win condition or make the key accessible. Let me try to move towards the key area.

I'll start by moving right to get closer to the key. But there are walls at 4 steps to the right. Maybe I can move up first to go over them.

Wait, if I move up, I can get to the area where the ""is"" and ""win"" rules are. Maybe I can create a new rule there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to the key to make the key controllable. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move it next to the key, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, that might work.

But moving the ""you"" rule that far seems difficult. Maybe I can move the key instead. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move it left towards me, that would help.

Wait, if I can make ""key is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""push.""

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down:

- My goal is to reach the win condition, which is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up.
- There are walls blocking the direct path.
- There's a door and a key, so I might need to collect the key to open the door.
- The rules can be manipulated to change the game's mechanics.

Perhaps the solution involves redefining the win condition to be the key, so that when I pick up the key, I win. To do that, I need to make ""key is win.""

To create that rule, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""win"" rule. The ""is"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to where the key is. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to the key's position and then move the ""win"" rule next to it. That would create ""key is win.""

But moving the ""is"" rule 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up to the key's position (7 steps right, 3 up) would require moving it left and down. Is that possible?

I think I need to move the ""is"" rule closer to the key. Let me try to move towards the ""is"" rule.

I'll start by moving right to get closer to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 5 up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move up first to bypass them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to create a new character that can move through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""pass.""

I'm not sure. This is getting too abstract. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move towards the key. I'll move right as much as possible, then up. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move up first to go over them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to prevent the walls from stopping me. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""not"" rule (if there is one) or find another way.

Wait, I don't see a ""not"" rule. Maybe I can redefine ""wall"" as something else.

If I can make ""wall is you,"" then I can control the walls, but that doesn't help me pass through them.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push them aside. But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another way. Let me check the objects again.

There's a ball 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, if I can make ""ball is bomb,"" then I can explode it to break walls. But I don't see a ""bomb"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is push"" to push it into walls.

I'm not making progress. Let me try to move towards the key step by step.

I'll start by moving right to get closer. But the walls are at 4 steps right, so I can't go beyond that. Maybe I can move up to go around.

I'll move up to the first available spot, then right. Let's see:

1. Move up to avoid the wall.
2. Then move right towards the key.

But I'm not sure if that works. Let me try to visualize the map.

The walls are at 4 steps right and various steps up, so moving up to 5 steps up and then right might be possible.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up, which is beyond the walls. Maybe I can move up to 5 steps and then right.

But I need to get past the walls. Maybe I can move up to 5 steps, then right past the walls.

Let me try that:

1. Move up 5 steps.
2. Then move right towards the win rule.

But I'm not sure if that's possible because the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move up to 5 steps, then right.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new path.

I'm not making progress. I think I need to try moving towards the key and see what happens.

I'll move right as much as possible, then up.

But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move up first.

I'll move up to 5 steps, then right towards the win rule.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, so if I can get to 5 up, I can move right to 9.

But how do I get past the walls at 4 right?

Maybe I can move up to 5, then right past the walls.

Let me try that:

1. Move up 5 steps.
2. Then move right to 9.

But I'm not sure if that works because the walls are at 4 right and 5 up. So moving right at 5 up might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to 5, then right to 8, then up or down.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. So if I can get there, maybe I can manipulate it.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""you"" rule next to the key to make the key controllable. The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move it to the key's position, which is 7 right and 3 up, that would make the key ""you.""

But moving the ""you"" rule that far seems difficult. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key towards me by redefining it.

Wait, if I can make ""key is push,"" then I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

I'm not making progress. I think I need to try moving towards the key and see if I can collect it somehow.

I'll move right as much as possible, then up to reach the key.

But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move up first to go over them.

I'll move up to 5 steps, then right to 7 to get the key.

Wait, the key is at 7 right and 3 up. So if I move up to 3, then right to 7, I can get it.

But the walls are at 4 right and various up steps. So moving right to 7 at 3 up might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to 4, then right to 7.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to try moving up to 4, then right.

Let me try:

1. Move up to 4 steps.
2. Then move right to 7.

But there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up. So I can't move right beyond 4 at 4 up.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to prevent the walls from stopping me. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through them.

But I don't see a ""not"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""not.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe the walls won't stop me.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""stop"" rule. It's 3 steps up, so I need to get there.

I'll move up to 3 steps, then see if I can move the ""stop"" rule.

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. The ball is 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can push it somewhere.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can make ""ball is push.""

But I don't have a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""push.""

I'm not making progress. I think I need to try moving towards the key and see what happens.

I'll move right as much as possible, then up.

But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move up first to go over them.

I'll move up to 5 steps, then right to 9 to reach the win rule.

But the walls are at 4 right and 5 up, so I can't move right beyond 4 at 5 up.

Hmm, this is frustrating. Maybe I need to look for another way.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule to a closer position. If I can make ""something is win,"" then I can win without going all the way to 9 right and 5 up.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to move the ""is"" rule next to something else and the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so that I win immediately. But I don't think that's possible because ""baba is you"" is already the rule.

Wait, if I can make ""you is win,"" then when I move, I win. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck. I need to try something. Maybe I'll move right to get closer to the key.

I'll move right to 4 steps, but there's a wall there. Maybe I can move up to go over it.

I'll move up to 5 steps, then right to 8, then up or down.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. Maybe I can manipulate it there.

But I'm not sure. I think I need to try moving there.

I'll move up to 5, then right to 8.

But the wall is at 4 right and 5 up, so I can't move right beyond 4 at 5 up.

This is really confusing. I think I need to try a different approach.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to create a new character that can help me. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule to make ""baba is key.""

But I'm not sure. I think I'm stuck.

I think I'll try to move towards the key as much as possible. I'll move right to 4, then up to 3, then right to 7 to get the key.

But the walls are blocking me at 4 right. Maybe I can move up to 3, then right to 7.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 3 up. So moving right to 7 at 3 up is blocked.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I need to try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me.

I'll move towards the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 5 up. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move up to 5, then right to 8.

But the wall is at 4 right and 5 up, so I can't move right beyond 4 at 5 up.

I'm stuck. I think I need to try a different approach. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule next to the key to make it controllable.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Then there are several rules placed around: ""is"" at 8 right and 5 up, ""win"" at 9 right and 5 up, ""wall"" at 1 left and 4 up, another ""is"" at 4 up, a ball at 1 right and 4 up, and so on. There's also a key 1 step to the right and a wall 4 steps to the right. The rules ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" are placed near the bottom.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change how objects behave. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or pull text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to something else, I might change what counts as winning.

I notice there's a key nearby. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock a door. But to do that, I might need to change the rules so that I can move through walls or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can make the key into a different object.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm trying to reach the key, which is 1 step to the right, maybe I should move right. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking me. The wall is 4 steps to the right, so moving right once should be okay.

Wait, but if I move right, I might be able to get closer to the key. Let me try that. So, I'll choose the right action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also see a key that's 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to open a door or something.

The rules on the map include ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""key."" I think I can manipulate these rules by moving the text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe I can make that wall stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

I also notice that there's a ball 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure how. The door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the key is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So the key is to the right of the door. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left, so it's closer to me. Maybe I can pick up the key and then go to the door. But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can pick up objects by moving into them, but I need to make sure I can move there.

Looking at the walls, they're mostly on the right side, creating a sort of barrier. The walls are at 3 steps to the right and various steps up. So the right side is blocked by walls, but maybe I can go around or break through.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule 2 steps to the left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is 1 step down. Maybe I can manipulate these to change what Baba is. For example, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can become the key and open the door.

But first, I need to get to the key. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can move left once to pick it up. Then, I can go to the door, which is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But wait, moving right is blocked by walls. Maybe I can break the walls by changing the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall to make it stop me, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps I can move the ""door"" rule to change its behavior.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's the target. I need to get there. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the walls stop being walls or to make myself able to pass through them. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls out of the way.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" and ""push"" rules next to a wall. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's an ""is"" rule 7 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and another one 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move one of these to a wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" to change the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up. Then, I can go to the door, which is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can use the key to open the door, but I need to get to the door first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to change its behavior. If I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through without needing the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door rule. Let me see, the door rule is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the door, I can create a new rule like ""door is open.""

But moving the ""is"" rule requires me to move it step by step. I need to plan the path. Let me see, I'm currently at the starting position. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So I can move left once, then up four times to reach it.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it next to the door rule. That would create ""door is [something]."" If I can make it ""door is open,"" then the door will open automatically.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is pass"" or something like that. I'm not sure what the exact rule is, but I think making the door passable is the key.

Wait, but I also have a key. Maybe I need to use the key to open the door. But to get to the door, I need to move right, which is blocked by walls. So perhaps I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls to clear a path. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then next to ""push.""

But I'm not sure where the ""push"" rule is. I don't see it listed in the objects. Maybe I need to create it by moving other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" to change the win condition to myself, but that might not help.

Wait, the ball is 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. But I'm not sure how.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Then, move up to reach the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""is"" rule next to the door rule to make ""door is open.""
4. Then, go to the door and pass through.
5. Proceed to the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules differently.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is key"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to Baba and the key. That way, I can become the key and open the door without picking it up.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to Baba and then next to the key, it would create ""baba is key."" Then, I would have the key's properties, allowing me to open the door.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So I can move left once, then up four times to get it.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it next to Baba, who is at my current position. Then, I can move it next to the key, which is 1 step to the left. So, after picking up the ""is"" rule, I can move it to the key's position, creating ""baba is key.""

That might work. Let me try that.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move left again to reach the ""is"" rule (since it's 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, but I'm already left once, so maybe I need to move up instead).
Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me visualize the map.

I'm at the starting position. The key is 1 step to the left. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So, to reach the ""is"" rule, I need to move left once and up four times.

But I also need to pick up the key first. So:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Then, move left again and up four times to get the ""is"" rule.
3. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to Baba (myself) and then next to the key to create ""baba is key.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right sequence. Maybe I should prioritize moving the ""is"" rule first.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the door to make it open.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either make the door open or make the walls passable. Since the walls are blocking the path, I need to find a way around them.

Another idea: if I can make ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help. Or maybe ""wall is push"" to push them.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so maybe I need to create it by moving other rules.

Wait, the ball is 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to push the walls. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to move the walls.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is you"" to control the ball and use it to push.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the win rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's the target. The key is 1 step to the left. The door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, to get to the door, I need to go right, but the walls are blocking.

Wait, maybe I can go up first. The ball is 4 steps up. Maybe I can go up to the ball and use it somehow.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I can make ""ball is win"" to change the win condition to the ball, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is push"" to push the walls.

But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I need to create it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. Maybe I can use that. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""stop is you,"" but that would make me stop, which isn't helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to break down the problem.

First, identify what's blocking me: the walls on the right. I need to get past them to reach the door and the win condition.

Options to get past walls:

1. Make walls passable by changing their rule.
2. Find a way around the walls.
3. Use an object to break or move the walls.

Since the walls are in a straight line, maybe I can go around them by moving up or down.

Looking at the map, the walls are at 3 steps to the right and various steps up. So, if I move up or down, I might find a gap.

Wait, the key is 1 step to the left. Maybe I can go left, pick up the key, then go up or down to find a path.

But the walls are on the right, so going left might not help. Unless there's a way to go around on the left side.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location, but that might not be necessary.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by staying where I am, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step down. Maybe I can manipulate that. If I can make ""you is win,"" then reaching myself would win, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is key"" to become the key.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently.

I need to reach the win condition, which is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. To get there, I need to move right past the walls. So, I need to find a way to make the walls not block me.

One way is to make ""wall is pass."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and then next to ""pass.""

But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is push"" and then push them aside.

But again, I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving ""is"" and ""push"" together, but I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe the ball can be used as a pusher. If I can make ""ball is push,"" then I can use the ball to push the walls.

But I need to create that rule. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to ""push."" But I don't have a ""push"" rule, so maybe I need to create it by moving other rules.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the door to make it open. So, the door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the door's location.

To do that, I can:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule's column.
2. Move up four times to reach it.
3. Then, move right five times and down one step to reach the door.

But that seems like a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it's the right path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is you,"" allowing me to pick it up and use it to open the door.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Then, move left again and up four times to get the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""is"" rule next to the key to make ""key is you.""
4. Then, I can use the key to open the door.

But I'm not sure if that's how it works. Maybe I need to make ""baba is key"" instead.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is open"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the door.

I think that's a better approach. So, let's try that.

Steps:

1. Move left once to pick up the key.
2. Move left again to reach the ""is"" rule's column.
3. Move up four times to reach the ""is"" rule.
4. Then, move right five times and down one step to place the ""is"" rule next to the door.
5. This creates ""door is open,"" allowing me to pass through.
6. Then, move to the door and proceed to the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the exact path. Maybe I need to adjust the steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door without picking up the key first.

But I think picking up the key is necessary to open the door, even if I make the door open.

Wait, if I make ""door is open,"" then I don't need the key. So maybe I can skip picking up the key.

But I'm not sure. Let me try that.

So, steps:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule's column.
2. Move up four times to get the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right five times and down one step to place it next to the door.
4. Now, the door is open.
5. Move to the door and proceed to the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I need to make ""door is open"" by placing ""is"" and ""open"" next to it, but I don't see an ""open"" rule.

Wait, maybe the ""win"" rule is the target, so I need to reach it. The win rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. So, I need to get there.

But the path is blocked by walls. So, I need to find a way to get past them.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win without moving, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" but that would make the walls me, which doesn't help.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. Maybe I can use that. If I can make ""stop is you,"" then I would stop, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is stop,"" but I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to the door to see what happens.

So, I'll try to move the ""is"" rule to the door's location.

Steps:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule's column.
2. Move up four times to get the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right five times and down one step to place it next to the door.
4. Now, the door has the ""is"" rule next to it, creating a new rule like ""door is [something].""
5. If I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through.

But I'm not sure if that's how it works. Maybe I need to have both ""is"" and ""open"" next to the door, but I don't see an ""open"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe just having ""is"" next to the door is enough to make it passable.

I think I'll try that. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to the door.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position to the door's position.

So, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. The door is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up.

So, the difference is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down.

I can move the ""is""","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up. Then there are several rules: ""is"" at 7 right and 5 up, ""win"" at 8 right and 5 up, ""wall"" at 2 left and 4 up, another ""is"" at 1 left and 4 up, a ball at 4 up, and so on. There's also a key 1 step to the left and a wall 3 steps to the right.

Hmm, I notice that the ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. To reach that, I might need to move right several times. But there are walls blocking the way. Let me see the path: starting from my position, moving right 3 steps would hit a wall. Maybe I can move up first to bypass the walls.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the rules. But I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So I need to see if I can move any rules to create a new path.

I see a ""key"" 1 step to the left. Maybe I can pick up the key to unlock a door. There's a ""door"" rule at 4 right and 3 up. If I have the key, perhaps I can go through the door. But how do I get the key? It's 1 step to the left, so I can move left once to get it.

Once I have the key, I can approach the door. But the door is at 4 right and 3 up. So after getting the key, I need to move right 4 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break the wall rule by moving the ""wall"" rule somewhere else.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Maybe I can use the existing rules to my advantage.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule to a different position to create a new path.

Let me plan my steps:

1. Move left once to pick up the key.
2. Move right 4 steps and up 3 steps to reach the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed towards the ""win"" rule.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. There are walls at 3 right and various up positions. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me try moving up 5 steps first, then right 8 steps to reach the ""win"" rule.

Wait, moving up 5 steps might not be possible due to walls. Let me check the walls:

- Wall at 3 right and 5 up: That's where I need to go. So I can't go straight up.

Maybe I should move right first, then up. But the walls are blocking the right path. Alternatively, I can move left to get the key, then find a way around.

I think the best approach is to move left to get the key, then use it to open the door, and proceed towards the win condition. So my first action should be to move left once to pick up the key.

The door is five steps to the right and three steps up, and the key is seven steps to the right and three steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door.

The rules are scattered around. There's a ""wall"" rule, an ""is"" rule, a ""stop"" rule, a ""door"" rule, a ""key"" rule, and others. I think I can move these rules around to change the game's mechanics. For example, if I can make ""key is you,"" then I can move the key as if it's me, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

I also notice that there's a ""ball"" object four steps up. Maybe the ball can be used somehow, but I'm not sure how yet. The walls are all around, so I need to find a path through them or change their properties.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. Maybe I can move a ""stop"" rule onto a wall to make it passable. Or perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls.

Let me think about the positions. The key is one step to the left, so if I can get to it, I might be able to use it to open the door. The door is five steps to the right and three up, which is a bit far. I need to figure out how to get there.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can combine them with other objects to create new rules. For example, if I can place ""is"" next to ""win,"" I might change the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and five up. That's pretty far. Maybe I don't need to go all the way there. Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to something closer.

I think the key is the most important object here. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition. So, my first goal should be to reach the key.

To get to the key, which is one step to the left, I need to move left. But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me check if there are any walls blocking me. The walls are mostly to the right and up, so maybe moving left is possible.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, but I'm not sure where exactly I am. Maybe I need to move left once to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go towards the door.

After getting the key, I can move towards the door, which is five steps to the right and three up. That seems like a path I can take once I have the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball somehow. If I can make the ball push the key or something, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Another thought: if I can change the rules so that the key becomes something else, like a passable object, that might help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the simplest approach is to move left to get the key, then move right and up towards the door. Once I open the door, I can proceed towards the win condition.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move right and up towards the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed towards the win condition.

Let me try moving left first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the right, which might be useful for opening a door. The door is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the key is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I might need to get the key to open the door.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the right and up, which might create a barrier. I also see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, which probably means that object can't be moved. So, I need to be careful about that.

The ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. Maybe it's just an obstacle or part of a rule I can manipulate.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could change the win condition. Or perhaps I can make Baba into something else to bypass obstacles.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me plan my path. I need to get to the key first, which is 1 step to the right. But wait, the key is also 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That seems conflicting. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Oh, the key is 1 step to the right, and another key is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, there are two keys? Or maybe it's the same key described differently. I need to clarify that.

Assuming the key is 1 step to the right, I can move right once to pick it up. Then, I can proceed towards the door, which is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls in the way. I need to see if I can move any walls or rules to create a path.

Looking at the rules, I can move ""is"" and ""wall"" rules. If I move a ""wall"" rule next to an object, it might make that object a wall, which could block or unblock paths. Alternatively, I can break existing rules by moving their components apart.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change the environment. For example, if I can make the door into something else, I might not need the key. Or, I can make the walls into something movable.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to change the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by reaching myself, which might be easier. But I need to get close enough to move the rules.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ball to make the ball movable, then use it to break through walls. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Another idea: if I can move the ""baba"" rule to make myself into a key, I can open the door without needing the physical key. That might be a clever way to bypass obstacles.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step down. If I can move ""is"" next to ""key"" and then next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is key."" Then, I can use myself as the key to open the door.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move down to get near the ""baba"" rule.
2. Move left or right to position the ""is"" rule next to ""key.""
3. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is key.""
4. Now, as Baba, I can act as a key, so I can open the door without needing the physical key.
5. Proceed through the door towards the win condition.

But I need to make sure I can move the rules without getting blocked by walls or the ""stop"" rule. I should also check if moving the rules will break any existing necessary rules.

Alternatively, if I can't manipulate the rules that way, I might need to find another path. Maybe there's a way around the walls. Let me see the layout again.

The walls are at various positions, but there's a gap at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, where the key is. So, perhaps moving right and up can help me navigate around the walls.

I think the best approach is to try to change myself into a key by manipulating the rules. That way, I can open the door and proceed to the win condition without needing to collect the physical key, which might be blocked by walls.

So, I'll start by moving down to access the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and then next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is key."" Once that's done, I can use myself as the key to open the door and reach the win.

Let me try that step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball, a key, and various walls, doors, and rules. The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I notice there's a key 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to pick that up to open a door. The door is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and maybe access a path to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That might mean that the wall there stops movement. I need to see if I can move the walls or the rules to change that.

I also see a ""baba"" rule 1 step down. Maybe I can manipulate that to change what Baba is. If I can make Baba into something else, like a key or a door, that might help me progress.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba is key,"" then Baba would become a key, allowing me to open the door without needing the separate key.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move objects that aren't ""stop."" So I need to check if the ""is"" rules are movable. If they are, I can rearrange them to create new rules.

Looking at the map, the ""is"" rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up, and another at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can move one of these to combine with ""baba"" or ""key.""

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can create a new rule like ""baba is something."" That could change Baba's properties.

Alternatively, the ""key"" is 1 step to the right. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the key, I can make ""key is something,"" maybe turning it into a tool I need.

I also see a ""door"" rule 6 steps right and 3 up. If I can get the key to the door, I can open it. But the door is behind walls, so I might need to break through or find another way.

Another thought: the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe I can change the win condition by creating a new rule. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, which might be easier to reach.

But I don't know if that's possible. I need to see if I can move the ""win"" rule or combine it with something else.

Let me try to plan step by step. First, I need to get the key. It's 1 step to the right. So I can move right once to pick it up. Then, I can use the key to open the door. But the door is 6 steps right and 3 up. So I need to navigate there, possibly moving up and right.

But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 5 steps right and various up positions. I need to see if I can move around them or break through. If the walls are ""stop,"" I can't pass through them, so I need to find a path or change the rules to make the walls passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 4 steps up. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make walls not stop me. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block my path anymore.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and then next to ""not stop."" But I don't see a ""not stop"" rule. Maybe I can create it by rearranging existing rules.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move it somewhere else, the wall won't stop me anymore.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""stop"" rule. It depends on whether it's movable. If it's not, I might need another approach.

Another idea: use the ball. The ball is 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I can push the ball to break through walls or to reach higher places. But I need to see how the ball interacts with the environment.

Wait, the ball is just an object. If I can make it into a tool, like a ""ball is push,"" then I can use it to move other objects. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not be possible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to focus on the key and the door. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win.

So, first step: move right to get the key. Then, move towards the door, which is 6 steps right and 3 up. But I need to navigate around or through the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the door closer by rearranging the rules. If I can make ""door is you,"" then I can control the door and move it to where I need it.

But that seems a bit advanced. Maybe I should start by getting the key and see where that leads me.

Wait, the key is only 1 step to the right. That's easy to reach. So I'll move right once to pick it up. Then, I can move towards the door.

But the door is behind walls. I need to find a path or a way to remove the walls. Maybe I can use the key to open the door, which might be the only way through.

Alternatively, if I can make the walls passable, I can go through them without needing the key. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best approach is to get the key first. So, I'll move right once to pick it up. Then, I'll move towards the door, using the key when I reach it.

But I need to make sure I can reach the door. Let me check the path. From my current position, moving right and up should get me closer. But I have to avoid the walls that stop me.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up. So, if I move right and up, I might hit that wall. I need to find a way around it.

Maybe I can move up first to bypass the wall. Let me see: moving up once, then right, then up again. That might help me avoid the stopping wall.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, I can pass through. But I don't know if I can move it. If I can, I'll do that. If not, I'll have to find another path.

I think the key is the most straightforward next step. So, I'll move right once to get the key. Then, I'll proceed towards the door, using the key when I reach it.

But I need to make sure I can open the door once I get there. So, after picking up the key, I'll move towards the door's position, which is 6 steps right and 3 up from the starting point.

Wait, from my current position, moving right 6 steps and up 3 steps would take me to the door. But I have to navigate through the existing walls. Maybe I can go around them by moving up first.

Let me plan the path: move right once to get the key, then move up three times, then right five more times to reach the door. But I need to check if that path is clear.

Looking at the walls, they are at 5 steps right and various up positions. So, moving up first might help me avoid the walls that are further to the right.

Alternatively, I can move right and up in a way that avoids the walls. Maybe move right a few steps, then up, then right again.

I think the key is essential, so I'll prioritize getting it. Once I have the key, I can focus on opening the door and proceeding towards the win.

So, my next action is to move right once to pick up the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that the rule ""wall"" is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that rule to change what counts as a wall. If I can make something else a wall, I might be able to clear a path.

I also see a ball at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up, which might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to bypass it.

Let me think about the rules. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and another ""is"" at 4 steps up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can rearrange these, I might be able to change my properties or the properties of other objects.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule to a different position to see if I can make a wall passable. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to remove the stopping effect from certain areas.

Wait, the key is at 7 steps right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 steps right and 3 up. If I can get to the key, I can open the door. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make one of the walls into something else, like a passable object.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is. If I can make Baba into something else, like a key or a passable object, that might help me get through the walls.

I'm not sure which approach is better. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule first. Let me see where it is. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. If I move it to a different position, maybe I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I move it to where a wall is, I can change that wall into something else.

Wait, but moving rules requires that I can move them. Are the rules movable? I think in Baba Is You, rules are text blocks that can be moved if they're not defined as stop. So, I should check if the ""wall"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, it's probably movable unless it's defined as stop.

Looking back, I see a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. That might be preventing me from moving through certain areas. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position to make those areas passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition something else.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on getting the key first. To get the key, I need to reach it, but there are walls in the way. If I can make those walls passable, I can get to the key.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. But I'm not sure how. Maybe if I can make the ball into a tool that can destroy walls.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""ball"" rule to change its properties. If I can make the ball into a passable object, I can walk through it.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule to a position where it redefines a wall as something else. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to where a wall is, I can change that wall into a different object, like a passable block.

Let me try that. I'll move the ""wall"" rule to the position of one of the walls. That should change the wall into whatever the new rule defines. If I can make it into a passable object, I can move through it.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I need to move it step by step. Let me see where it is. It's at 1 step left and 4 up. I need to move it to a wall's position. Let's say I move it to the wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. That way, the wall there will be redefined based on the new rule.

Wait, but moving the rule will take time. Each move is a step, and I need to plan the path. Maybe I should move the ""wall"" rule down first, then to the right.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is pass,"" that would make all walls passable.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. I need to see if there's a ""pass"" rule or if I can create it by moving other rules.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ""you"" rule. It's at 1 step right and 1 down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to a different position, I can change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you"" into ""key,"" I can pick up the key without needing to move through walls.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to move the ""you"" rule next to a ""key"" rule to create a new rule like ""you is key."" That way, I can become the key and open the door.

Wait, that might work. Let me see where the ""key"" rule is. It's at 7 steps right and 3 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 down. I need to move the ""you"" rule to the position of the ""key"" rule. That way, I can create a new rule that makes me the key.

But moving the ""you"" rule that far might take too many steps, and I might get blocked by walls. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to where I am, so I can pick it up. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, there's a key object at 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move that key to where I am. But I can't move objects unless they're defined as movable. I need to check if the key is movable.

Looking back, I see the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. That might be preventing me from moving the key. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can make the key movable.

So, maybe I should first move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, making the key movable. Then, I can move the key to where I am, and use it to open the door.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's at 3 steps up. I need to move it step by step. Let me try moving it down first, then to the right or left.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule to a position where it no longer affects the key. That way, the key becomes movable.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different strategy. Let me think about the win condition. The win rule is at 9 steps right and 5 up. To get there, I need to go through the door, which requires the key.

So, my main goal is to get the key, then the door, then the win. But the walls are blocking my path. I need to find a way to make the walls passable or find a way around them.

Wait, there's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can make the ball into a tool that can destroy walls, I can clear a path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to change its properties. For example, if I make the ball into a ""break"" tool, it can destroy walls.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""ball"" rule to a wall's position, redefining that wall as a ball, which I can then move.

This is tricky. I'm not sure which approach is best. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule first to see if I can make a wall passable.

Let me try that. I'll move the ""wall"" rule to the position of a wall that's blocking my path. That should change that wall into something else, maybe a passable object.

But I need to plan the moves carefully. Each move is a step, and I don't want to get stuck.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is pass,"" that would make all walls passable.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to see if there's a ""pass"" rule or if I can create it by moving other rules.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but that's the opposite of what I want.

Hmm, maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the key so I can move the key.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. Identify the win condition: reach the ""win"" object at 9 right, 5 up.
2. To get there, I need to go through the door at 5 right, 3 up.
3. The door requires a key at 7 right, 3 up.
4. To get the key, I need to reach it, but walls are blocking the way.

So, my main obstacle is the walls between me and the key. I need to find a way to make those walls passable or find a way around them.

Looking at the rules, I see ""wall"" is defined as a rule. Maybe I can redefine what a wall is by moving the ""wall"" rule.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, I can change the properties of walls. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to where a wall is, I can redefine that wall as something else, like a passable block.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, I can make them passable.

But I'm not sure how to move the ""stop"" rule. It's at 3 steps up, so I need to move it step by step.

Maybe I should try moving the ""stop"" rule down first, then to the right or left, so it no longer affects the walls.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls might become passable, allowing me to reach the key.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule to a position where it redefines a wall as something else, like a passable block.

I think moving the ""stop"" rule might be the key here. Let me try that.

First, I need to move the ""stop"" rule down. It's at 3 steps up, so moving it down would take it to 2 steps up, then 1, etc.

But I need to plan the path. Each move is a step, and I don't want to get stuck.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I move it down to 2 steps up, it might still affect some walls. Maybe I should move it further down.

Alternatively, I could move it to the right or left to a position where it no longer blocks the key.

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ""you"" rule again.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 down. If I can move it to a different position, I can change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you"" into ""key,"" I can pick up the key without needing to move through walls.

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? I need to move it step by step to where the ""key"" rule is.

The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. That's a long way. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""key"" rule to where I am, so I can pick it up.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. I need to see if the ""key"" rule is movable.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move it to where I am, I can create a new rule like ""key is you,"" making me the key.

But moving the ""key"" rule that far might take too many steps, and I might get blocked by walls.

Hmm, this is tough. Maybe I should try to move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall passable.

Let me try that. I'll move the ""wall"" rule to the position of a wall that's blocking my path. That should change that wall into something else, maybe a passable block.

But I need to plan the moves carefully. Each move is a step, and I don't want to get stuck.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but that's the opposite of what I want.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule to a different position and see what happens.

Let me try moving the ""wall"" rule to the right. It's at 1 step left and 4 up. If I move it right, it will go to 0 steps left, then 1 right, etc.

But I'm not sure if that will help. Maybe I should move it down first.

Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule down, it will go to 3 up, then 2, etc. Maybe that will redefine some walls as passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule to where the ""stop"" rule is, combining them to create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, there's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can make the ball into a tool that can destroy walls, I can clear a path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule to change its properties.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ball itself if it's movable. But I need to check if it's defined as stop.

Looking back, I see the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. That might be preventing me from moving the ball.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can make the ball movable.

So, maybe I should first move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, making the ball movable. Then, I can move the ball to break through walls.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's at 3 steps up. I need to move it step by step.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule down first. That way, it's no longer affecting the ball.

Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the ball becomes movable. Then, I can move the ball to break through walls.

But I'm not sure if the ball can break walls. Maybe I need to create a rule that makes the ball able to destroy walls.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ball to a wall's position, redefining that wall as a ball, which I can then move.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall passable.

Let me try that. I'll move the ""wall"" rule to the position of a wall that's blocking my path. That should change that wall into something else, maybe a passable block.

But I need to plan the moves carefully. Each move is a step, and I don't want to get stuck.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes walls passable.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a wall, I can make that wall stop me, but that's the opposite of what I want.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule to a different position and see what happens.

Let me try moving the ""wall"" rule to the right. It's at 1 step left and 4 up. If I move it right, it will go to 0 steps left, then 1 right, etc.

But I'm not sure if that will help. Maybe I should move it down first.

Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule down, it will go to 3 up, then 2, etc. Maybe that will redefine some walls as passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""wall"" rule to where the ""stop"" rule is, combining them to create a new rule.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball, walls, and some rules like ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""key."" The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I should check if there are any obstacles. There are walls all around, but maybe I can move some rules to change the environment. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, which might be blocking something. If I can move that, maybe I can create a path.

I also see a ""key"" rule 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe that's needed to open a door. The ""door"" rule is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, perhaps I need to get the key to open the door and proceed further.

But wait, I'm Baba, and I can only move through objects that aren't ""stop"" or ""wall."" So, I need to see if I can move any rules to clear a path. The ""is"" rule is 4 steps up, which might be part of another rule. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule.

I also notice the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe moving that could change what Baba is. But I'm already ""you,"" so maybe that's not necessary right now.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the ""win"" rule, which is far to the right and up. There are walls in the way, so I might need to break through them by moving the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can make a wall disappear or appear somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""key"" and ""door"" rules to unlock a path. The key is 7 steps right and 3 up, and the door is 5 steps right and 3 up. If I can get the key, I can open the door and proceed.

But how do I get to the key? There are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to allow me to pass. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I move it, perhaps I can create a path.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move rules by moving into them. Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. If I move it down, maybe I can clear the path. But I need to see where I can move it without blocking myself.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. To get the key, I need to move right and up. But the walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to the side. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 4 up. If I move it further left, maybe I can create a gap.

Wait, if I move the ""wall"" rule to the left, the actual wall might disappear or move, creating a path. Let me try that. I'll move left to get to the ""wall"" rule and then move it further left.

But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me see the exact positions. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 4 up from me. So, I need to move up four times and then left once to reach it. But there are walls in the way, so I can't move up that much.

Maybe I should look for another approach. The ""key"" is 7 steps right and 3 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can find a shorter path or a way to bypass the walls.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, it might break it. But I'm not sure if that's possible here.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule, so that might not work.

Let me try to move the ""stop"" rule. It's 3 steps up. If I move it down, maybe I can clear a path. I'll move up three times to reach it and then move it down. That might allow me to pass through where the ""stop"" was.

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try to move the ""door"" rule instead. The ""door"" is 5 steps right and 3 up. If I can move it, maybe I can create an opening.

Wait, the ""key"" is 7 steps right and 3 up. If I can get the key, I can open the door. So, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. But how?

I'm stuck because the walls are blocking my path. Maybe I need to find a way to move the walls. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move that rule, maybe the actual wall will move, creating a path.

Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule. I'll move up four times and then left once to reach it. But there are walls in the way, so I can't move up that much. Maybe I can find another way to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule that helps me.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 4 steps up. If I move it to the right, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is something."" But I'm not sure what that something would be.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try moving the ""you"" rule. It's 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what ""you"" is, but I'm already ""baba is you,"" so that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule. It's 1 step left and 1 step down. If I move it, maybe I can change my properties.

Wait, if I move the ""baba"" rule to a different position, maybe I can make Baba have a new property. For example, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule, so that might not work.

Hmm, maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule. It's 9 steps right and 5 up. If I can move it closer, I can reach it easier. But that's a long way, and I don't know if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then getting the key would win the level. That might be a way to bypass the long path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to find a way to move the ""win"" rule or create a new one.

Wait, the ""key"" is 7 steps right and 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to open the door and reach the win rule. But I'm blocked by walls.

Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to a different position. It's 5 steps right and 3 up. If I can move it, maybe I can create an opening.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to allow me to pass through. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I move it down, maybe I can go through where it was.

I think I'll try moving the ""stop"" rule. I'll move up three times to reach it and then move it down. That might clear a path for me to move further up.

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try something else.

Wait, the ""ball"" is 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can push the ball to break through a wall. If I can move the ball into a wall, it might break it, creating a path.

But I'm not sure how to do that. I need to get to the ball first, but the walls are blocking me.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at all the rules again.

Active rules: baba is you.

Objects: walls, ball, rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key.""

I need to reach the ""win"" rule. To do that, I might need to open the door with the key. So, my plan is:

1. Get the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Proceed to the win rule.

But to get the key, I need to move right and up, but walls are blocking me. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to create a path.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move it further left, maybe the wall will disappear or move, creating a gap.

So, I'll try to move the ""wall"" rule. I'll move up four times and then left once to reach it. But there are walls in the way, so I can't move up that much. Maybe I can find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's 4 steps up. If I can move it to the right, maybe I can create a new rule that helps me pass through walls.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is pass,"" I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the right and combine it with another rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule. It's 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move it, maybe I can change my properties.

Wait, if I can make ""you is pass,"" then since I'm Baba and Baba is you, I can pass through walls. That might work.

So, I'll try to move the ""you"" rule. It's 1 step right and 1 step down. I'll move right once and down once to reach it. Then, I'll move it to the right to create a new rule like ""you is pass.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me try.

I'll move right once and down once to get to the ""you"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the right. That should create a new rule ""you is pass,"" allowing me to pass through walls.

Once I have that, I can move through the walls and reach the key and door.

So, my steps are:

1. Move right once.
2. Move down once to reach the ""you"" rule.
3. Move right once to create ""you is pass.""
4. Now, I can pass through walls.
5. Move up and right to reach the key.
6. Use the key to open the door.
7. Proceed to the win rule.

I think that's a good plan. Let's try it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That seems pretty far, but maybe I can manipulate the rules to make it easier. There's also a ""key"" object one step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door. Doors are typically locked and require a key to pass through, so that could be a path to the win.

I notice there are several walls and other rules scattered around. The walls are placed in a way that might block my path, but maybe I can move some rules to change their properties. For example, if I can move a ""stop"" rule next to a wall, it might make the wall passable or change its behavior.

The ball is four steps up, which might be a distraction or part of a puzzle. I'm not sure yet. The ""door"" rule is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" is nearby. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door and proceed towards the win.

I also see that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which are essential for creating new rules. Maybe I can rearrange these to create a new rule that helps me bypass obstacles or change the win condition.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm trying to reach the win, I probably need to move towards it. But the win is quite far, so maybe I should first collect the key to open the door.

The key is one step to the left. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, which is four steps to the right and three steps up. After opening the door, I can proceed further towards the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules together. For example, if I can place ""baba is win,"" that would make me the win condition, so I could win immediately. But I need to check if that's possible with the current setup.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and one step down, and a ""you"" rule one step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I might be able to create a new rule that changes the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe it's simpler to collect the key, open the door, and proceed to the win. Let me try moving left to get the key first.

Wait, if I move left, I might be moving away from the win. Maybe I should move up towards the door and key area. Let me see the layout again.

The door is at 4 steps right and 3 up, and the key is one step left. So if I move right four times and up three times, I can reach the door, but I need the key first. So I should first move left to get the key, then go back right and up to the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to get closer to the door and key. Let me try moving up to see if that helps.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the exact positions. Maybe I should try moving right to get closer to the door and key area. Let me try moving right once.

Wait, the key is one step to the left, so if I move left, I can get the key. Then, with the key, I can go to the door. Let me try that.

So, my plan is: move left to get the key, then move right and up to the door, open it, and proceed towards the win.

But I need to make sure that moving left is possible without hitting any walls. Let me check the walls. There's a wall three steps to the right and five up, but I'm not sure how that affects my path.

I think moving left is the way to go to get the key. So, I'll choose the left action.

But wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. I need to make sure I don't hit that because it might block me. Also, there are several walls around, so I have to navigate carefully.

I see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow, but I'm not sure yet. There's also a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step down, an ""is"" rule 1 step down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. These might be useful for changing rules.

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or something. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" that might help me avoid the stop rule. Or maybe I can make ""baba is key"" to pick up the key without needing to move there.

Wait, the key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can get to the key, I can open the door. But the door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, so I need to get past the door to reach the win. But there are walls in the way, so maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can bring the ""win"" rule down to where I am, I can just step on it. But how? I need to manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to move towards the key. But I'm currently at the starting position. Let me check the layout again.

The walls are positioned in a way that might form a corridor. I need to move right and up to get to the key. But I have to avoid the stop rule. Maybe I can move up first to bypass the stop.

Wait, the stop rule is 3 steps up. If I move up 3 steps, I'll hit the stop. So maybe I should move right first to avoid it. Let me try moving right a few steps to get around the stop.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to change the rules first. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key without moving all the way there. Let me see how to do that.

I need to move the ""key"" rule next to Baba. The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where Baba is and then move the ""key"" rule next to it. But that would require a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""key"" rules together. If I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key. But I'm not sure how to do that without moving the key rule closer.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where Baba is and then move the ""key"" rule next to it. Let me try that.

First, I need to move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step down next to Baba. Then, I can move the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is key."" But I'm not sure if that's possible because the key rule is far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to where the key is. But that might not help.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving towards the key and see if I can get past the door. Let me try moving right a few steps to get closer to the key.

Wait, the door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can get the key, I can open the door. But I need to get to the key first. Let me try moving right and up towards the key.

But I have to be careful not to hit the stop rule. Maybe I can move up first to bypass it. Let me try moving up 2 steps to avoid the stop rule, then move right towards the key.

After moving up 2 steps, I'm at a position where I can move right towards the key. Let me move right 4 steps to get closer. Now I'm near the key. But there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can change the rule to make the wall passable.

Wait, there's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule to make ""wall is stop,"" then I can pass through the walls. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make ""wall is stop,"" which would mean walls block movement. But that's the default, so maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to walk through walls. Let me see how to do that.

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""you"" rule next to it. That would create ""wall is you,"" meaning walls are passable. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is wall,"" which would turn me into a wall, but that might not help.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can bring the ""win"" rule down to where I am, I can just step on it.

The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule and then move the ""you"" rule next to it to make ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition wherever I am. But that might not work.

Wait, if I make ""win is you,"" then wherever I am becomes the win condition. So I can just step on any tile, and it would be the win. That could be a way to win without moving far.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule and then move the ""you"" rule next to it. But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer first.

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that next to the ""is"" rule, I can create a new rule. Let me try that.

First, I'll move the ""you"" rule up 1 step to get it next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. But that would require a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is and then move the ""win"" rule next to it. But that's also a lot of steps.

This is taking too long. Maybe I should try to move towards the key and see if I can get past the door. Let me try moving right and up towards the key.

After moving right 4 steps and up 3 steps, I'm near the key. But there's a wall blocking me. Maybe I can change the rule to make the wall passable.

Wait, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then I can't pass through walls. That's the opposite of what I want. Maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to walk through walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and then move the ""you"" rule next to it. Let me try that.

First, I'll move the ""is"" rule down 1 step to get it next to the ""wall"" rule. Then, I'll move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule to create ""wall is you."" Now, walls are passable.

Great, now I can walk through walls. Let me move towards the key, passing through the walls. Once I have the key, I can open the door and reach the win.

Wait, but I'm not sure if ""wall is you"" actually works. Maybe I should test it by moving into a wall. If I can pass through, then it's working.

Let me try moving into a wall. If I can pass through, then I can proceed. If not, I'll have to try a different approach.

Assuming it works, I'll move right and up towards the key, passing through any walls in the way. Once I reach the key, I can pick it up and then open the door.

After getting the key, I'll move towards the door. Since the door requires a key, I can now open it and proceed to the win.

Finally, I'll step on the win object to complete the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps right and 5 up. Then there are several rules: ""is"" at 7 right and 5 up, ""win"" at 8 right and 5 up, ""wall"" at 2 left and 4 up, another ""is"" at 1 left and 4 up, a ball at 4 up, and so on. There's a key 1 step to the left and a wall 3 steps right. The rules also include ""baba"" at 2 left and 1 down, ""is"" at 1 left and 1 down, and ""you"" at 1 down.

Hmm, so the key is 1 step to the left. I need to get that key to open the door, which is at 4 right and 3 up. But to get to the key, I might need to move left. However, I'm currently at a position where moving left might take me towards the wall or other objects.

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is at 2 left and 4 up. That probably means that walls are stoppable, so I can't move through them. I need to find a way to move towards the key without hitting a wall.

Let me visualize the map. Starting from my position, which is where Baba is. The key is 1 step to the left, so I can try moving left. But I need to check if there's a wall blocking me. The wall is 3 steps right and 1 step down, so maybe I have a clear path to the left.

If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door at 4 right and 3 up. But to get there, I might need to move right past some walls. Maybe I can break a rule to make the walls passable, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move up to reach the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" is at 8 right and 5 up. That's quite far. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks together to change the win condition.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 7 right and 5 up, and ""win"" is next to it. If I can move the ""is"" block to connect with ""win,"" maybe I can form a new rule like ""something is win,"" which could change what counts as winning.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's simpler to just collect the key and open the door. Let me try moving left to get the key first.

So, the action I should take is to move left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps right and 5 up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" at 1 step left, which might be useful for opening a door. The door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 7 right and 3 up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door.

But wait, there are walls all around. The walls are at various positions, and some rules like ""stop"" are present. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, which might mean that if I move into that area, I can't move further. I need to be careful about that.

I also see a ""ball"" at 1 right and 4 up. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be pushed, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 4 up, which might be part of another rule I can create or modify.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 1 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right and 1 down. Maybe I can move these to change the rules. For example, if I can move ""you"" to another position, I might change what ""you"" is, which could help me move differently.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make myself (Baba) able to move through walls or bypass the stop rule. If I can change the ""you"" rule, maybe I can become something else that can pass through walls or move in a different way.

Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules closer to each other. If I can make ""win"" be something else, like ""key is win,"" then getting the key would win the level.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to move towards the key. The key is at 1 left, so I should move left. But I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably near the bottom. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so I need to navigate around them.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 5 up, 4 right and 4 up, etc. So the path to the key might be blocked by walls. Maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls.

I see that the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move up 3 steps, I might hit the stop and can't move further. So I need to go around that. Maybe I can move right a bit first to avoid the stop.

Alternatively, if I can change the ""stop"" rule by moving it, I might be able to pass through. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Let me try moving up first. If I move up, I can get closer to the key without hitting the stop. Then, I can move left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it to reach the win.

But wait, the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So after getting the key, I need to move right to the door. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through the walls by changing the rules.

Alternatively, if I can make myself into a ""key,"" then I can open the door without needing the actual key. That might be a better approach.

To do that, I need to create a new rule like ""baba is key."" But how? I have the ""is"" rule at 8 right and 5 up, and ""key"" at 7 right and 3 up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" and ""key"" closer to Baba to create the new rule.

But moving those rules might require me to move through walls, which I can't do yet. So perhaps I need to first change the ""you"" rule to something else to allow me to move through walls.

If I can make ""you is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. Alternatively, I can make ""you is push"" to push walls aside.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can push the ball to break through walls. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""you"" rule down to make myself something else. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I move it to a different position, maybe I can change what ""you"" is.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. I think I can only move text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So I need to check if the rules are movable.

In this case, the rules are text blocks, so I can move them. So I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules to create new combinations.

Let me try to move the ""is"" rule at 4 up closer to the ""you"" rule. If I can place ""you"" next to ""is,"" I can create a new rule like ""you is something.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should first try to get the key and see if that helps. The key is at 1 left, so I can move left to get it. Then, with the key, I can open the door at 5 right and 3 up.

But the door is behind walls. So I need to find a path to the door. Maybe I can go up, then right, avoiding the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule and the ""pass"" rule together. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule here. So maybe that's not possible.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by combining existing ones. If I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""pass,"" I can make ""wall is pass."" But I don't have a ""pass"" rule, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that would make walls stop me, which is the default behavior.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the positions again.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's the far right. The ""key"" is at 1 left, so I need to go left to get it. Then, I can go right to the door and open it to reach the win.

But the path to the door is blocked by walls. So I need to find a way to get past the walls. Maybe I can go up first, then right, then down to the door.

Let me try to move up. I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably at the bottom. Moving up 5 steps would take me to the top, but there are walls there. Alternatively, moving up 3 steps to avoid the stop rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. So if I move up 3 steps, I'll hit the stop and can't move further. So I need to move up 2 steps instead, then move right or left.

Alternatively, I can move right first to avoid the stop. Let me try moving right to 4 steps, then up.

But the walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So moving right 4 steps would take me into a wall. I can't do that.

Maybe I can move right 1 step, then up. Let's see. Moving right 1 step, then up 4 steps. But there's a wall at 4 right and 4 up. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, moving right 1 step, then up 3 steps. There's a wall at 4 right and 3 up, but I'm only moving to 1 right and 3 up, which is clear.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, 1 left. So if I'm at 1 right and 3 up, I'm not hitting the stop. So that's safe.

From there, I can move right to 4 steps, but that's blocked by a wall. So maybe I can move up further.

Alternatively, I can move left from 1 right and 3 up to get to the key at 1 left. But that would require moving left 2 steps, which might be blocked by walls.

Wait, the key is at 1 left, so I need to move left from my current position. But I'm at 1 right, so moving left 2 steps would take me to 1 left, where the key is.

But are there walls blocking that path? Let me check. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, but moving left from 1 right shouldn't hit any walls.

So, I can move left 2 steps to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door at 5 right and 3 up.

But the door is at 5 right and 3 up, which is behind walls. So I need to find a way to get there.

Wait, the door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 1 left. So after getting the key, I need to move right 6 steps to reach the door. But there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to open the door from a distance, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to win without going through the door. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then having the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, and the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So I need to move the ""key"" rule up to meet the ""win"" rule.

But moving rules requires me to move them, which I can do since they're text blocks. So I can move the ""key"" rule up 2 steps to 5 up, then right 2 steps to 9 right. Then, the ""key"" rule would be next to the ""win"" rule, creating ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to meet the ""key"" rule.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I move it down to 3 up, it would be at 9 right and 3 up. Then, the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So I can move the ""win"" rule left 2 steps to 7 right and 3 up, making ""win is key.""

But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to create the rule. Maybe I need to have ""key is win"" instead.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule between ""key"" and ""win"" to create ""key is win.""

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me think again. I need to get the key, then go to the door, then reach the win. But the path is blocked by walls. So perhaps I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

If I can make ""wall is pass,"" then I can walk through them. But I don't have a ""pass"" rule. Alternatively, I can make ""wall is you,"" which would make the walls part of me, but that might not help.

Wait, if I can make ""you is wall,"" then I would become a wall, which might allow me to push other walls or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can make ""you is key,"" which would allow me to open the door without needing the key. That might be a better approach.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So I need to move the ""key"" rule down to meet the ""you"" rule.

But moving the ""key"" rule down would require me to move it past other rules, which might not be possible due to walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" rule up to meet the ""key"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I move it up 4 steps, it would be at 1 right and 3 up, which is where the ""key"" rule is. Then, placing ""you"" next to ""key"" would create ""you is key.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. Maybe I need to have ""is"" between them.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to between ""you"" and ""key,"" I can create ""you is key.""

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule from 8 right and 5 up to 1 right and 3 up, which is a long distance and might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" rule to 7 right and 3 up, where the ""key"" rule is, and then place the ""is"" rule in between.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me try to get the key first. I'll move left 2 steps to get the key. Then, I can see if I can use it to open the door.

After getting the key, I need to go to the door at 5 right and 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls. So I need to find a way to get past them.

Wait, the door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 1 left. So I need to move right 6 steps from the key's position to reach the door. But there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to open the door from a distance. But I'm not sure if that's possible in Baba Is You.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule that allows me to win without going through the door. For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then having the key would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, and the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So I can move the ""key"" rule up 2 steps to 5 up, then right 2 steps to 9 right. Then, placing ""key"" next to ""win"" would create ""key is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to create the rule. Maybe I need to have ""is"" between them.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule down to meet the ""key"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I move it down to 3 up, it would be at 9 right and 3 up. Then, the ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So I can move the ""win"" rule left 2 steps to 7 right and 3 up, making ""win is key.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try to get the key and see if that helps.

So, I'll move left 2 steps to get the key. Now, I have the key. Next, I need to go to the door at 5 right and 3 up.

But the door is behind walls. So I need to find a way to get past them. Maybe I can go up first, then right.

I'll move up 3 steps to avoid the stop rule, then right 4 steps to reach the door. But there's a wall at 4 right and 3 up. So I can't move right 4 steps.

Alternatively, I can move up 4 steps, but that's blocked by walls. So I'm stuck.

Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule and ""pass"" rule together, but I don't have a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's the default behavior.

Wait, maybe I can make ""you is push,"" which would allow me to push walls. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can make ""you is jump,"" but again, no ""jump"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you."" So I control Baba. The other rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" ""ball,"" etc.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change what ""you"" is. If I can make ""you is key,"" then I can open the door without needing the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 3 up. So I need to move the ""key"" rule down to meet the ""you"" rule.

But moving the ""key"" rule down would require me to move it past other rules, which might not be possible due to walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" rule up to meet the ""key"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I move it up 4 steps, it would be at 1 right and 3 up, which is where the ""key"" rule is. Then, placing ""you"" next to ""key"" would create ""you is key.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it. Maybe I need to have ""is"" between them.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to between ""you"" and ""key,"" I can create ""you is key.""

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule from 8 right and 5 up to 1 right and 3 up, which is a long distance and might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""you"" rule to 7 right and 3 up, where the ""key"" rule is, and then place the ""is"" rule","

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball, walls, and various rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" and others. The walls are positioned in a way that might block my path, but I can move around them if possible.

I see that the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far, so I need to figure out the best path to get there. There are also doors and keys, which suggests that I might need to collect a key to open a door to reach the win condition.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how yet.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""is"" rule next to another object, I can change the properties of that object.

The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can stop certain objects from moving or affecting me. But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

The ""door"" is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, the key is to the right of the door. I might need to collect the key first to open the door.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe I can move that to change what Baba is. But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I'm already controlling Baba, so maybe that's not necessary right now.

The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change who ""you"" is, but I'm not sure if that's useful here.

I think the key steps are to collect the key, open the door, and then proceed towards the win condition. But I need to figure out how to move through the walls and other obstacles.

Let me try to visualize the map. Starting from my position, I need to move right and up to reach the win. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I push the ball into a wall, perhaps it will destroy the wall, creating a path.

Alternatively, I can try to rearrange the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make a rule like ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but that's the opposite of what I want. Maybe I can make ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Wait, I see a ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, making ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but I don't want that. Maybe I can make ""stop is wall,"" which would mean that the stop rule becomes a wall, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I can move an ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can make ""ball is you,"" which would let me control the ball. Then I could use the ball to break through walls.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that are not defined as ""stop."" Since the ""is"" rule is just a text block, I can move it. So, I can pick up an ""is"" rule and place it next to the ball, creating ""ball is you."" Then, I can control the ball to push through walls.

Once I have control of the ball, I can move it into the walls to break them, creating a path towards the win. After that, I can collect the key, open the door, and proceed to the win condition.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Move towards an ""is"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule and place it next to the ball, creating ""ball is you.""
3. Control the ball to push through walls, clearing a path.
4. Collect the key.
5. Open the door.
6. Proceed to the win condition.

But wait, I'm currently controlling Baba. If I make the ball ""you,"" will I switch control to the ball? I think so. So, I need to make sure that after creating ""ball is you,"" I can switch control to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" rule. So, using the ball seems like the best option.

Let me try to move towards the ""is"" rule that's 4 steps up. I can move up four times to reach it. Then, I can pick it up and move it next to the ball, which is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So, after moving up four steps, I can move right one step to place the ""is"" rule next to the ball.

Once that's done, the ball becomes ""you,"" and I can control it. Then, I can move the ball into the walls to break them.

After breaking the walls, I can collect the key, which is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Then, I can open the door, which is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and proceed towards the win condition at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up.

I think this is a viable plan. So, my first move should be to move up four steps to reach the ""is"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then there are some rules: ""is"" at 8 right and 4 up, ""win"" at 9 right and 4 up, and ""wall"" at 1 left and 3 up. There's also another ""is"" rule at 3 up. A ball is at 1 right and 3 up. Walls are scattered around, and there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 up. Doors and keys are present too, with the key at 7 right and 2 up. A key is also at 1 step down. 

I notice that the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 2 down, ""is"" is at 2 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right and 2 down. There are walls around, so I need to be careful about movement.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules to change the game's behavior. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules.

I see a key at 1 step down. Maybe I can pick it up to open a door. But first, I need to get to the key. Let me check the path. From my current position, moving down might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, I can try moving right or left to find a way around.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a path. Or perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule to make a wall passable. 

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. Let me try moving down to pick up the key. If that's blocked, I'll have to find another way. Alternatively, I can try moving right to get closer to the ""win"" rule and see if I can change it.

Hmm, maybe I should move right to get near the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. That way, I can potentially create a new rule that helps me win without needing the key. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can just move to the win position.

But first, I need to get to the ""is"" rule. It's at 8 right and 4 up. That's quite far. Maybe I can move up first to get closer. Let me try moving up to see if that's possible.

Wait, moving up might take me into a wall. I need to check the map again. The wall is at 4 right and 4 up, so if I move up from my current position, I might hit a wall. Maybe I should move right instead.

Alternatively, I can try moving left to see if there's a way around. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up, so maybe I can move that to create a path. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can make a wall passable.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either change the win condition or make a path to the key. Since the key is at 1 step down, I'll try moving down first. If that's blocked, I'll have to find another way.

Wait, moving down might take me to the key. Let me try that. If I move down, I can pick up the key and then use it to open the door. Once the door is open, I can reach the ""win"" rule and change it to make myself the winner.

Alternatively, if moving down is blocked, I can try moving right to get to the ""is"" rule and create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can just move to the win position without needing the key.

I think the best first step is to move down to get the key. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I should note the positions of the rules. There's a ""wall"" rule 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. That probably means that any wall can be moved or has some property. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up, which is a bit confusing. There's also a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up, which might mean that something stops movement.

The ball is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. I wonder if the ball can be used to break through walls or something. The door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, to open the door, I probably need the key.

Wait, but how do I get the key? It's 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can move the rules around to change the properties of objects.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 1 step down, an ""is"" rule 1 step down, and a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can rearrange these to change what Baba is or what ""you"" means.

Let me think about the movement. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to figure out a path to the key and then to the door, and eventually to the win condition.

But there are a lot of walls in the way. Maybe I can use the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop me, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, if I can change the ""wall"" rule, maybe I can make walls passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I move that rule, maybe I can change what a wall is. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""something else,"" I could redefine walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a key or something else. If I can make Baba into a key, then I can open the door without needing the separate key.

Let me see. The key is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The door is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I can get to the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

But how do I get past the walls? Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being solid. Or perhaps I can redefine ""stop"" to mean something else.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I move it, maybe I can make it apply to something else. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule next to a wall, maybe that wall will stop me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I could make the ball into something else, like a key or a tool to break walls.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, I need to make sure that the rules I want to move aren't stopped.

Let me try to plan a path. I need to get to the key, which is 7 steps right and 3 up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make those walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to redefine the walls. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I can push the walls out of the way.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Hmm. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object.

Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can make the ball into a tool, maybe I can use it to break walls or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key, so I can open the door without needing the separate key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. I need to move Baba to the key, but walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make the walls into something else, like ""air"" or ""passable.""

If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""air,"" then walls would become passable. But I don't see an ""air"" rule here. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make the walls stop being solid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up. If I move it next to a wall, maybe that wall will stop me, but that doesn't help. I need to make the walls not stop me.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to redefine something else. For example, if I make ""stop is you,"" then maybe I can stop myself, but that doesn't seem helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to break apart the existing rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule away from ""baba is you,"" that might change the rules in a way that helps me.

But I'm not sure. I need to be careful because changing the rules can have unexpected effects.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down. If I move that, maybe I can change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you is key,"" then I can open the door without needing the separate key.

That sounds promising. Let me try that. I need to move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""key."" But the ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down, and the key is 7 steps right and 3 up. That's a long way. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""you."" But the key is an object, not a rule. Hmm.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is 7 steps right and 3 up. If I can move that rule next to ""you,"" then maybe ""you is key,"" which would let me open the door.

But moving the ""key"" rule that far might be difficult. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""you is key.""

Let me try to plan the steps. I need to move the ""you"" rule next to ""key"" or vice versa. But the distance is too far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule somewhere else.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps up. If I move it next to ""you,"" I can make ""you is something."" But I need to make ""you is key.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule next to ""you"" using the ""is"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move the ""you"" rule closer to the key. Let me see how many steps that would take.

The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down. The key is 7 right and 3 up. So, I need to move the ""you"" rule 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer. The ""key"" rule is 7 right and 3 up. If I can move it to the same position as ""you,"" that would make ""you is key.""

But moving the ""key"" rule that far might be blocked by walls. Let me check the walls.

There are walls at 4 right and various up positions. So, moving the ""key"" rule left would require moving through walls, which might not be possible unless I change the wall rules.

Hmm, this is a bit of a dead end. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's look at the door and key again.

The door is 5 right and 3 up, and the key is 7 right and 3 up. So, the key is two steps to the right of the door. If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead me closer to the win condition.

But to get the key, I need to move right 7 steps and up 3. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can move the walls out of the way by redefining them.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move that rule to make walls passable, that would help. For example, if I make ""wall is air,"" then walls would become passable.

But I don't see an ""air"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make walls stop being solid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 3 up. If I move it next to a wall, maybe that wall will stop me, but that's not helpful. I need to make walls not stop me.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to redefine something else. For example, if I make ""stop is push,"" then I can push walls.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Hmm.

This is getting a bit frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's see what other rules are present.

There's a ""ball"" at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. If I can make the ball into a tool, that might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key, so I can open the door without needing the separate key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. I need to move Baba to the key, but walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to make the walls passable.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There are also some rules scattered around. For example, there's a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win is pretty far to the right and up.

There's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe that's useful, but I'm not sure yet. There are walls all around, which might block my path. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up, which could mean that if I move into that area, I might get stopped.

I also see a door at 5 steps right and 3 up, and a key at 7 steps right and 3 up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door. But how do I get there? There are walls in the way, so I might need to break a rule or move some text blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down, ""is"" is 1 step down, and ""you"" is 1 step right and 1 step down. So maybe I can manipulate these rules to change my properties or the environment.

Wait, if I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules, I might be able to change what Baba is. For example, if I move ""you"" next to something else, maybe I can make that object ""you"" and control it instead. Or maybe I can make Baba into a different object to pass through walls.

I think the key is to get to the key, then use it to open the door, and then proceed towards the win. But the walls are blocking the way. Maybe I can break a wall by changing its rule. If I can make a wall into something else, like a ""stop,"" then it might not block me anymore.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""stop"" rule away so that I can pass through that area without being stopped. Let me see where the ""stop"" rule is. It's at 3 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a path.

I'm a bit confused about how to move the text blocks. I think I can only move them if they're not defined as ""stop"" or similar. So I need to find a way to move the necessary rules to create a new path or change the properties.

Maybe I should start by moving towards the ball. It's at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can get the ball, perhaps it can help me break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""baba"" rule to make Baba into something else. If I can make Baba into a ""key,"" then I can open the door without needing the actual key. That might be a way to bypass some obstacles.

Wait, the key is at 7 steps right and 3 up. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or jump over them. If I can make Baba into a ""jump"" or ""fly"" object, that would help.

But I don't see a ""jump"" or ""fly"" rule here. Hmm. Maybe I can combine existing rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win immediately. But I don't know if that's possible.

Let me try to visualize the map. There's a wall 4 right and 5 up, which is the top right area. The win is even further right. The door is at 5 right and 3 up, and the key is at 7 right and 3 up. So the key is to the right of the door. Maybe I need to go around the walls somehow.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key. But the walls are in the way. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location so that I can pass through. Or perhaps I can move a wall rule to make a path.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a non-wall area. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" to make ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. Then I could move the key to the door. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""baba"" rule down to make Baba into something else. If I can make Baba into a ""key,"" then I can open the door without needing to reach the key first.

Let me try that. If I move the ""baba"" rule down, maybe I can make it ""baba is key."" Then I can open the door. But I need to figure out how to move the rule.

Wait, I think I can only move text blocks, not the rules themselves. So I need to move the ""is"" or ""key"" blocks to create a new rule.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key"" could create a new rule. Maybe I can make ""baba is key"" by moving the ""is"" block between them.

But I'm not sure how to do that exactly. I think I need to move the ""is"" block to a position where it connects ""baba"" and ""key."" That way, the rule becomes ""baba is key,"" and I can control the key.

Alternatively, I could move the ""key"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to make ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key directly.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to either make Baba into a key or make the key into something I can control. Once I can control the key, I can open the door and proceed towards the win.

So, my plan is to move the ""is"" block to create a new rule that allows me to control the key. Once I have the key, I can open the door and reach the win.

I need to figure out the exact movements to achieve this. Let me try to move the ""is"" block towards the key. It's currently at 8 steps right and 5 up. I need to move it down to where the key is.

But moving it all the way down might take several steps. Maybe I can move it left or right to position it correctly.

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 8 right and 5 up. The key is at 7 right and 3 up. So I need to move the ""is"" block left by one step and down by two steps to get it next to the key.

But I can only move one step at a time. So I'll need to move left, then down, then left again, and so on until it's in the right position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" block up to meet the ""is"" block. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" block towards the key. Let me start by moving left from its current position.

So, the first move would be to move the ""is"" block left by one step. That would bring it to 7 right and 5 up. Then, I can move it down step by step until it's next to the key.

Once the ""is"" block is next to the key, I can create the rule ""key is you,"" which would let me control the key. Then, I can move the key to the door to open it.

After opening the door, I can proceed towards the win, which is at 9 right and 5 up. That's the ultimate goal.

I think this is the right approach. I'll start by moving the ""is"" block left to begin creating the new rule.

First, I notice there's a key 1 step to the right. Maybe I need to pick that up to open a door. The door is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and maybe access a path to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I can move around them if possible. Also, there are ""stop"" rules, which probably prevent me from moving through certain areas.

I see a ""stop"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That might be blocking the path to the door. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can create a path.

But how do I move rules? I can only move objects or text blocks that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So, I need to see if I can manipulate the rules to change the environment.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""baba is you"" rule, which I can't change because that's what defines me. But there are other rules like ""wall is stop"" or ""key is win"" that I might be able to rearrange.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the right. If I can move the key to the door, maybe I can unlock it. But the door is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. That's a bit far. Maybe I need to create a path by moving some walls or rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would end the level. That could be a shortcut.

To do that, I need to move the ""key"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's too far. Maybe I can bring the ""key"" closer.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think again. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I don't see an immediate use for it.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But I don't know if that's necessary.

Wait, the ""key"" is 1 step to the right. If I move right, I can pick it up. But is there a wall blocking me? Let me check the walls. There's a wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, but I'm starting at the origin, so moving right a few steps should be possible.

So, maybe the plan is: move right to pick up the key, then use it to open the door, and proceed towards the win.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. Let me visualize the map. The walls are at various positions, but if I move right, I can go around them. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up, which might block the way to the door. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down or somewhere else to clear the path.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""door"" rule closer, that would help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Another thought: the ""ball"" is 2 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break a wall or something, but I don't see a direct way.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 1 step down. If I can move that, maybe I can change my properties. But I'm not sure.

I think the most straightforward approach is to move right to get the key, then use it to open the door, and proceed towards the win. Let me try that.

So, first, I'll move right to pick up the key. Then, I'll move towards the door, using the key to open it. After that, I can navigate towards the win rule.

But I need to make sure I can move through the area. Let me check the walls again. There are walls at 5 steps right and various up positions, but if I move carefully, I can go around them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move some rules to create a clearer path. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule down to avoid blocking the way.

But for now, I'll proceed with moving right to get the key. That seems like the first logical step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also see a key that's 1 step to the right. Maybe I need the key to open a door or something.

The rules on the map include ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""key."" I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules, which might be useful for creating new rules by moving them around. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, which probably means that any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved.

I'm currently at a position where I can move around, but I need to figure out how to get to the win condition. The key is nearby, so maybe I should pick that up first. If I can get the key, I might be able to open a door that's blocking my path to the win.

Let me plan my steps. I need to move right to get the key. Once I have the key, I can look for the door, which is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can open the door, maybe I can proceed further towards the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. I need to make sure I can move through them. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have a ""stop"" property. I should check if the walls have any rules attached. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, so maybe those walls are just regular walls without any special properties.

I think the best course of action is to move right to pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go towards the door. After opening the door, I can move towards the win condition. Let me try moving right first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 3 steps right and 5 up. Then there are some rules: ""is"" at 7 right and 5 up, ""win"" at 8 right and 5 up. There's also a ""wall"" rule 2 left and 4 up, and another ""is"" rule 1 left and 4 up. A ball is at 4 up. Walls are scattered around, and there's a ""stop"" rule 1 left and 3 up. Doors and keys are present too, with the key at 6 right and 3 up, and another key 1 left. There's a ""baba"" rule 2 left and 1 down, an ""is"" rule 1 left and 1 down, and a ""you"" rule 1 down. Also, walls are all over the place.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The win condition is at 9 right and 5 up, so I need to get there. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can change the rules to make the walls passable or remove them.

I see a ""stop"" rule, which probably makes objects stop movement. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that changes the properties of the walls.

Looking at the key and door, maybe I need to unlock a path. The key is at 6 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. If I can get the key, I might be able to open the door. But to get the key, I need to move right, but there are walls in the way.

Wait, the ball is at 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through walls if I can make it move. But I'm not sure how. Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules to create new rules that help me.

I think the best approach is to move towards the key first. Let me try to move right to get closer to the key. But there's a wall in the way. Maybe I can move up or down to find a path.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is. If I can make Baba into something else, like a key or a door, that might help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I think I'll try to move right to get closer to the key. Let me see if that's possible without hitting a wall. If I move right, there's a wall at 4 right and 5 up, so I can't go that way. Maybe I need to move up first to get around.

Alternatively, I can move down to see if there's a path. But moving down might take me away from the key. Hmm.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. Let me try to move towards the ""stop"" rule.

I need to move left to get to the ""stop"" rule. Let me try moving left once. That should get me closer to the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, I might be able to change how walls behave.

So, I think the best action is to move left to get closer to the ""stop"" rule and see if I can manipulate it to help me progress.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the left, which might be useful for opening a door. The ""door"" is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. Walls are at various positions, like 4 steps right and 5 up, 4 right and 4 up, etc. I need to navigate around them. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up, which might block movement if I'm not careful.

I see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break through something or change the rules. There's also a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up, which might be part of another rule I can manipulate.

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move these to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba.

But first, I need to get to the key. It's 1 step to the left, so I should move left. But I'm currently at the starting position, so moving left might not be possible if there's a wall. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, but I'm not sure about the left side. If I can move left, I can pick up the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get around the walls. The ""win"" is up high, so I might need to go up first. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can break through them by manipulating the rules.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that, I can prevent it from stopping me. Or maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change what ""stop"" does.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to plan step by step. First, I need to get the key to open the door. So, I should move towards the key. It's 1 step to the left, so I'll try to move left. If that's blocked, I'll have to find another way.

If moving left is blocked, maybe I can go up first, then left. Let me see the walls. There's a wall 4 steps right and 5 up, but I'm not sure about the left side. Maybe I can move up a few steps, then left.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties of the walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push,"" I can push them out of the way. But I'm not sure how to do that right now.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. If I can get near it, I can combine it with another rule to change something.

I think the best first move is to try to get the key. So, I'll move left. If that's blocked, I'll adjust my plan. Let's try moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 5 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's probably blocking something. Then there are several rules scattered around. The rule ""is"" is at 9 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" is at 10 right and 5 up. So, the win condition is pretty far to the right and up.

There's a ball at 2 right and 4 up. Balls in Baba Is You can be pushed, so maybe that's useful. There's also a key at 1 step to the right. Keys usually open doors, so I should look for a door. Indeed, there's a door at 6 right and 3 up, and a key at 8 right and 3 up. So, I might need to get the key to open the door.

The rules ""stop"" is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can move that, maybe I can change the behavior of something. The ""wall"" rule is at 4 up, which might mean walls are stoppable or something else.

I also see that there's a ""baba"" rule at 1 step down, ""is"" at 1 step down, and ""you"" at 2 right and 1 down. Maybe I can rearrange these to change the rules.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The key is at 1 step to the right, so I can pick that up. Then, I can go to the door at 6 right and 3 up. But to get there, I might need to move some walls or rules.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, maybe I can make walls passable. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""is not,"" then walls wouldn't stop me. But I don't see a ""not"" rule here.

Alternatively, I can try to push the ball to break through walls. The ball is at 2 right and 4 up. If I move Baba next to the ball, I can push it. Maybe pushing the ball into a wall will break it, allowing me to pass.

Let me plan the steps:

1. Move right to pick up the key at 1 step right.
2. Then, move towards the door at 6 right and 3 up.
3. If the door is locked, use the key to open it.
4. Once through the door, proceed towards the win condition at 10 right and 5 up.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can bring ""win"" next to me, I can win without moving far. But that might require moving the ""win"" rule, which is at 10 right and 5 up.

Another idea: if I can make Baba into a different object, like a key or a ball, I might have more abilities. For example, if I can make Baba into a key, I can open doors without needing the separate key.

Looking at the rules, I can try to create a new rule by moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and another property. For example, if I move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""key,"" then ""baba is key,"" which would make me a key, allowing me to open doors directly.

So, steps:

1. Move to the ""baba"" rule at 1 step down.
2. Move it next to ""is"" and ""key"" to create ""baba is key.""
3. Now, as a key, I can open doors without needing the separate key.
4. Proceed to the door, open it, and reach the win condition.

But I need to check if I can move the ""baba"" rule. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but can I move the rule itself? In Baba Is You, rules are made of blocks that can be moved if they're not defined as stop. So, if ""rule `baba`"" is movable, I can rearrange it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""key"" to form the new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up, and ""key"" is at 8 right and 3 up. That's a bit far. Maybe it's easier to move ""baba"" to where ""is"" and ""key"" are.

But that might take too many steps. Maybe there's a quicker way.

Another approach: use the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, it might break the wall, creating a path.

So, steps:

1. Move right to the ball at 2 right and 4 up.
2. Push the ball into a wall, breaking it.
3. Use the cleared path to reach the key and door.
4. Open the door and proceed to the win condition.

But I need to make sure the ball can be pushed into a wall. Let me check the positions. The ball is at 2 right and 4 up. The walls are at 5 right and 5 up, 5 right and 4 up, etc. So, pushing the ball right might hit a wall.

Alternatively, I can move the ball up or down to break a wall.

Wait, the ball is at 2 right and 4 up. If I move up, I can push the ball up to 2 right and 5 up, which is a wall. That might break the wall, allowing me to pass.

So, plan:

1. Move right twice to reach the ball.
2. Push the ball up to break the wall at 2 right and 5 up.
3. Now, I can move up through the broken wall.
4. Proceed towards the key and door.

But I'm not sure if pushing the ball into the wall will break it. In Baba Is You, usually, you need to have a rule that allows breaking walls, like ""wall is break.""

Looking at the rules, I don't see ""wall is break,"" but I can try to create it by moving the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""break.""

The ""wall"" rule is at 4 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up, and ""break"" isn't present. Hmm, maybe I can create ""wall is stop"" or something else.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop movement, but that's probably already the case.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to have ""not"" in the rules, but I don't see it here.

Maybe I need to find another way. Let's think about the win condition. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right and 5 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can win without moving far.

So, steps:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at 10 right and 5 up.
2. Move it next to ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition, allowing me to win immediately.

But that seems too far. I need to get there, but walls are blocking the way.

Alternatively, I can try to create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I am, I win.

So, steps:

1. Move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
2. Now, as Baba, I am the win condition, so I win.

But where are the rules? The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step down, ""is"" is at 8 right and 5 up, and ""win"" is at 9 right and 5 up. That's a long way to move the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""baba."" But again, that's a lot of steps.

Maybe it's easier to focus on getting the key and opening the door. Let's see:

1. Move right to pick up the key at 1 step right.
2. Then, move towards the door at 6 right and 3 up.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed through the door towards the win condition.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. There are walls at 5 right and 3 up, so I might need to break them or find another way.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block movement.

To do that, I need to have ""not"" in the rules, but I don't see it. Alternatively, I can try to remove the ""stop"" property from walls.

But without ""not,"" it's tricky. Maybe I can just move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""nothing"" to make ""wall is nothing,"" which would remove walls. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see the positions again.

I'm at the starting point, and the key is at 1 right. The door is at 6 right and 3 up. The win is at 10 right and 5 up.

If I can get the key, open the door, and proceed, that might work. But the walls are in the way.

Wait, the ball is at 2 right and 4 up. If I can push the ball to break a wall, I can create a path.

So, steps:

1. Move right to the ball at 2 right and 4 up.
2. Push the ball up to break the wall at 2 right and 5 up.
3. Now, I can move up through the broken wall.
4. Proceed to the key, then to the door, and then to the win.

But I'm not sure if pushing the ball into the wall will break it. Maybe I need to create a rule that allows walls to be broken.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""break"" to make ""wall is break,"" but I don't see a ""break"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's probably already the case. Maybe I can make ""wall is not stop"" by moving ""not"" next to it, but I don't have ""not.""

This is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can make ""baba is win,"" I can win immediately.

So, steps:

1. Move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
2. Now, I am the win condition, so I win.

But the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step down, and ""is"" and ""win"" are far away. It might take too many steps.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""win is you,"" which would make me the win condition.

But again, moving the ""win"" rule that far is difficult.

Maybe I should focus on the key and door. Let's try:

1. Move right to pick up the key at 1 step right.
2. Then, move up to 3 up, right to 6 right to reach the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Proceed through the door and towards the win.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. There are walls at 5 right and 3 up, so I might need to break them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe the walls won't stop me.

So, steps:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 1 right and 3 up.
2. Move it somewhere else, like down or left.
3. Now, walls might not stop me, allowing me to pass through.

But I'm not sure if that works. In Baba Is You, rules define properties, so moving ""stop"" might change what stops movement.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""not stop"" to make walls not stop me. But without ""not,"" it's hard.

Maybe I can just try moving through the walls after moving the ""stop"" rule. Let's attempt:

1. Move right to 1 right, then up to 3 up to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down to 3 down.
3. Now, walls might not stop me, so I can move through them.

Then, proceed to the key, door, and win.

But I'm not sure if this will work. It's worth a try.

Alternatively, I can try to push the ball into a wall to break it, creating a path.

So, steps:

1. Move right to 2 right, up to 4 up to reach the ball.
2. Push the ball up to 2 right and 5 up, breaking the wall.
3. Now, move up through the broken wall.
4. Proceed to the key, door, and win.

This seems more straightforward. Let's go with this plan.

So, the first step is to move right to reach the ball.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps right and 3 up, and a door at 5 right and 3 up. So maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, some to the right and up. I need to figure out a path that isn't blocked by walls. Let me visualize the map.

Starting from Baba's position, which is probably near the bottom left since the rules mention moving right and up. The walls are at 4 right and 5 up, which is where the win rule is. So the win is behind a wall. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I can move the wall or change the rules to make the wall passable.

Looking at the rules, I see ""rule `stop` 3 step up."" That probably means that the stop rule is at 3 up, which might be making some objects stop movement. If I can move the stop rule, maybe I can make the walls not stop me.

There's also a ball at 1 right and 4 up. Balls can be pushed, so maybe I can use the ball to break through walls or something. But I'm not sure how that would help with the win being behind a wall.

Another idea: maybe I can change the rules to make Baba able to pass through walls. If I can create a rule like ""baba is pass,"" then I could walk through walls. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule on the map. Alternatively, maybe I can make the walls into something else, like ""wall is you,"" but that might not make sense.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 4 step up."" That's probably a rule block that says ""IS"" at 4 up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""wall is pass"" or something like that.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" So I need to check if the rule blocks are movable. Since ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 up, maybe the other rule blocks are movable.

Let me think about the steps. I need to get to the win, which is behind a wall. So I need to either move the wall or change the rules so that I can pass through it.

If I can move the wall rule, maybe I can make the wall into something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, making ""wall is pass"" would allow me to walk through them.

But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to a ""wall"" rule. For example, if I can get ""wall is pass,"" but I don't have a ""pass"" block. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the win condition something else. If I can change the win rule, maybe I can win without going through the wall. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, there's a key and a door. Maybe I need to get the key to open the door, which would then allow me to reach the win. The key is at 7 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So I need to get to the key first, then to the door.

But to get to the key, I have to go through walls. So again, I need to find a way to pass through walls or move them.

Another thought: maybe I can push the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will destroy the wall. But I'm not sure if that works in this game.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position so that the walls don't stop me. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then maybe the walls won't block my movement.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it by pushing it with Baba. But to do that, I need to get next to it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. So I need to move up 3 steps to reach it.

Wait, let me check the positions again. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, which is the same level as the door and key. So if I can get to 3 up, I can move the ""stop"" rule.

But to get to 3 up, I have to go through walls. So I'm stuck again.

Maybe I can create a new rule that makes the walls not stop me. If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't know if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is pass,"" but I don't have a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can use the ""is"" rule and another word to create it.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 4 step up."" Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba is pass,"" but I don't have a ""pass"" block. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so that wherever I am, I win. But I don't see a ""win"" rule near me. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, which is far away.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position. If I can bring the ""win"" rule next to me, then I can win without moving far. But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to get next to it and push it.

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up, which is behind walls. So I can't reach it unless I can move through walls.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to find another approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. The other rules are ""wall is stop,"" ""is is is,"" ""win is win,"" etc. Maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule or the ""stop"" rule, I can change the rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then walls won't block me.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""wall"" rule or the ""stop"" rule to create a new rule.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 4 step up."" Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, so that the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I can push the ""stop"" rule to a different location, so that it's no longer associated with the walls.

But to push it, I need to be next to it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up, so I need to move up 3 steps. But the way is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can go around the walls. Let me check the map again.

The walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So if I go to the left, maybe I can find a path. But the ""rule `wall`"" is at 1 left and 4 up, which might be a wall rule that's making the walls solid.

If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the walls' properties.

For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to make ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, making ""wall is pass"" would allow me to walk through them.

But I don't have a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the ""is"" rule next to a ""pass"" word, but I don't see a ""pass"" word on the map.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's see, the key is at 7 right and 3 up, and the door is at 5 right and 3 up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead to the win.

But to get the key, I need to go through walls. So I need to find a way to pass through walls or move them.

Wait, there's a ball at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can push the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will destroy the wall, creating a path.

But I'm not sure if that works. Let me try to plan the steps:

1. Move right to reach the ball.
2. Push the ball to the right, into the wall at 4 right and 4 up.
3. If the wall breaks, I can proceed further right.

But I need to check if the ball can break walls. In Baba Is You, usually, objects can be pushed, but walls are solid unless the rules change.

So maybe pushing the ball into the wall won't do anything unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is pass,"" then I can walk through walls by using the ball.

But again, I don't have a ""pass"" rule. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is you,"" so that I can control the ball. Then, I can move the ball to create paths.

But I already control Baba, so that might not help. Unless I can switch control to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is win,"" so that when I reach the ball, I win. But the ball is at 1 right and 4 up, which is not the win position.

This is getting a bit frustrating. Let me try to summarize:

- I need to reach the win at 9 right and 5 up.
- The path is blocked by walls.
- I can try to change the rules to make walls passable or move the walls.
- Alternatively, I can try to get the key to open the door, but that also requires moving through walls.

Maybe the key is the way to go. Let me focus on that.

To get the key at 7 right and 3 up, I need to move right and up, but walls are in the way. So I need to find a way to bypass the walls.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to avoid the walls. Let me see:

- Starting position: let's assume I'm at (0,0).
- Walls are at (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1).
- So moving right to 4 is blocked by walls at various up positions.

But if I move up first, maybe I can go around.

For example:

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Then right to (1,1), (2,1), etc., avoiding the walls at (4,1).

But I need to check if there are walls at those positions. The walls are at 4 right and various up, so moving right to 3 or 5 might be possible.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and 5 up, so moving to 3 right and 5 up is possible.

Let me try to plan a path:

- Move up 5 steps to (0,5).
- Then right to (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) is a wall, so can't go further right at 5 up.
- So I need to go down from (3,5) to (3,4), then right to (4,4) is a wall, so can't.

Hmm, that's blocked.

Alternatively, move up to (0,4), then right to (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) is a wall. So stuck again.

Wait, maybe I can move up to (0,3), then right to (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) is a wall. Still blocked.

This isn't working. Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable.

Let me look for rule blocks that I can move. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up, which is near the win. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. Maybe I can move that.

If I can move the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is pass,"" but I don't have a ""pass"" rule. Alternatively, making ""wall is not stop.""

But I don't have a ""not"" rule. Maybe I can use the ""is"" rule and another word to create a new rule.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 4 step up."" Maybe I can move that to create ""wall is something.""

For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, making ""wall is something."" But I need to figure out what ""something"" is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is something.""

But I'm not sure. This is getting too abstract.

Maybe I should try to move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, then the walls won't have the ""stop"" property anymore.

So, to do that, I need to get next to the ""stop"" rule, which is at 3 up. But the way is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can go around. Let me try:

1. Move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) is a wall. Can't go further right at 0 up.
2. Move up to (3,1), then right to (4,1) is a wall. Can't go further.
3. Move up to (3,2), right to (4,2) is a wall. Still blocked.

This isn't working. Maybe I need to change the rules differently.

Wait, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 right and 1 down. Maybe I can use that to change my properties.

If I can make ""you is pass,"" then I can walk through walls. But I don't have a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, making ""you is win"" would mean that wherever I am, I win. But the win rule is far away.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me think about the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you."" I need to find a way to change the rules to make the walls passable or to move the win condition.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win."" Then, wherever I am, I win. But I don't have a ""win"" rule near me. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position. If I can bring it next to me, then I can win without moving far.

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to be next to it, which is behind walls.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another way. Let me check the objects again.

There's a key at 7 right and 3 up, and a door at 5 right and 3 up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead to the win.

But to get the key, I need to go through walls. So I need to find a way to pass through walls or move them.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball to break through walls. If I can push the ball into a wall, maybe it will destroy the wall.

Let me try to plan that:

1. Move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0) is a wall. Can't go further.
2. Move up to (3,1), then right to (4,1) is a wall. Can't go further.
3. Move up to (3,2), right to (4,2) is a wall. Still blocked.

Hmm, I can't even reach the ball because it's at 1 right and 4 up, which is behind walls.

Wait, maybe I can move up first to reach the ball.

1. Move up to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). Now at (0,5).
2. Move right to (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) is a wall. Can't go further.

Still stuck.

Maybe I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move it to create a new rule, like ""wall is pass,"" but I don't have a ""pass"" rule.

Alternatively, making ""wall is not stop."" But I don't have a ""not"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule and another word to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""wall is you,"" then the walls would become me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, making ""wall is baba,"" but I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me think about the key and door again.

If I can get the key, I can open the door, which might lead to the win. So maybe I should focus on getting the key.

But to get the key, I need to go through walls. So I need to find a way to pass through walls or move them.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, so that the walls no longer stop me.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I can move it to a different position, then the walls won't have the ""stop"" property anymore.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be next to it, which is at 3 up. But the way is","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's a bit far, but maybe I can move towards it. There's also a rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 5 up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right and 5 up. So the win rule is pretty far to the right and up. There's another wall at 1 step left and 4 up, which is closer. 

There's a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe that's useful? I can move the ball if it's not stopped. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up, which might block movement. Doors and keys are at 5 right and 3 up, and 7 right and 3 up. So maybe I need to get a key to open a door.

The key is at 7 right and 3 up. To get there, I might need to move right a few times. But there are walls in the way. Let me see my position. I'm at the starting point, which is probably the origin (0,0). 

I need to figure out how to move towards the key or the win. Since the win is at 9 right and 5 up, that's quite a distance. Maybe I should first move towards the key. But to get to the key at 7 right and 3 up, I need to move right 7 steps and up 3. But there are walls blocking the way. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. So if I move up 3, I might hit a stop. Maybe I should avoid that. Alternatively, maybe I can move around the walls. Let me see the walls: at 4 right and 5 up, 4 right and 4 up, 4 right and 3 up, 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, and 4 right. So there's a column of walls at 4 right from up 1 to up 5. That's a solid wall on the right side.

So moving right beyond 4 steps is blocked. But the key is at 7 right, which is beyond that. Hmm, maybe I need to break through the wall or find another way. Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to bypass the wall.

Let me check the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 left and 4 up. Maybe if I move that, I can change the wall's properties. If I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can make it something else, like ""stop"" or ""key,"" which might help me pass.

To move the ""wall"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. It's at 1 left and 4 up. So I need to move left 1 and up 4. But moving left from the origin would take me to (-1,0), which might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to reach the same level.

Wait, I'm at (0,0). To get to (-1,4), I need to move left once and up four times. But moving left from (0,0) would take me to (-1,0), which might be blocked by the edge of the map. Maybe I can't move left from the origin. So perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first. If I move up, I can get closer to the ""wall"" rule. Let's say I move up once to (0,1). Then, I can move left to (-1,1), but that might not help. Alternatively, moving up to (0,4) would get me closer to the ""wall"" rule at (-1,4). From (0,4), I can move left to (-1,4) and then move the ""wall"" rule.

But wait, can I move the ""wall"" rule? The rule is ""wall"" at (-1,4). If I move it, I can change what ""wall"" means. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""is"" and ""key,"" I can make ""wall is key,"" which would turn all walls into keys. That could be useful because then I can break through walls by picking up keys.

So the plan is: move up to (0,4), then left to (-1,4), then move the ""wall"" rule to make a new rule like ""wall is key."" Once that's done, walls become keys, and I can collect them to pass through.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I need to move it next to another rule component. The ""is"" rule is at (8,5), which is far away. Alternatively, there's an ""is"" rule at (4,4). Wait, looking back, the ""is"" rule is at 4 step up, which is (0,4). So if I'm at (-1,4), I can move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), which is where the ""is"" rule is. That would create ""wall is"" at (0,4), but I need a third part to make a complete rule. Maybe I can move another rule component there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to (1,4) and then move an ""is"" next to it. But I'm not sure. This seems complicated.

Maybe a simpler approach is to move towards the key. The key is at (7,3). But the walls are blocking the way at (4, y). So I can't go beyond x=4. Unless I can change the wall's properties.

Wait, if I can make walls into something passable, like ""stop,"" then I can walk through them. Or maybe make them ""you,"" so I can control them. Alternatively, making them ""key"" would allow me to collect them and possibly open doors.

So, to change the wall's property, I need to create a new rule. Let's say I move the ""wall"" rule to be next to ""is"" and another property. For example, moving ""wall"" to (x,y) where ""is"" and ""key"" are, to make ""wall is key.""

But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule. Let's see, the ""wall"" rule is at (-1,4). I can move it to (0,4), which is where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can move another rule component to (1,4) to complete the rule. For example, moving ""key"" to (1,4) would make ""wall is key.""

But how do I move ""key""? The key is at (7,3). That's far away. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving ""wall"" next to ""is"" and another property.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""wall"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at (0,4). So if I move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), I can then move another rule component to (1,4) to complete the rule.

Wait, but moving the ""wall"" rule to (0,4) would overwrite the existing ""is"" rule, which might not be good. Maybe I should find another ""is"" rule. Looking back, there's an ""is"" rule at (8,5) and another at (4,4). So maybe I can use the one at (4,4).

So, moving the ""wall"" rule from (-1,4) to (4,4), which is where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can move another rule component to (5,4) to complete the rule. For example, moving ""key"" to (5,4) would make ""wall is key.""

But again, moving ""key"" from (7,3) to (5,4) is a long distance. Maybe I can find a closer rule component. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1, -1), which is below me. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule like ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop movement, but that's the default. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to control walls. Then, I could move them out of the way. That could be useful.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at (1,-1). So I need to move the ""wall"" rule to (x,y) where ""is"" and ""you"" are. But that's a long way down. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up. The ""you"" rule is at (1,-1). If I can move it up to (1,4), then I can create ""wall is you"" by moving ""wall"" to (0,4) and ""you"" to (1,4).

But moving the ""you"" rule requires being adjacent to it. I'm at (0,0). To get to (1,-1), I need to move right and down, but down from (0,0) might not be possible. Or maybe it is, but I'm not sure.

This seems too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's look at the ball. The ball is at (1,4). Maybe I can move the ball to create a new rule. If I move the ball next to ""is"" and another property, I can make a new rule involving the ball.

For example, moving the ball to (x,y) where ""is"" and ""win"" are, to make ""ball is win."" Then, touching the ball would win the level. But the ""win"" rule is at (9,5), which is far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key or a door. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the key is at (7,3). If I can get to the key, I can open the door at (5,3). But the walls are blocking the way. So I need to find a way to pass through the walls.

Maybe I can make the walls into something passable. If I can make walls into ""stop,"" then I can walk through them. Or make them into ""you,"" so I can control them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (3,3). If I move it, I can change what stops movement. For example, making ""wall is stop"" would mean walls stop movement, which is the default. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make ""stop is you,"" so I can control stop blocks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to make ""stop is win,"" so stepping on a stop block would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving in a direction and see what happens. Let's try moving right. From (0,0), moving right to (1,0). Then, I can move up to (1,1), but there's a wall at (4,1). So I can't go beyond x=4.

Alternatively, moving up first. From (0,0), move up to (0,1). Then, up to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). At (0,4), I can move left to (-1,4) to get to the ""wall"" rule. Then, I can move the ""wall"" rule to (0,4), which is where the ""is"" rule is. That would create ""wall is"" at (0,4). Then, I need to add another component to make a complete rule.

But I'm not sure what to add. Maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to (1,4), making ""wall is key."" That would turn all walls into keys. Then, I can collect the walls as keys and open doors.

But moving the ""key"" rule from (7,3) to (1,4) is a long distance. I'm not sure if that's feasible. Maybe I can find a closer rule component. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to (1,4), making ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to control walls.

But moving the ""you"" rule from (1,-1) to (1,4) requires moving it up 5 steps. That's possible if I can get there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from (0,4) to (1,4), making ""wall is"" at (1,4). Then, I can move another component to (2,4) to complete the rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see, the win rule is at (9,5). That's far to the right and up. Maybe I can create a rule that allows me to move faster or teleport.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" so wherever Baba is, that's the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-1). If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""win,"" I can make ""baba is win."" Then, Baba becomes the win condition, and I can win by being anywhere.

But moving the ""baba"" rule from (-1,-1) to (8,5) where ""win"" is would require a lot of steps. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" rule is at (9,5). If I can move it to (0,0), then I can win immediately. But that's a long distance.

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule to make walls into something else. Let's say I move the ""wall"" rule to (4,4), where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can move another rule component to (5,4) to make ""wall is key."" That way, walls become keys, and I can collect them.

But again, moving the ""key"" rule from (7,3) to (5,4) is a long distance. Maybe I can find a closer rule component. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to (5,4), making ""wall is you,"" which would allow me to control walls.

But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving in a direction and see what happens. Let's try moving up to (0,1), then up to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). At (0,4), I can move left to (-1,4) to get the ""wall"" rule. Then, I can move it to (0,4), making ""wall is"" there. Then, I need to add another component.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to (4,4), where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can move another rule component to (5,4) to complete the rule.

I think the best approach is to move the ""wall"" rule to (4,4), making ""wall is"" there, and then move the ""key"" rule to (5,4), making ""wall is key."" That way, walls become keys, and I can collect them to open doors.

But how do I move the ""key"" rule? It's at (7,3). I need to move it to (5,4). That's moving left 2 and up 1. But I can't carry it that far. Maybe I can move it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule closer by moving it left and up incrementally. But that would take many steps, and I'm not sure if it's feasible.

Maybe a better approach is to move the ""wall"" rule to (4,4), making ""wall is"" there, and then move the ""you"" rule to (5,4), making ""wall is you."" That would allow me to control walls, which could help me move through them.

But moving the ""you"" rule from (1,-1) to (5,4) is a long distance. I'm not sure.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try a different strategy. Let's see, the ball is at (1,4). Maybe I can use it to create a rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, making ""ball is key,"" so the ball becomes a key, and I can use it to open doors.

But the door is at (5,3), and the key is at (7,3). So if I can get the key, I can open the door. But the walls are blocking the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. If I make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win the level. But the ball is at (1,4), which is close. So how do I make that rule?

I need to move the ""ball"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win."" The ""is"" rule is at (0,4), and ""win"" is at (9,5). So moving the ""ball"" rule to (0,4) would make ""ball is"" there, and then moving ""win"" to (1,4) would make ""ball is win.""

But moving ""win"" from (9,5) to (1,4) is a long distance. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer. If I can move it to (1,4), then I can make ""ball is win."" But again, moving it is difficult.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try moving towards the key and see if I can find a way through. Let's try moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). At (1,3), I can move right to (2,3), but there's a wall at (4,3). So I can't go beyond x=4.

Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), where the ball is. Maybe I can move the ball to create a new rule. If I move the ball to (0,4), making ""ball is"" there, and then move another rule component to (1,4) to complete the rule.

But I'm not sure. This is really tricky. I think the best approach is to move the ""","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That seems pretty far. There's also a ""key"" object 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a ""door"" 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, maybe I need to get the key to open the door to reach the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. Walls are placed at various positions, and some rules define them as ""wall."" I can't move through walls unless I change the rules. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps up, which probably means that object stops movement. So, I need to figure out how to move around or change these rules.

I also see a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something or change a rule. There are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around, which are essential for creating new rules. If I can move these around, I might be able to redefine what Baba is or create new properties.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since I'm trying to reach the key and door, moving right seems necessary. But there are walls blocking the way. Maybe I can move some ""is"" rules to create a new rule that makes walls passable or removes them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make Baba into something else, like a ""key"" or ""door,"" to bypass the walls. If I can change the rules so that Baba is a key, I might be able to open the door without needing the physical key.

Wait, there's a ""rule `baba`"" 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Maybe I can move that to change Baba's properties. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, I can redefine Baba. For example, if I make ""baba is key,"" then I can open the door directly.

So, the plan is: move towards the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `is`"" to create a new rule. Once I redefine Baba as a key, I can move through the door and reach the win.

But how do I get there? The ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step left and 1 step down from my current position. I need to move left and down to reach it. Let me check if there are any walls blocking that path. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, but I'm moving left, so maybe that's not an issue.

Wait, I'm currently at the starting position. The ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step left and 1 step down. So, I should move left first, then down. But I need to make sure there are no walls in that path. The observation shows walls at various positions, but I don't see a wall directly to the left or down from my current spot. So, moving left and then down should be possible.

Once I'm next to the ""rule `baba`,"" I can move the ""rule `is`"" next to it to create ""baba is [something]."" If I can move the ""rule `is`"" that's 1 step down to be next to ""rule `baba`,"" then I can form a new rule. For example, if I move the ""rule `is`"" to the right of ""rule `baba`,"" it would create ""baba is [new property].""

But I need to figure out what property to assign. Maybe making Baba a key would help, as there's a door in the way. So, I need to find a ""key"" rule and place it after ""baba is."" The ""key"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is quite far. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule on the spot.

Wait, perhaps I can use the existing ""key"" object. If I can move the ""key"" next to the ""is"" rule and then next to ""baba,"" I can create ""baba is key."" That would allow me to open the door.

But moving the key might be difficult because it's 7 steps away. Maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule and another rule next to ""baba.""

Let me try to move towards the ""rule `baba`"" first. So, I'll move left to get next to it, then down to position myself correctly. Once there, I can start moving the ""is"" rule into place.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step down next to ""baba"" to create a new rule. If I can do that, I can redefine Baba's properties.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step down from my current position. So, if I move down, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to ""baba."" That way, I can form a new rule like ""baba is [something].""

But I need to figure out what to make Baba into. If I make Baba a ""key,"" I can open the door. So, I need to find a ""key"" rule or object to place after ""is.""

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba a ""win"" to end the level immediately, but that might not be possible if the win condition is far away.

Another idea: if I can make walls passable, I can walk through them. To do that, I need to change the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. If I can move that rule, I can redefine what a wall is. For example, making ""wall is pass"" would allow me to walk through walls.

But that might be complicated. Maybe it's easier to redefine Baba as a key.

So, to summarize, my steps should be:

1. Move left to reach the ""rule `baba`"" position.
2. Move down to position myself next to it.
3. Move the ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `baba`"" to create a new rule.
4. Find a ""key"" rule or object to complete the rule, making Baba a key.
5. Use the new property to open the door and reach the win.

But I need to make sure I can move the necessary rules without being blocked by walls. Let me check the path again. Moving left and down seems clear, so I'll proceed with that.

First, I'll move left to get next to ""rule `baba`."" Then, I'll move down to position myself correctly. Once there, I'll start moving the ""is"" rule into place to create the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule first. Let me see: the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step down. If I move down, I can pick it up and move it next to ""baba.""

Wait, but I'm Baba, and I can only move objects that are not ""stop."" So, I need to make sure the ""is"" rule isn't a stop. The ""rule `stop`"" is 3 steps up, so it's not affecting the ""is"" rule I need.

So, moving down to get the ""is"" rule, then moving it next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is [something].""

Once that's done, I can find a ""key"" rule or object to complete the rule. If I can make ""baba is key,"" I can open the door.

Alternatively, if I can't find a ""key"" rule nearby, maybe I can create a new rule by moving another rule into place.

This is getting a bit complicated, but I think the key is to redefine Baba's properties to bypass the door or walls.

Another thought: maybe I can make the door into a passable object. The ""rule `door`"" is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I can change that rule, I might be able to walk through the door without needing a key.

But that would require moving the ""door"" rule, which might be tricky.

I think the most straightforward approach is to make Baba a key. So, I'll focus on that.

First, move left to get next to ""rule `baba`."" Then, move down to position myself correctly. Once there, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is [something].""

Then, I'll need to find a ""key"" rule or object to complete the rule. If I can move a ""key"" rule next to the ""is,"" I can make ""baba is key.""

Once that's done, I can move towards the door, which should open automatically since I'm now a key.

After opening the door, I can proceed towards the ""win"" rule, which is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's quite far, but once the door is open, I can move right and up to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is closer once the door is opened. I need to check the map again.

Looking back, the ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 5 up, which is near the top right. The door is 5 right and 3 up, so after opening the door, I can move further right and up to reach the win.

So, the plan is:

1. Move left to reach ""rule `baba`.""
2. Move down to position next to it.
3. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is [something].""
4. Find a ""key"" rule or object to complete the rule, making Baba a key.
5. Move right towards the door, which should open.
6. Continue moving right and up to reach the ""win"" rule.

I think this is the best course of action. Now, I'll choose the first step, which is moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, and some other items. The ""win"" rule is 10 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. There's also a ""key"" 1 step to the right, which might be useful for opening a door. The ""door"" is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and the ""key"" is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Hmm, so maybe I need to get the key to open the door to reach the win.

But wait, there are a lot of walls in the way. The walls are positioned at various steps to the right and up, which might block my path. I also see a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up, which probably means that if I move into that area, I can't move further. So I need to be careful about that.

I also notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange some of these to change the game's rules in my favor. For example, if I can move a ""win"" rule closer, I might be able to reach it without going all the way to the far right.

Let me think about my current position. I'm at the starting point, and I need to figure out how to move. The key is just 1 step to the right, so maybe I should pick that up first. But to get to the key, I need to move right once. Let me try that.

After moving right, I have the key. Now, I need to get to the door, which is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can break through them by changing the rules. If I can make the walls stop being walls, I can pass through.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""wall"" rule 4 steps up. If I can move that rule somewhere else or change it, maybe I can make the walls passable. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule that makes walls stop being solid.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that rule to the walls, maybe I can make them stop me, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make the walls not stop me, that would be better.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving some rules around. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I might be able to create a new rule that changes the win condition. Or perhaps I can make myself into something else to bypass the walls.

Another idea: since I have the key, maybe I can use it to open the door without worrying about the walls. But to get to the door, I need to move right 6 steps and up 3 steps. Let me see if that's possible without hitting any walls.

Wait, the walls are at 5 steps to the right and various up steps. So if I move right 5 steps, I'll hit a wall. Maybe I can go around. Let me try moving up first to avoid the walls.

If I move up once, I can then move right to avoid the wall. Let me try that. Moving up once, then right 5 steps. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So that's blocked. Hmm.

Maybe I can move up more. If I move up 2 steps, then right 5 steps. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. Still blocked.

Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right and 5 up, 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, and at the same right steps. So moving right 5 steps is blocked at every up level. That's a problem.

Perhaps I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to make it not a wall, I can pass through. Let me see where the ""wall"" rule is. It's 4 steps up. If I can move that rule to combine with something else, maybe I can redefine what a wall is.

Alternatively, I could try to make myself into a wall, but that doesn't seem helpful. Or maybe make the walls into something else, like air.

Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps up. If I can move that to the walls, maybe I can make them stop me, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I can make the walls not stop me, that would be better.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but that's the opposite of what I want.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, which might allow me to pass through them. That could work.

So, to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and the ""you"" rule. Let me see where those are. The ""wall"" rule is 4 steps up, and the ""you"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Hmm, that's a bit far.

Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is. If I can get the ""is"" rule next to both ""wall"" and ""you,"" I can create ""wall is you,"" which would make walls be me, allowing me to pass through them.

But moving the ""is"" rule requires that it's not stopped by anything. Let me check the path. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. To move it down, I need to move it left or right and down.

Wait, I'm Baba, so I can move the ""is"" rule by moving into it. Let me try moving up to where the ""is"" rule is. Once I'm there, I can move it down.

So, my plan is:

1. Move right once to get the key.
2. Move up to reach the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is.
4. Create the rule ""wall is you"" to make walls passable.
5. Then, move through the walls to reach the door and use the key to open it.
6. Finally, move to the ""win"" rule to complete the level.

Let me try that. First, move right to get the key. Then, move up to the ""is"" rule. Now, I can move the ""is"" rule down. Let me move it down to the same level as the ""you"" rule. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to both ""wall"" and ""you,"" creating ""wall is you."" 

Now, walls are me, so I can pass through them. Great! Now, I can move right through the walls. Let me go right 5 steps and up 3 steps to reach the door. Use the key to open the door, then move to the ""win"" rule at 10 steps right and 5 up. 

Wait, but after opening the door, I might need to adjust my path. Let me make sure I can get through without hitting any other walls. Since the walls are now passable, I should be able to navigate freely.

I think this plan should work. So, the key steps are moving the ""is"" rule to create ""wall is you,"" allowing me to pass through walls, then using the key to open the door and reach the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, rules, a ball, a key, a door, and some other stuff. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I need to figure out how to get there.

First, I should note the positions of important objects. The key is at 1 step to the right, which is close. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. There are also several rule blocks that might be useful.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't go through walls unless I change the rules. The walls are at various positions, so I need to be careful not to get stuck. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up, which might mean that if I move that, I can change what stops me.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make movement easier. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls will block me, but maybe I can change that. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the key is nearby. Maybe I can pick it up and use it to open the door. The door is further up, so I might need to go through it. But to get to the door, I have to navigate around or through walls.

Let me plan my path. Starting from my current position, I can move right to get closer to the key. If I move right once, I'll be next to the key. Then I can pick it up. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking me. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and various up positions, so I might have a clear path to the key.

After picking up the key, I can move towards the door. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 up. I need to see if there's a path there. There are walls at 4 right and 3 up, so maybe I can go around them. Alternatively, if I can change the rules to make walls passable, that would help.

Another idea: if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 5 up. That's quite far. Maybe I can create a shortcut by changing the rules. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition, and I just need to reach it.

The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. That's closer. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I can win by reaching the ball. But how do I move the rule blocks to create that?

I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win."" Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one at 8 right and 5 up, another at 4 up, and another at 1 down. Maybe I can move the ""is"" at 4 up next to ""ball"" at 1 right and 4 up. That would create ""ball is win"" if I place ""win"" next to it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. But that might be difficult because it's far away. Maybe it's better to focus on the key and door first.

So, step by step:

1. Move right to pick up the key.
2. Use the key to open the door.
3. Go through the door to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure the path is clear. Let me check the walls. There are walls at 4 right and various up positions, so I might need to go around them. Maybe moving up first to avoid walls.

Wait, if I move up, I can go towards the ball. The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I can win by reaching the ball. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule closer. But that's at 9 right and 5 up, which is too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is at my position, so I can move the ""is"" rule next to me and the ""win"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. If I can move it next to me, I can create ""baba is win."" But that requires moving the ""is"" rule, which might be tricky because it's far away.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to me. But that's also far. Maybe it's better to focus on the key and door.

So, let's try to get the key first. I'm currently at position (0,0). The key is at 1 right, so (1,0). I can move right once to get it. Then, I can use it to open the door at 5 right and 3 up.

But to get to the door, I need to move right 5 times and up 3 times. Are there walls blocking that path? Let me check. Walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so at 4 right and 3 up, there's a wall. That blocks the path to the door. So I can't go straight to the door.

Maybe I can go around the wall. If I move up first, I can go over the wall. Let's see: from (1,0), move up to (1,1), then right to (2,1), up to (2,2), etc. But I need to check if there are walls in that path.

Looking at the map, walls are at 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, etc. So moving up and right might still hit walls. Maybe I need to change the rules to make walls passable.

If I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""not."" But I don't see a ""not"" rule on the map. Alternatively, I can break the existing ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move it, I can change the rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""something else"" to redefine it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule away from ""wall."" The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it somewhere else, maybe the walls won't stop me.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Maybe I should try to get the key first and see if I can open the door without dealing with the walls.

Wait, the door is at 5 right and 3 up. If I can get the key, I can open it, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can go up first to avoid the walls.

From (1,0), move up to (1,1), then right to (2,1), up to (2,2), right to (3,2), up to (3,3), and so on. But I need to check if there are walls in that path.

Looking at the map, walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so at (4,3), there's a wall. So when I get to (4,3), I can't go further right. But if I go up first, maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""baba is pass."" But I don't see a ""pass"" rule on the map.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then I can win by reaching the ball. But I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up, which is too far. Maybe I can move it closer. But that would require a lot of steps, and I might get stuck.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. But that's also far.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" That way, I can win by being myself. But the ""is"" rule is far away.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. If I can move it next to me, I can create ""baba is win."" But how? I need to move the ""is"" rule, but it's far.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""win"" rule next to me. But that's also far. Maybe I can break the existing rules to create a new one.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move it, I can change the rule. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule next to ""stop,"" I can make ""wall is stop,"" which is the default, but maybe I can change it.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule next to something else to change what stops me.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move right to get the key and see what happens.

So, I'll move right once to pick up the key. Now I have the key. Next, I need to get to the door at 5 right and 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can go up first to avoid them.

From (1,0), move up to (1,1), then right to (2,1), up to (2,2), right to (3,2), up to (3,3), right to (4,3). But at (4,3), there's a wall, so I can't go further right. Hmm.

Maybe I can go up more. From (4,3), move up to (4,4), then right to (5,4). But the door is at (5,3), so I'm above it. Maybe I can move down to (5,3) to open the door.

But I need to check if there's a wall at (5,3). Looking at the map, the door is at 5 right and 3 up, so (5,3). There's a wall at 4 right and 3 up, which is (4,3), but (5,3) is the door. So I can move down from (5,4) to (5,3) to open the door.

Once I open the door, I can go through it. But what's behind the door? I need to see if there's a path to the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make the door open without needing the key. But I have the key, so maybe it's better to use it.

Wait, I have the key, so I can open the door. Let me try that.

So, path:

1. Move right to (1,0) to get the key.
2. Move up to (1,1).
3. Move right to (2,1).
4. Move up to (2,2).
5. Move right to (3,2).
6. Move up to (3,3).
7. Move right to (4,3) – but there's a wall here. Can't move right.
8. Move up to (4,4).
9. Move right to (5,4).
10. Move down to (5,3) to open the door.

Now, I'm at (5,3) with the key. I can open the door and go through it. What's on the other side? I need to check the map.

Looking at the map, after the door at (5,3), there's a wall at (5,2), so I can't go down. Maybe I can go up further.

From (5,3), move up to (5,4), then right to (6,4), etc., but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the win condition is behind the door.

Wait, the win rule is at 9 right and 5 up, which is far to the right. Maybe I need to go all the way right after opening the door.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to create a new rule to make movement easier.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" But the ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up, which is far. Maybe I can move it closer.

Wait, I can move the ""is"" rule by moving it as an object. Since I have the key, I can move the ""is"" rule if it's not blocked. Let me see.

The ""is"" rule is at 8 right and 5 up. To move it, I need to be next to it. But that's too far. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move it.

Alternatively, I can try to break the existing rules. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule, I can change what walls do.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I move it next to ""not,"" I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't see a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, I can move it next to something else.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move up first to reach the ball and see if I can make it the win condition.

From (0,0), move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), up to (1,2), right to (2,2), up to (2,3), right to (3,3), up to (3,4), right to (4,4), up to (4,5). Now I'm at (4,5). The ""is"" rule is at (8,5). I can move right to get closer.

But this is taking too many steps, and I might get stuck. Maybe I should focus on the key and door again.

Wait, I have the key. Let me try to go through the door. After opening the door at (5,3), I can move up to (5,4), then right to (6,4), up to (6,5), and so on towards the win condition at (9,5).

But I need to check if there are walls blocking that path. The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so at (6,5), there's no wall mentioned. So I can move right to (9,5) to reach the win condition.

Wait, the win rule is at 9 right and 5 up, which is (9,5). So if I can get there, I can win.

So, the plan is:

1. Move right to (1,0) to get the key.
2. Move up to (1,1), right to (2,1), up to (2,2), right to (3,2), up to (3,3), right to (4,3) – can't move right due to wall.
3. Move up to (4,4), right to (5,4), down to (5,3) to open the door.
4. Move up to (5,4), right to (6,4), up to (6,5), right to (7,5), right to (8,5), right to (9,5) to reach the win condition.

But I need to make sure there are no walls blocking the path from (5,4) to (9,5). The walls are at 4 right and various up positions, so at (5,4), (6,4), etc., there are no walls mentioned. So I can proceed.

Therefore, the next step is to move right to get the key.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 8 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice a key that's 1 step to the left. Maybe I need the key to open a door or something.

Wait, there's a door rule at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Doors usually require keys to open. So maybe I need to get the key first. The key is 1 step to the left, but I'm not sure where exactly that is. Let me visualize the map.

I'm currently at some position, and the key is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick up the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and open it. But before that, I need to make sure I can move towards the door and the win condition.

There are a lot of walls around. I need to navigate through them. The ball is 4 steps up, so maybe it's blocking something or I can use it somehow. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up, which might mean that if I move into that area, I can't go further. I need to avoid that or use it to my advantage.

The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. That might mean that if I move there, I can change the rules or something. But I'm not sure yet. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is 1 step down. Maybe these can be rearranged to change the rules.

I think the best course of action is to first move left to get the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door, open it, and proceed towards the win condition. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move left to pick up the key.
2. Move right towards the door.
3. Use the key to open the door.
4. Navigate through the door and towards the win condition.

But wait, I need to make sure there are no walls blocking my path. The walls are at various positions, so I need to carefully move around them. Also, the ""stop"" rule might prevent me from moving into certain areas, so I should avoid those.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the walls passable or to change the win condition. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would stop me, but if I can change that, maybe I can walk through them.

But for now, I think the simplest path is to get the key, open the door, and proceed to the win. So, moving left to get the key seems like the first step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far. I also notice there's a key 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I need the key to open a door?

Wait, there's a door 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, the door is between me and the key? Or maybe the key is needed to open the door. Let me think about the rules. The door is a rule, so maybe it's a door object that I need to pass through. But to open it, I might need the key.

I also see a ball 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to break something or change a rule. But I'm not sure yet.

The rules on the map include ""wall is stop,"" which means walls can't be moved through. There's also ""baba is you,"" which I already know. I need to see if I can change any rules to make progress.

Looking at the positions, I'm currently at the starting point. The walls are arranged in a way that might block my path. I need to find a way to get past them. Maybe I can move some rules around to change the properties of objects.

I see a rule ""is"" 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could make ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is. If I make ""baba is key,"" then I could pick up the key and open the door. That might be a way to proceed.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get to the key, but the door is in the way. If I can make myself into a key, I can open the door. So, I should try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""baba."" That way, I can create ""baba is key.""

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule that's 4 steps up. I can move it down to where ""baba"" is. But how? I can only move one step at a time. Let me see the positions again.

The ""is"" rule is 4 steps up. I need to move it down. So, I can move down step by step. Each time, I'll move the ""is"" rule closer to ""baba."" Once it's next to ""baba,"" I can form the new rule ""baba is key.""

Once I have ""baba is key,"" I can pick up the key and then open the door. After that, I can proceed towards the win condition.

So, my first move should be to move the ""is"" rule down. Let me try moving down.

There's also a key at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a door at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So, I think I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that the rule ""wall"" is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that rule to change what counts as a wall. If I can make the walls stop being walls, I can pass through them.

I also see a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can make the walls stop me or not. Hmm, but I'm not sure how to use that yet.

The ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push something, but I'm not sure. I'm more focused on the win, door, and key.

I think the key is at 7 right, 3 up, and the door is at 5 right, 3 up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door. But to get to the key, I might need to move through some walls. That's where the ""wall"" rule comes in. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, maybe I can make the walls passable.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps up. Maybe I can combine that with something else. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then the walls would stop me, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls wouldn't block me.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to the wall's position, then the walls would stop me. But I want to pass through them, so maybe I need to remove the stop property from the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is you,"" but that might not be useful. Or ""wall is win,"" but that seems off track.

I think the best approach is to move the ""wall"" rule to a position where it's not affecting the walls I need to pass. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule to the ""stop"" rule's position, then the walls might no longer be walls. Let me see: the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left, 4 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. So, if I move the ""wall"" rule down to where the ""stop"" rule is, maybe that would change the walls.

But how do I move the ""wall"" rule? I need to move the ""rule `wall`"" object. It's at 1 step left, 4 up. So, I can move left once and up four times to get there. But wait, I'm currently at the starting position. Let me check the initial position.

Wait, the initial position isn't given, but I can assume I'm at the bottom left or somewhere near the bottom. The walls are at 4 right, various up steps. So, I need to move right to get to the key and door.

But the walls are blocking the way. So, I need to change the rules to make the walls passable. Let me try to move the ""wall"" rule to a different location. If I can move it to where the ""stop"" rule is, then the walls might stop being walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""stop"" rule's position, I can create ""stop is something.""

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""stop"" rule is, I can make ""stop is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to create a new rule like ""wall is something."" If I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls won't block me.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""is"" rule left once, it would be next to the ""wall"" rule, forming ""wall is is,"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to move the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""wall"" rule right once, it would be at 0, 4 up, next to the ""is"" rule at 4 up. That would create ""wall is is,"" which is not useful.

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to a different position. Let's see, the ""is"" rule is at 4 up. If I move it down to where the ""stop"" rule is, at 3 up, then I can create a new rule with the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move the ""is"" rule down to 3 up, next to the ""stop"" rule, that would create ""stop is is,"" which isn't helpful. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule instead.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. So, if I move the ""stop"" rule up once, it would be at 1 left, 4 up, next to the ""wall"" rule, creating ""wall is stop."" That would make the walls stop me, which is the opposite of what I want.

Wait, but if walls are already stopping me, maybe I need to remove the stop property. So, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't know how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location so that the walls no longer have the stop property. If I move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, then the walls won't stop me.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? It's at 3 up. I need to move it somewhere else. Maybe to the bottom.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it down to 1 up, then it's away from the walls. But I'm not sure if that would work.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. That's too far, though.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can push the ball to break a wall or something, but I don't see how.

Wait, the ball is at 1 right, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ball next to the ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is something.""

But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe ""ball is win,"" but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. If I can move it closer, I can reach it without going through the door and key.

But moving the ""win"" rule would require moving it from 9 right, 5 up to somewhere else. That seems too far.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition. For example, if I can make ""you is win,"" then wherever I am, I win. But I'm not sure how to do that.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""you"" rule, I can create ""you is something."" If I can make ""you is win,"" then I win wherever I am.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule to the ""you"" rule's position? The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule down to 1 down, right 1.

That seems possible. Let me plan the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 4 up to 1 right, 1 down, next to the ""you"" rule. That would create ""you is is,"" which isn't helpful. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""you"" rule up to 4 up, next to the ""is"" rule, that would create ""you is is,"" which is still not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""win"" rule left to 8 right, 5 up, next to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 5 up, that would create ""win is is,"" which isn't useful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should focus on the door and key. The key is at 7 right, 3 up. The door is at 5 right, 3 up. So, if I can get the key, I can open the door and reach the win.

But to get to the key, I need to move right past the walls. The walls are at 4 right, various up steps. So, I need to make the walls passable.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different location, maybe the walls will change their properties.

For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to where the ""stop"" rule is, at 3 up, then the walls might stop being walls. Or maybe they become something else.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the walls, then the walls won't stop me.

Let me try moving the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it down to 1 up, then the walls at 4 right, 3 up might no longer have the stop property.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? I need to move it from 3 up to 1 up. That would require moving it down twice.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try moving the ""wall"" rule instead.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I move it right to 0, 4 up, next to the ""is"" rule at 4 up, that would create ""wall is is,"" which doesn't help.

Alternatively, if I move the ""wall"" rule down to 3 up, next to the ""stop"" rule, creating ""wall is stop,"" which would make the walls stop me, which is the opposite of what I want.

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule to a different location. If I move the ""stop"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is, at 9 right, 5 up, then the win rule would have the stop property, which might prevent me from winning. That doesn't seem good.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to the ""key"" rule's position. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I move the ""stop"" rule there, then the key would have the stop property, which might prevent me from picking it up. Not helpful.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let me look at the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 1 down. So, if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, I can create ""baba is something.""

If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I win wherever I am. But how do I do that?

The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 1 down. So, I need to move the ""baba"" rule up to 4 up, next to the ""is"" rule. That would create ""baba is is,"" which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. So, if I move the ""win"" rule left to 8 right, 5 up, next to the ""is"" rule, that would create ""win is is,"" which isn't useful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 5 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 5 up. So, if I move the ""is"" rule right to 9 right, 5 up, next to the ""win"" rule, that would create ""is is win,"" which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""you"" rule next to the ""is"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. So, if I move the ""you"" rule up to 4 up, next to the ""is"" rule, that would create ""you is is,"" which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""you"" rule is. The ""is"" rule is at 4 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 1 down. So, if I move the ""is"" rule down to 1 down, next to the ""you"" rule, that would create ""you is is,"" which still isn't helpful.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to try a different strategy. Let me look at the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, I can create ""ball is something.""

If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball would be the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. So, if I move the ""ball"" rule down to 3 up, next to the ""stop"" rule, that would create ""ball is stop,"" which would make the ball stop me. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball to push something. The ball is at 1 right, 4 up. If I can push it to break a wall, but I don't see any walls in that area.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to try moving the ""wall"" rule to a different location. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up. If I move it to 2 left, 4 up, then it's away from the ""is"" rule. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule to where the ""stop"" rule is, at 3 up. That would create ""wall is stop,"" which would make the walls stop me, which is the opposite of what I want.

Wait, but if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then the walls wouldn't stop me. But I don't know how to do that.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I need to try moving the ""stop"" rule to a different location. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. If I move it down to 1 up, then the walls at 4 right, 3 up might no longer have the stop property.

So, let's try that. I'll move the ""stop"" rule down to 1 up. That would require moving it down twice. But how do I do that?

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 up. To move it down to 1 up, I need to move it down twice. So, I'll move down twice from 3 up to 1 up.

But I'm not sure if that's the right move. Maybe I should try it.

After moving the ""stop"" rule down to 1 up, the walls at 4 right, 3 up might no longer have the stop property, allowing me to pass through them.

Then, I can move right to 4 right, 3 up, which was previously blocked by a wall, but now it's passable.

Once I'm at 4 right, 3 up, I can move right further to reach the key at 7 right, 3 up.

After getting the key, I can go to the door at 5 right, 3 up and open it, then proceed to the win at 9 right, 5 up.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule down to 1 up.
2. Move right to pass through the previously blocked walls.
3. Collect the key.
4. Open the door.
5. Proceed to the win.

I think that's the plan. Now, I need to execute it step by step.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually a ""WIN"" object, but I need to check the map to see where that is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a lot of walls, some rules, a ball, a door, a key, and the win rule. The win rule is at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps up. That's pretty far to the right. There's also a key at 7 steps right and 3 up, and a door at 5 right and 3 up. So maybe I need the key to open the door to get to the win.

But wait, there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at various positions, but I notice that the rule `wall` is at 1 step left and 4 up. Maybe I can move that rule to change what counts as a wall. If I can make something else a wall, I might be able to clear a path.

I also see a ball at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe I can use the ball somehow. The rules are scattered around, like `is` and `you` at different positions. I think I can move these rules to create new ones.

Let me plan this out. I need to get to the key, which is at 7 right and 3 up. But there are walls in the way. If I can move the `wall` rule to a different object, maybe I can make those walls passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let's focus on getting to the key first.

I'm at the starting position, which is where Baba is. The ball is nearby, so maybe I can push it or use it to break a wall. But I don't see a rule that makes the ball break walls, so that might not work.

Another idea: if I can move the `stop` rule, which is at 3 up, I might be able to stop certain objects from moving or blocking me. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, the `door` is at 5 right and 3 up, and the `key` is at 7 right and 3 up. So the door is between me and the key. If I can get the key, I can open the door. But to get the key, I need to get through the door, which seems like a loop.

Hmm, maybe I need to change the rules so that the door doesn't require a key. Or perhaps make the door into something else. Let me see if I can move the `door` rule.

The `door` rule is at 5 right and 3 up. If I can move it somewhere else, maybe I can redefine what a door is. For example, if I make the door into a wall, then it won't block me anymore.

But how do I move the `door` rule? I need to be able to move it by moving the text block. So I need to get next to it and move it. But to get there, I might need to go around the walls.

Let me try to navigate. Starting from my position, I can move right or up. If I move right, I might hit walls. If I move up, maybe I can go around.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So moving right 4 steps and up 5 steps would take me to the wall. That's not helpful. Maybe I should move up first.

If I move up, I can get to the rule `is` at 4 up. Maybe I can move that rule to create a new one. For example, if I move `is` next to `win`, I can make a new rule like ""win is something.""

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently. The key is at 7 right and 3 up. To get there, I need to go right 7 steps and up 3. But walls are in the way. Maybe I can break through them by changing the rules.

If I can make the walls into something else, like stop signs, then I can pass through them. To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule to a different object.

The `wall` rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move it to another object, say, the ball, then the ball would become a wall. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I can make the walls into stop signs, then they won't block me. So I need to create a rule like ""wall is stop."" But how?

I can try moving the `stop` rule to a wall. The `stop` rule is at 3 up. If I move it next to a wall, I can create ""wall is stop,"" which would make walls stop me, but that's the default behavior. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can make the walls into something else, like ""wall is you,"" so I can walk through them. But that might not be possible because ""you"" is already defined as Baba.

Alternatively, I can make the walls into ""win,"" but that might not help either.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can move the `win` rule to a different object. The `win` rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I can move it to the key, then the key becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Wait, the key is at 7 right and 3 up. If I can move the `win` rule next to the key, then ""key is win,"" which would make the key the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the key, which is behind the door.

But to get to the key, I need the door to not block me. So maybe I can change the door into something else. The `door` rule is at 5 right and 3 up. If I can move it to a wall, then the door becomes a wall, which might block me more.

Alternatively, I can make the door into a passable object. Maybe ""door is stop"" so it doesn't block. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the `is` rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be me, and I could walk through them. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, I can make ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't see a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can break the existing rules. If I move the `is` rule away from ""baba is you,"" then Baba is no longer me. That might not be good.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to move the `you` rule. The `you` rule is at 1 right and 1 down. If I can move it next to something else, I can redefine what ""you"" is.

For example, if I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me, and I can control it. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I make ""door is you,"" then the door becomes me, and I can move it. That might help in opening the door without needing the key.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me try to plan the steps.

1. Move towards the `you` rule to pick it up.
2. Move it next to the `door` rule to create ""door is you.""
3. Now, the door becomes me, and I can move it.
4. Move the door out of the way.
5. Go get the key.
6. Use the key to open the door (if needed).
7. Proceed to the win.

But I'm not sure if this will work. Let me try to visualize the map.

I'm at the starting position. The `you` rule is at 1 right and 1 down. So I can move right once and down once to get it.

Once I have the `you` rule, I can move it to the `door` rule's position, which is 5 right and 3 up. So I need to navigate there.

But there are walls in the way. Maybe I can go up first to avoid them.

Wait, the walls are at 4 right and various up positions. So if I move up 4 steps, I can go over them.

Let me try:

1. Move up 4 steps to get past the walls.
2. Then move right to get to the `you` rule.
3. Pick up the `you` rule.
4. Move it to the `door` rule's position.
5. Now, the door is me, so I can move it.
6. Move the door out of the way.
7. Go get the key.
8. Use the key to open the door (if needed).
9. Proceed to the win.

But I'm not sure if moving the `you` rule will work like that. Maybe I need to create a new rule instead of moving the existing one.

Alternatively, I can try to move the `is` rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls.

For example, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's the default. Maybe ""wall is nothing"" would make walls disappear.

But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving the `is` rule next to a non-existent object.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me look at the ball. The ball is at 1 right and 4 up. Maybe I can use it to break through walls if I can make it pushable.

But I don't see a rule that makes the ball pushable. Maybe I can create a rule like ""ball is push.""

To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to the ball and then next to the `push` rule. But I don't see a `push` rule on the map.

Hmm, maybe that's not possible. Let me think again.

Another idea: if I can make the walls into something else, like ""wall is win,"" then stepping on a wall would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, I can make the walls into ""stop,"" but that's already the case.

Wait, maybe I can make the walls into ""you,"" so I can walk through them. Let me try that.

To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to a wall and then next to the `you` rule. So:

1. Move to the `is` rule at 4 up.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move it next to a wall, say, the wall at 4 right and 4 up.
4. Then move it next to the `you` rule at 1 right and 1 down.
5. This would create ""wall is you,"" making walls into me, allowing me to walk through them.

But I'm not sure if that's the right sequence. Let me try to plan the steps.

1. Move up 4 steps to get to the `is` rule.
2. Pick up the `is` rule.
3. Move right 4 steps and up 4 steps to get to the wall.
4. Place the `is` rule next to the wall, creating ""wall is [something].""
5. Then move the `is` rule next to the `you` rule to make ""wall is you.""

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Maybe I need to move the `you` rule instead.

Alternatively, I can try to move the `wall` rule to a different object. The `wall` rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move it to the ball, then the ball becomes a wall, which might block me.

Not helpful. Maybe I can move it to the door, making the door a wall. But that would block me more.

Wait, maybe I can move the `wall` rule to the `stop` rule. Then, ""stop is wall,"" which might make stop signs into walls. Not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move the `win` rule to a closer object.

The `win` rule is at 9 right and 5 up. If I can move it to the key, then the key becomes the win condition. So I just need to reach the key.

But to move the `win` rule, I need to get next to it, which is far away. Maybe I can find a shortcut.

Alternatively, I can try to move the `key` rule to make it something else. The `key` rule is at 7 right and 3 up. If I can make it into a win, then getting the key would win the level.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think.

If I can move the `is` rule next to the key and then next to the `win` rule, I can create ""key is win."" Then, reaching the key would win the level.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the `is` rule at 4 up.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move right 7 steps and up 3 steps to get to the key.
4. Place the `is` rule next to the key, creating ""key is [something].""
5. Then move the `is` rule next to the `win` rule at 9 right and 5 up to make ""key is win.""

But that seems too far. I'm not sure if I can do that without getting blocked by walls.

Maybe I should try to break the rules differently. Let me think about the current rules:

- baba is you (me)
- wall is stop (walls block me)
- win is win (default win condition)
- door is door (default door behavior)
- key is key (default key behavior)

I need to change one of these rules to make progress. Maybe making the door into something else.

If I can make the door into a passable object, like ""door is you,"" then I can walk through it without needing the key.

To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to the door and then next to the `you` rule.

So:

1. Move to the `is` rule at 4 up.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move right 5 steps and up 3 steps to get to the door.
4. Place the `is` rule next to the door, creating ""door is [something].""
5. Then move the `is` rule next to the `you` rule at 1 right and 1 down to make ""door is you.""

Now, the door becomes me, so I can walk through it.

Once I do that, I can go through the door, get the key, and then proceed to the win.

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Let me try to outline the steps clearly.

1. Move up 4 steps to reach the `is` rule.
2. Move right 5 steps and up 3 steps to reach the door.
3. Place the `is` rule next to the door, creating ""door is [something].""
4. Move the `is` rule next to the `you` rule, creating ""door is you.""
5. Now, the door is me, so I can walk through it.
6. Move right to get the key.
7. Use the key to open the door (if needed).
8. Proceed to the win.

But I'm not sure if moving the `is` rule like that will work. Maybe I need to create a new rule instead of moving the existing one.

Alternatively, I can try to move the `you` rule to the door, making the door into me.

So:

1. Move right 1 step and down 1 step to get the `you` rule.
2. Move it to the door's position at 5 right and 3 up.
3. Create ""door is you,"" making the door into me.
4. Now, I can walk through the door.
5. Get the key.
6. Proceed to the win.

This seems more straightforward. Let me try that.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right once and down once to pick up the `you` rule.
2. Move right 4 more steps and up 4 steps to get to the door.
3. Place the `you` rule next to the door, creating ""door is you.""
4. Now, the door is me, so I can walk through it.
5. Move right to get the key.
6. Use the key to open the door (if needed).
7. Proceed to the win.

But I'm not sure if placing the `you` rule next to the door will create the rule correctly. Maybe I need to move the `is` rule instead.

Alternatively, I can try to move the `is` rule to create ""door is you.""

So:

1. Move up 4 steps to get the `is` rule.
2. Move right 5 steps and up 3 steps to get to the door.
3. Place the `is` rule next to the door, creating ""door is [something].""
4. Then move the `is` rule next to the `you` rule to make ""door is you.""

This way, the door becomes me, and I can walk through it.

Once I do that, I can proceed to get the key and win.

I think this is the best approach. So, the first step is to move up 4 steps to get the `is` rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" rule somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 4 steps right and 4 up. Then there are some rules: ""is"" at 8 right and 4 up, ""win"" at 9 right and 4 up. There's another ""wall"" rule 1 left and 3 up, and an ""is"" rule at 3 up. There's a ball 1 right and 3 up, and a wall at 4 right and 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. Then there's a door at 5 right and 2 up, a key at 7 right and 2 up. Walls are also at 4 right and 1 up, 4 right, and 4 right and 1 down. The ""baba"" rule is 1 left and 2 down, ""is"" is 2 down, and ""you"" is 1 right and 2 down. There's also a wall at 4 right and 2 down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to move. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. The key is to manipulate the rules to change the game's behavior. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects or rules.

I notice there's a key at 7 right and 2 up. Maybe I need to get that key to open the door. The door is at 5 right and 2 up. So if I can get the key, I can open the door and maybe reach the win condition.

But how do I get to the key? There are walls in the way. Let me see the path. From my current position, I can move right 4 steps and up 4 steps to get to the wall. But that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can move down to access other areas.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can make some walls passable. Or perhaps I can break the ""stop"" rule to allow movement through walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make Baba able to pass through walls. For example, if I can create a rule like ""baba is pass"" or something, but I don't see a ""pass"" rule here.

Looking at the rules, I see ""baba is you,"" which is the main rule. There's also ""wall is stop"" somewhere, which makes walls stop movement. If I can break that rule, maybe walls won't stop me.

So, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" rule or the ""stop"" rule to change that. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule away from the ""is"" and ""stop"" rule, then walls won't be stop anymore.

Let me see the positions. The ""wall"" rule is 1 left and 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 up. So if I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different position, maybe I can disconnect it from ""is"" and ""stop.""

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location so that it's not associated with walls anymore.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. If I can move it down, maybe it won't affect the walls anymore.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move objects or text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So I need to see if the rules are movable.

In this case, the ""stop"" rule is a text block, so I can move it. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule down to a different location, breaking its association with walls.

Alternatively, I can move the ""wall"" rule to a different location, so that walls are no longer defined as stop.

Let me try to plan the steps. I need to get to the key, which is at 7 right and 2 up. But there are walls in the way. So I need to make those walls passable.

If I can make walls not stop me, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to change the rule ""wall is stop."" So I can move either the ""wall"" or ""stop"" rule to break that association.

Let's say I move the ""stop"" rule down. So I can move it to a position where it's not connected to ""wall is stop."" For example, moving it to the bottom of the screen.

But how do I move it? I need to move the ""stop"" rule, which is at 2 up. So from my current position, I can move up to reach it.

Wait, my current position is where? The observation doesn't specify, but I can assume I'm at the starting point. Let me see the objects again.

The ball is at 1 right and 3 up. The walls are at various positions, but I need to find a path to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push some rules. The ball is at 1 right and 3 up. If I can push the ball to move a rule, that might help.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's simpler to just move the ""stop"" rule.

So, I'll try to move up to reach the ""stop"" rule. Let me see how many steps I need to take.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 up. So if I move up twice, I can reach it. Then, I can move it down to a different location.

Wait, but moving the ""stop"" rule might require me to be adjacent to it. So I need to get next to it.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So if I move left once and up three times, I can reach it.

But that might be a longer path. Maybe it's better to go for the ""stop"" rule.

So, I'll plan to move up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule, then move it down to a position where it's not connected to walls.

Once I've moved the ""stop"" rule, walls won't stop me anymore, and I can walk through them to reach the key.

After that, I can pick up the key, which will allow me to open the door. Then, I can proceed to the win condition.

So, the first step is to move up to reach the ""stop"" rule. Let me try that.
