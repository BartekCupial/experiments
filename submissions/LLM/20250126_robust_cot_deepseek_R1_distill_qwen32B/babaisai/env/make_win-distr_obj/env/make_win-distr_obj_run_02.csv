Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I should check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a rule ""is"" located 1 step right and 2 up. That might be part of another rule.
- The ""win"" rule is 2 right and 2 up. So that's where the win condition is.
- There's a door 1 right and 1 down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or a rule change.
- Another rule ""door"" is 1 right and 2 down. So that's probably defining the door's properties.
- The rule ""baba"" is 3 steps down. That might be another part of a rule.
- Another ""is"" rule is 1 right and 3 down.
- The ""you"" rule is 2 right and 3 down.
- There's a ball 4 right and 3 down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to change rules.

So, the initial rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move Baba. My goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is at 2 right and 2 up. But there's a door in the way at 1 right and 1 down. I need to figure out how to open that door.

Looking at the rules, the door's rule is at 1 right and 2 down. So the rule is probably ""door is something."" If I can change that rule, maybe I can make the door openable.

I think I should move towards the door first. Let me see the path. From my current position, moving right once and down once would take me to the door. But I need to check if I can move there. Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move normally unless something is stopping me.

Wait, the door is at 1 right and 1 down. So if I move right once, I'm at (1,0). Then down once to (1,-1), which is the door. But can I pass through the door? The door's rule is at (1,-2). Let me see what the door's rule is. The rule is ""door is something."" If I can change that, maybe I can make the door open.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule or the ""you"" rule to create a new rule that affects the door. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through.

But how do I do that? I need to move the text blocks to form a new rule. The ""is"" rule is at (1,2), and the ""door"" rule is at (1,-2). If I can move the ""is"" block next to the door, I can create a new rule like ""door is open.""

Wait, but I can only move text blocks that are not ""STOP."" I don't see any ""STOP"" rules here, so I can probably move them.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ""is"" rule at (1,2). From my starting position, I can move up twice to get there. Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""is"" block and move it next to the door.

But wait, can I carry the ""is"" block? In Baba Is You, you can pick up text blocks and move them. So yes, I can move the ""is"" block.

So, step by step:

1. Move up twice to reach the ""is"" rule at (1,2).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move down to the door's position (1,-1).
4. Place the ""is"" block next to the door to form a new rule ""door is open.""

But wait, the door's current rule is at (1,-2). So if I place the ""is"" block at (1,-1), the rule would be ""door is open"" because the door is at (1,-1) and the ""is"" is next to it, and then I need a property. Hmm, maybe I need to have the ""open"" property nearby.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block and another property block next to the door.

Wait, I also see a ""you"" rule at (2,-3) and a ""baba"" rule at (0,-3). Maybe I can use those to create a new rule.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" block to the door's position and then move another block to form ""door is open.""

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to first move towards the door and see if I can manipulate the rules around it.

Wait, another thought: the ball is at (4,-3). Maybe I can use the ball to push something, but I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Let me focus on the door. To open it, I need to change its rule. The current rule is ""door is something."" If I can make it ""door is open,"" then I can pass through.

So, I need to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block and an ""open"" block next to the door. But I don't see an ""open"" block. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by using the existing blocks. For example, if I move the ""is"" block next to the door and then move another block to form ""door is open.""

But I don't see an ""open"" block. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""you"" block. If I make ""door is you,"" then the door would become me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I make ""door is push,"" then I can push it, but I don't see a ""push"" block.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the door open when the ball hits it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""is"" block to the door's position and then move the ""win"" block next to it to make ""door is win,"" but that might not help.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to move towards the door first.

From my starting position, I can move right once to (1,0), then down once to (1,-1), which is the door. But can I pass through? The door's rule is at (1,-2), which is ""door is something."" I need to change that.

So, perhaps I should first move up to get the ""is"" block.

Let me try:

1. Move up once to (0,1).
2. Move up again to (0,2), but wait, the ""is"" block is at (1,2). So I need to move right once from (0,2) to (1,2) to pick up the ""is"" block.

Wait, no. My starting position is (0,0). So moving up once would take me to (0,1), then up again to (0,2). But the ""is"" block is at (1,2). So I need to move right once from (0,2) to (1,2) to pick up the ""is"" block.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it down to the door's position.

So:

3. Move right to (1,2) to pick up ""is.""
4. Move down to (1,1).
5. Move down to (1,0).
6. Move down to (1,-1), which is the door.

Now, placing the ""is"" block next to the door would create a new rule. But I need a property after ""is."" So maybe I can move another block to form ""door is open.""

But I don't see an ""open"" block. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""you"" block.

Wait, the ""you"" block is at (2,-3). If I can move it up to (1,-2), then the rule would be ""door is you,"" making the door into me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can create ""door is win"" by moving the ""win"" block next to the door.

The ""win"" block is at (2,2). So I'd need to move it down to (1,-2), but that's a long way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block and another block to make ""door is open.""

But without an ""open"" block, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the door open when the ball is nearby, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""door is break,"" then I can break it, but I don't see a ""break"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is push,"" but again, no ""push"" block.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the other rules.

The ""baba"" rule is at (0,-3). So if I can move that, maybe I can change my own properties.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (0,-3). If I can move it up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is something else.""

But I'm not sure. Let me try to see if I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule that helps me.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" position to change the win condition.

The ""win"" block is at (2,2). If I can make ""win is something else,"" maybe I can win without going through the door.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to focus on the door first.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" block to the door's position and then find a way to create ""door is open.""

But since I don't have an ""open"" block, maybe I can use the ""you"" block. If I make ""door is you,"" then the door becomes me, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is push"" by moving the ""push"" block, but I don't see one.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. If I can make the door open when the ball is pushed, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the door and then move the ""win"" block next to it to make ""door is win,"" but that might not help.

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""door is nothing,"" then the door would disappear. But I don't see a ""nothing"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is stop,"" but that would make it immovable, which is the opposite of what I want.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block to the door and see what happens.

So, to do that, I need to:

1. Move up twice to (0,2).
2. Move right to (1,2) to pick up ""is.""
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move down to (1,0).
5. Move down to (1,-1), placing the ""is"" block next to the door.

Now, the rule would be ""door is [something]."" But I need to have a property after ""is."" So I need to move another block next to the ""is"" block.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""you"" block to (1,-2), so the rule becomes ""door is you."" That would make the door into me, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" block to (1,-2), making ""door is win,"" but I don't know if that does anything.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" block to (1,-2), making ""door is baba,"" but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block and another block to form ""door is open."" But without an ""open"" block, I can't do that.

Hmm, maybe I need to look for another approach. Let me check the other objects.

There's a ball at (4,-3). Maybe I can use it to push something. If I can make the ball push the door open, but I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key and then use it to open the door, but I don't see a ""key"" block.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the door into a ""win"" condition, then maybe I can win by reaching the door. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to be the ball. But that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""win"" block to the door's position, making the door the win condition. Then, when I reach the door, I win.

But how? Let me see:

1. Move up twice to (0,2).
2. Move right to (1,2) to pick up ""is.""
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move down to (1,0).
5. Move down to (1,-1), placing ""is"" next to the door.
6. Then, move the ""win"" block from (2,2) down to (1,-2), so the rule becomes ""door is win.""

If that works, then the door becomes the win condition. So when I reach the door, I win.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the win condition is still the original ""win"" block, so I need to reach that.

Wait, the original win condition is at (2,2). So if I can change the rule to make the door the win condition, then I can win by reaching the door.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try to open the door instead.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make the door into a ""you"" so that I can pass through it.

Wait, if I make ""door is you,"" then the door becomes me, but I'm not sure if that allows me to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""push"" object, so I can push it open.

But I don't see a ""push"" block. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the door into a ""ball,"" then the ball can push it open. But I don't see a ""ball"" block in the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""stop,"" but that would make it immovable.

Wait, perhaps I can make the door into a ""nothing,"" but I don't see that block.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block to the door and see what happens.

So, let's say I move the ""is"" block to (1,-1), next to the door. Then, I need another block to form the property. If I can move the ""you"" block to (1,-2), then the rule becomes ""door is you,"" making the door into me. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" block to (1,-2), the rule becomes ""door is win,"" which might make the door the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try that.

So, steps:

1. Move up twice to (0,2).
2. Move right to (1,2) to pick up ""is.""
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move down to (1,0).
5. Move down to (1,-1), placing ""is"" next to the door.
6. Now, I need to move another block to (1,-2) to complete the rule.

The ""win"" block is at (2,2). To move it to (1,-2), I need to:

- Move left once to (1,2).
- Move down four times to (1,-2).

But that's a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" block from (2,-3) up to (1,-2).

So:

- Move left once to (1,-3).
- Move up once to (1,-2).

Then, the rule becomes ""door is you,"" making the door into me. But I'm not sure if that allows me to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""push"" object by moving the ""push"" block, but I don't see one.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block to the door and then see if I can form a new rule that allows me to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" block to create a new rule that changes my properties.

The ""baba"" block is at (0,-3). If I can move it up, maybe I can make ""baba is something else.""

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can make the door into a ""win"" condition by moving the ""win"" block next to it. So, the rule would be ""door is win,"" meaning that when I reach the door, I win.

So, to do that:

1. Move up twice to (0,2).
2. Move right to (1,2) to pick up ""is.""
3. Move down to (1,1).
4. Move down to (1,0).
5. Move down to (1,-1), placing ""is"" next to the door.
6. Now, move the ""win"" block from (2,2) to (1,-2).

But moving the ""win"" block that far would take a lot of steps, and I'm not sure if it's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" block to the door's position to make the door the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. The ball is at (4,-3). If I can make the ball into a key, then I can use it to open the door. But I don't see a ""key"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball push the door open. But I don't see a ""push"" block.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the door into a ""ball,"" then the ball can push it open. But I don't see a ""ball"" block in the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a ""nothing,"" but I don't see that block.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to move the ""is"" block to the door and see what happens.

So, I'll move up twice to (0,2), then right to (1,2) to pick up ""is."" Then","

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""rule `win`"" is located two steps to the right and two steps up. That's probably the win condition I need to reach. There's also a door one step to the right and one step down, and a rule block for ""door"" nearby. Additionally, there's a ball further to the right and down.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rule blocks. One is one step to the right and two steps up, another is one step to the right and three steps down. There's also a ""baba"" rule three steps down and a ""you"" rule two steps to the right and three steps down. 

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can't move through objects that are defined as ""STOP"" or similar. I need to see if I can manipulate the rules to change my properties or the environment. Maybe I can move some rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones.

First, I should probably move towards the ""win"" rule to see if I can interact with it. But before that, I should check if there are any obstacles. The door is nearby, but I don't know if it's locked or not. If I can change the door's properties, maybe I can open it or make it passable.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule blocks to create new combinations. For example, if I can place ""baba is win,"" that might make me the win condition, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Or maybe I can make the door into something else.

Wait, the ball is four steps to the right and three steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push some rule blocks into place. But I don't know if the ball is movable or if it has any special properties.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Since I need to reach the ""win"" rule, which is two steps up and two steps right, I should start moving in that direction. But I need to make sure there's a clear path.

Looking at the map, the door is one step right and one step down. If I move right first, I might be able to go around the door. Let me try moving right to see if I can get closer to the ""win"" rule.

So, my first move should be to the right. That way, I can start heading towards the ""win"" rule and possibly interact with other rule blocks along the way.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, but I need to figure out how to get there.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door, a ball, and some rule blocks. The door is one step down from my current position. There's also a rule block that says ""door"" two steps down. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these rules to make the door do something useful.

I notice there's a ball three steps to the right and three steps down. That's pretty far. I wonder if I can use the ball somehow. Maybe if I change the rules to make the ball win or something.

Wait, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and two steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can redefine what wins. But how?

I think the key is to move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""door"" block, I might be able to make the door into something else, like a pushable object or a win condition.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ""is"" block that's two steps up. If I move up twice, I can pick up that ""is"" block. Then, maybe I can move it next to the ""door"" rule to make a new rule like ""door is win."" That way, when I reach the door, it would trigger the win condition.

So, first, I'll move up twice to get the ""is"" block. Then, I'll move down to get back towards the door. Once I have the ""is"" block, I can place it next to the ""door"" rule to create ""door is win."" That should make the door the win condition, so I just need to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. But the ball is farther away, so the door seems more accessible. Plus, the door is only one step down, so it's closer.

I think the best course of action is to move up twice to get the ""is"" block, then move down to position it next to the ""door"" rule. That way, I can create a new rule that makes the door the win condition, and then I can just step on it to win.

Wait, but I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""is"" block isn't a stop, so I should be able to move it.

So, the steps would be: move up twice to get the ""is"" block, then move down to place it next to the ""door"" rule. Then, the door becomes the win condition, and I can step on it to win.

I think that's the plan. Let me try moving up twice first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""rule `is`"" is one step up, which might be important. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. There's a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. Then there's ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down, ""rule `is`"" four steps down, ""rule `you`"" one step to the right and four steps down, and a ball three steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or move these rule blocks. The key is to create or modify rules that will help me win.

First, I should probably move towards the ""rule `win`"" block. If I can move it or change it, I might be able to redefine what the win condition is. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes something else the win condition.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is at one step right and one step up from my current position. So if I move right and up, I can reach it. But I need to make sure I can move there without any obstacles. Let me check the map again.

I also see a door two steps down. Doors usually require a key or some condition to open. The ""rule `door`"" is three steps down, so maybe I can change the door's properties by moving the rule block.

But my main goal is to reach the win condition. So maybe I should focus on moving the ""rule `win`"" block. If I can move it closer or change it, I can set a new win condition.

Alternatively, I could try to make the ball the win condition. If I can create a rule like ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would make me win. That might be a way to bypass any obstacles.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the ""rule `win`"" block. So from my current position, moving right and up should get me there. Once I'm next to it, I can push it or move it to create a new rule.

Wait, but I also have the ""rule `is`"" one step up. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" block next to another object, I can form a new rule.

For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to the ball, I can create ""ball is win."" That would make the ball the win condition, and then I just need to reach the ball.

So, my plan is to move towards the ""rule `is`"" block, which is one step up. Then, I can move it next to the ball, which is three steps to the right and four steps down. But that seems a bit far. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, I can move the ""rule `win`"" block to where the ball is. That way, the win condition becomes the ball's position. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to the ball. Let me try that. So, I need to move the ""is"" block from one step up to where the ball is. That would require moving it three steps to the right and four steps down. That's a lot, but maybe I can do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block to the ball's position. That would make the win condition the ball. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Another idea: if I can make the door the win condition, then opening the door would make me win. But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Wait, let me think about the current win condition. The ""rule `win`"" is at one step right and one step up. So if I can reach that position, I can win. But maybe there's a barrier or something preventing me from getting there directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to something else. For example, if I can make the ball the win condition, then I just need to reach the ball.

So, to do that, I need to create a new rule: ""ball is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the ball. The ""is"" block is one step up, and the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. So I need to move the ""is"" block from one step up to the ball's position.

But moving the ""is"" block that far might be complicated. Maybe there's a shorter path or a way to rearrange the rules to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block to where the ball is. That way, the win condition becomes the ball's position. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, another idea: if I can make the door the win condition, then opening the door would make me win. But I'm not sure if that's easier.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the win condition by moving the ""is"" block next to it. Let me try that.

So, first, I need to move the ""is"" block from one step up to where the ball is. That's three steps to the right and four steps down. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe I can do it step by step.

But I'm not sure if I can move the ""is"" block that far without any obstacles. Let me check the map again.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is one step up, and the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. So, from the ""is"" block, I need to move three steps to the right and four steps down to reach the ball. That's a total of seven steps. That seems a bit too much, but maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block next to another object that's closer. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to the door, I can create a new rule like ""door is win."" Then, opening the door would make me win.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. So, if I can change that rule, I might be able to make the door openable or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door the win condition. So, if I can create a rule like ""door is win,"" then opening the door would make me win.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Let me think about the steps.

First, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the door. The ""is"" block is one step up, and the door is two steps down. So, from my current position, moving down two steps would get me to the door. Then, I can push the ""is"" block down to be next to the door.

Wait, but the ""is"" block is one step up from me. So, if I move up, I can reach it. Then, I can push it down towards the door.

Yes, that makes sense. So, my plan is:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" block.
2. Push the ""is"" block down towards the door.
3. Once the ""is"" block is next to the door, a new rule ""door is win"" is created.
4. Then, I can open the door, which would make me win.

But wait, does the door have any properties? The ""rule `door`"" is three steps down, which might define its properties. If I can change that rule, I might be able to make the door openable.

Alternatively, if I make ""door is win,"" then opening the door would make me win, regardless of its other properties.

So, let's try that.

First, I need to move up to get the ""is"" block. Then, push it down to the door.

So, the first action would be to move up.

But wait, in the previous observation, the ""rule `is`"" was one step up. So, moving up would take me to the ""is"" block. Then, I can push it down.

Yes, that seems like a good plan.

So, the first action is to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""rule `is`"" is one step up, which might be useful for creating new rules. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. There's a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. Then there's ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down, another ""rule `is`"" four steps down, ""rule `you`"" one step to the right and four steps down, and a ball three steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, I think I need to manipulate the rules to change how things work. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or move these rule blocks. Maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through the door or change the win condition.

Let me try to visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, moving up would take me to the ""rule `is`"" block. If I move right and up, I can reach the ""rule `win`"" block. The door is two steps down, so maybe I can get to it by moving down twice. But the door might require a key or a specific rule to open it.

Wait, there's a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what the door does. For example, if I make ""door is open,"" I can pass through it. Alternatively, I could change the win condition to something else if needed.

I also see a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something or change a rule when it's moved. But I'm not sure how yet.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Since I need to reach the win condition, I should probably move towards it. The ""rule `win`"" is one step right and one step up from my current position. If I move right and then up, I can get there. But I need to make sure that moving those blocks doesn't break the current rule or create a new one that helps me.

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the door first. If I can open the door, I might find a shortcut or another rule block that's useful. The door is two steps down, so moving down twice would get me there. But I need to check if the door is passable or if it requires a specific rule.

Wait, the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. If I can move that block, I can change the door's properties. For example, if I make ""door is open,"" I can pass through it without any issues. So maybe I should move towards the ""rule `door`"" block first.

Let me plan my steps. I'm currently at the starting position. If I move down three times, I can reach the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, I can push it to change the door's rule. But I need to make sure I can move it. Since it's a rule block, I can move it as long as it's not fixed.

Alternatively, I could move up to the ""rule `is`"" block and then create a new rule by moving it next to another block. For example, if I move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""rule `win`"" block, I can create a new rule like ""win is something.""

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should focus on the door first. If I can open the door, I might find a way to reach the win condition more easily.

So, I think the best course of action is to move down three times to reach the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, I can push it to change the door's rule. Once the door is open, I can move through it and possibly reach the win condition.

Wait, but moving down three times from my current position would take me to the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, I can push it to the door's position, making ""door is open."" That way, I can pass through the door.

Alternatively, I could move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls or something like that. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the most straightforward approach is to open the door by changing its rule. So, I'll move down three times to get to the ""rule `door`"" block, then push it to the door's position. That should make the door passable.

Wait, but the door is two steps down, and the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. So, if I move down three times, I can pick up the ""rule `door`"" block and move it up one step to the door's position. That would make the door's rule ""door is open,"" allowing me to pass through.

Yes, that makes sense. So, my first move should be to move down three times to reach the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, I can move up once to place it next to the door, changing the rule.

But wait, I can only move one step at a time. So, I need to plan each move carefully. Let me outline the steps:

1. Move down once: Now I'm one step down.
2. Move down again: Now I'm two steps down, at the door's position.
3. Move down a third time: Now I'm three steps down, at the ""rule `door`"" block.

Now, I can pick up the ""rule `door`"" block and move it up one step to the door's position. That would change the door's rule to ""door is open.""

But wait, can I do that in one move? Or do I need to move the block step by step?

I think I can only move one step at a time, so I need to move the ""rule `door`"" block up one step at a time. So, after reaching the ""rule `door`"" block, I can move up once, which would place it next to the door. Then, the door's rule becomes ""door is open,"" and I can pass through.

Once the door is open, I can move through it and possibly reach the win condition or find another rule block that helps me.

Alternatively, maybe I should first check if the win condition is reachable without opening the door. The ""rule `win`"" is one step right and one step up from my current position. If I move right and then up, I can reach it. But I need to see if that's the actual win condition or if it's just a rule block.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is a rule block, so it's not the win condition itself. The win condition is probably another object that I need to reach. So, I need to find where the actual ""WIN"" object is.

Looking back at the objects, I see ""rule `win`"" is one step right and one step up. So, that's the rule block, not the win object. The win object might be elsewhere, or maybe it's defined by the rule.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. The win condition is probably defined by another rule, like ""something is win."" So, I need to find a rule that defines what is win.

Looking at the objects, I don't see a ""rule `win`"" that defines something as win. The ""rule `win`"" is just a block, so maybe I need to create a new rule to define what wins.

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is the ""WIN"" object, which I need to reach. But I don't see it listed in the objects. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, the objects listed are rule blocks and other objects like door, ball, etc. Maybe the win condition is the ""WIN"" object, which is not listed here, or perhaps it's defined by a rule.

I think I need to focus on opening the door first, as that might lead me to the win condition or another rule block that I can use.

So, to recap, I'll move down three times to reach the ""rule `door`"" block, then move it up one step to the door's position, making the door open. Then, I can move through the door and proceed towards the win condition.

But wait, moving down three times from my current position would take me to the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, I can move up once to place it next to the door. That should change the door's rule to ""door is open.""

Yes, that seems like a solid plan. So, my first move is to move down three times, but since I can only move one step at a time, I'll start by moving down once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule two steps up and one to the right. There's also a door one step down and another rule related to the door two steps down. Baba is positioned one step to the left and three steps down. There's another ""is"" rule three steps down and a ""you"" rule one step to the right and three steps down. Oh, and there's a ball three steps to the right and three steps down.

Hmm, I think I need to manipulate the rules to make progress. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change something. If I move the ""is"" rule up, I might be able to create a new rule that helps me. Alternatively, moving the ""win"" rule could change what I need to do to win.

Wait, the door is one step down. If I can make the door open or change its properties, that might help me reach the win. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make the door passable.

I'm a bit confused about how to approach this. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule up to see if that creates a new rule that can help me. Or perhaps moving the ""win"" rule to a different position could change the win condition.

Another thought: if I can make Baba into something else, like a ball, I might be able to roll through obstacles. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best first step is to move the ""is"" rule up to see if that changes any active rules. That might give me a new ability or change the environment in a useful way.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule that's 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door and a ball. The door is 2 steps down, and there's a rule ""door"" 3 steps down. Hmm, maybe the door is blocking something or has a rule that can be changed.

I also see a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. That might be a way to change Baba's properties. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up, and another ""is"" is 4 steps down. Maybe I can move these to create new rules.

The ball is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down. I wonder if the ball can be used somehow, maybe to push or change something.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" rule. Since it's 1 step right and 1 step up, I should try moving in that direction. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles. The door is 2 steps down, so maybe it's not in the way if I go up first.

Wait, if I move up, I might be able to get closer to the ""win"" rule. Let me try moving up first. If that doesn't work, maybe I can adjust the rules by moving the ""is"" or ""door"" rules to create a new path or change the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I should move right to get closer to the ""win"" rule. But I'm not sure if that's the best move. I think moving up first might be safer since it's directly towards the ""win"" rule's position.

I should also consider if moving the ""is"" rule can help. If I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with another word, I might create a new rule that makes the door passable or changes what ""win"" means.

But for now, I'll focus on moving towards the ""win"" rule. So, moving up seems like the best first step.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""win"" rule is located 1 step to the right and 1 step up from my current position. That seems like a good target because if I can reach it, I might win the level. 

But wait, there's also a door 2 steps down. Doors in Baba Is You usually require a key or some way to open them. I don't see a key mentioned here, so maybe the door isn't directly relevant right now. 

The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. That's quite far, but maybe I can use it somehow. The ""is"" rule is 4 steps down, which might be useful for creating new rules. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps down, which is also far. 

There's a ball 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or break things, but I'm not sure how that applies here. 

Since the ""win"" is relatively close, I think moving towards it would be the best first step. I can try moving up to get closer to the ""win"" object. If I move up, I'll be one step closer, which might help me reach it in the next move. 

Alternatively, I could consider moving right to align myself better with the ""win"" object, but moving up seems more direct. I don't see any immediate obstacles, so moving up should be safe. 

I should also keep in mind that manipulating the rules might be necessary, but since the ""win"" is close, I'll focus on reaching it first. If that doesn't work, I can then think about rearranging the rules. 

So, my plan is to move up to get closer to the ""win"" object. That should be the best course of action right now.

But wait, if I move up, will there be any obstacles? The ""is"" rule is 1 step up, so maybe moving up will take me to that rule. If I step on it, does that change anything? Maybe I can use it to create a new rule. 

Alternatively, moving right first might be better. Let me see: moving right once would take me to the position of the ""win"" rule. But I need to check if that's allowed. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" rule. 

I don't see a ""stop"" rule mentioned, so I can probably move around without issues. So, moving right and then up should get me to the ""win"" object. 

Wait, but the ""win"" object is 1 step right and 1 step up. So, if I move right once, I'm at the ""win"" position. Do I need to step on it, or is it just the location? I think stepping on it would trigger the win condition. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new rule to make the win condition something else, but that might complicate things. Since the current win is accessible, I should go for it. 

So, my plan is to move right once to reach the ""win"" object. That should complete the level. 

Wait, but in the previous steps, I tried moving up and down, and it didn't work. Maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let me visualize the map. 

If I'm at the starting position, moving right once would take me to the ""win"" rule. But is that the actual win object? Or is the win object somewhere else? 

Looking back, the ""win"" object is 1 step right and 1 step up. So, I need to move right and up. Maybe I should move up first to get closer. 

But moving up takes me to the ""is"" rule. If I step on that, does it change the rules? Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" block. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move up, I can pick it up and move it somewhere else. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move right first to get closer to the ""win"" object. Let me try that. 

So, I'll move right once. Now, I'm at the position of the ""win"" rule. But I need to reach the ""win"" object, which is 1 step up from there. So, I should move up once. 

But wait, moving up from the ""win"" rule's position would take me to the ""is"" rule. That might not help. Maybe I need to move right again. 

Wait, the ""win"" object is 1 step right and 1 step up from my starting position. So, moving right once and then up once should get me there. 

Let me try that. Move right, then up. That should take me to the ""win"" object and complete the level.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a rule ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. That might be a text block I can move.
- The ""win"" object is 1 step up. So it's directly above me.

I need to figure out how to reach the ""win"" object. It's directly above me, so maybe I can just move up. But wait, are there any obstacles? The door is to the left and down, so maybe it's not blocking me. Let me check the rules again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move as Baba. The ""win"" is up, so moving up should get me to the win condition. But I should also consider if moving other text blocks can change the rules to make it easier.

Wait, the rule `win` is one step up. If I move up, I might be able to interact with it. But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, moving left could let me access the rule `is` and maybe create a new rule that helps me win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 1 step up. That probably means the win condition is somewhere near there. There's also a door 2 steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" 3 steps down. Doors in Baba Is You can be opened if you have the right rules, so maybe I need to manipulate the door's properties.

I see a ""rule `baba`"" 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. That might be defining Baba's properties. There's another ""rule `is`"" 4 steps down, which could be part of another rule. The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps down, and a ""ball"" is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down.

I think the key here is to move the text blocks to create new rules. Since I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP,"" I need to see which ones are movable. The ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" are probably movable because they don't have a ""STOP"" property.

Maybe I should move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me so I can reach it. Alternatively, I could try to change the win condition by moving the ""rule `win`"" to a different location or combining it with another rule.

Wait, if I move the ""rule `win`"" to where the door is, maybe I can make the door the win condition. That could help me progress. Alternatively, I could try to make the ball the win condition if that's easier.

I also notice that the ""rule `door`"" is 3 steps down. If I can move that, I might be able to change how the door behaves. Maybe making the door ""is"" something else could unlock it.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move the ""rule `win`"" to a position where I can reach it. It's currently 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move it closer, I can then step on it to win. Alternatively, I could move the ""rule `is`"" to create a new rule that makes the door passable.

Another idea: if I can make the door ""is"" you, then I can walk through it. But I need to see if that's possible by moving the ""rule `door`"" and ""rule `is`"" together.

I'm a bit confused about the exact positions. Let me visualize the map. Baba is at the starting point. The ""rule `win`"" is up and to the right. The door is down, and the ""rule `door`"" is further down. The ""rule `baba`"" is to the left and down, and the ""rule `is`"" is down.

Maybe I should move the ""rule `is`"" up to combine it with the ""rule `win`"" to create a new rule like ""WIN IS YOU,"" which would make the win condition something I can reach.

Alternatively, moving the ""rule `win`"" to where the door is could make the door the win condition, allowing me to step on it to win.

I think the best approach is to move the ""rule `win`"" closer so I can reach it. Let me try moving it to the right or up to make it accessible.

Wait, if I move the ""rule `win`"" to the right, it would be further away. Maybe moving it up would bring it closer. Alternatively, moving the ""rule `is`"" up to combine with ""rule `win`"" could create a new rule.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think moving the ""rule `win`"" up would help. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule that's one step to the right and one step up from my current position. So, if I move right and up, I should reach the win. But wait, I also see a door two steps down. There's a rule for the door three steps down, which might mean the door is blocking something or has a property that could affect me.

I also notice a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. There are rules for ""is"" and ""you"" positioned in various places. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to change how Baba behaves or what the win condition is.

But right now, the simplest path seems to be moving towards the win. Since the win is one step right and one step up, I should try moving in that direction. Let me check if there are any obstacles. The door is two steps down, so it's not directly in my way. The ball is further down, so it shouldn't interfere with my immediate path.

I think moving up first would be a good idea. That way, I can get closer to the win without dealing with the door or the ball right away. If moving up doesn't work, I can adjust my strategy, maybe by moving right first or dealing with the door if it's blocking something.

So, I'll choose to move up to get closer to the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `win`"" located 1 step to the right and 1 step up. That probably means the win condition is somewhere near there. There's also a door 2 steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" 3 steps down. Doors in Baba Is You can be opened if you have the right rules, so maybe I need to manipulate the door's properties.

The ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. I'm not sure what that does yet. There's another ""rule `is`"" 4 steps down, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `you`"" is 1 step to the right and 4 steps down, and a ball is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or change rules.

I think the key here is to move the text blocks to create new rules. Since I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP,"" I need to see which ones I can move. The ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" are probably movable. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine it with something else to change the win condition or make the door passable.

Let me plan my steps. I need to get closer to the ""rule `win`"" to see if I can change it. Right now, it's 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move up, I can get closer. Then, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""WIN IS DOOR"" or something that allows me to win by opening the door.

Wait, the door is 2 steps down, and the ""rule `door`"" is 3 steps down. If I can make the door openable, I might be able to get through. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the door's position to make it ""DOOR IS OPEN"" or something like that.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""you"" rule to change what I am. If I can make ""YOU IS BALL,"" I might be able to push the ball through the door or something.

But first, I need to get closer. Let me try moving up to get near the ""rule `win`."" Once I'm there, I can see if I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. If I can make ""WIN IS DOOR,"" then opening the door would win the level.

So, my plan is to move up to get near the ""rule `win`,"" then move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition to the door. Once that's done, I can go down to the door and open it to win.

Let me try moving up first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""rule `win`"" is located 1 step to the right and 1 step up from my current position. That seems like the win condition, so I should aim to get there.

But wait, there's also a door 2 steps down. Doors in Baba Is You often require a key or a specific action to open. I don't see a key mentioned, but maybe manipulating the rules can help. There's a ""rule `door`"" 3 steps down, which might define the door's properties. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can change how the door behaves.

The ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. That might be defining Baba's properties. If I move it, could I change what Baba is? Maybe turn Baba into something else to bypass obstacles.

There's also a ""rule `is`"" 4 steps down and another ""rule `you`"" 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. These could be crucial in redefining the rules of the game. If I can move these, I might be able to create new rules that make the level easier.

The ball is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use it to my advantage.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the win condition. It's only 1 step right and 1 step up. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way. Let me check the positions again.

If I move up, I might be able to reach the ""rule `is`"" that's 1 step up. Maybe moving that rule can help me create a new rule that benefits me. Alternatively, moving right could get me closer to the win condition.

Wait, if I move up, I can pick up the ""rule `is`"" and maybe combine it with another rule to create something useful. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win,"" I could make ""win is something"" which might change the win condition.

Alternatively, moving right towards the win might be the straightforward approach. But I need to ensure that there are no doors or other blocks in the way. The door is 2 steps down, so it's not directly in my path if I go up or right.

I think the best course of action is to move up first to access the ""rule `is`"" and see if I can manipulate the rules to make the level easier. Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can look for other rules to combine it with.

So, I'll choose to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""rule `is`"" is one step up, and the ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. There's also a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. The ""rule `baba`"" is one step to the left and four steps down, and another ""rule `is`"" is four steps down. The ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and four steps down. There's also a ball three steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to reach the win condition. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around to collect or move other rule blocks. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving a subject and a property together.

Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, moving up would take me to the ""rule `is`"" block. If I move right and up, I can reach the ""rule `win`"" block. But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.

I notice that the door is two steps down. Maybe I need to open the door to reach the win condition. But to open the door, I might need to change the rules so that the door can be moved or that I can pass through it.

Looking at the ""rule `door`"" three steps down, perhaps I can move that to change the door's properties. If I can make the door ""is"" something else, like ""open"" or ""passable,"" that might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make the ball the win condition, then reaching the ball would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Each move will take me one step in that direction. I need to plan a sequence of moves that will allow me to manipulate the rules effectively.

If I move up, I can pick up the ""rule `is`"" block. Then, if I move right and up, I can place it next to the ""rule `win`"" block, creating a new rule like ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do.

Alternatively, moving down towards the door might be more straightforward. If I can get to the door, maybe I can change its rule to make it passable. But I need to figure out how to do that.

Wait, the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. If I can move that rule block, I can redefine what the door is. For example, if I place ""door is open,"" then the door would become openable.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, and any rule blocks that are not fixed.

Let me try to move towards the door. If I move down twice, I'll reach the door. But is the door blocking my path? If the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" then I can't pass through it. So I need to change that.

To change the door's rule, I need to move the ""rule `door`"" block. It's three steps down. So if I move down three times, I can reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else to redefine the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining different blocks. For example, if I move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the door, I can make ""door is something.""

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is one step up. If I move up, I can pick it up. Then, moving down three steps would take me to the door's rule. Placing the ""is"" block next to the door's rule could create a new rule.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try to move the ""rule `win`"" block to change the win condition. If I can make the ball the win condition, then reaching the ball would win the level.

The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. If I move right and up, I can pick it up. Then, moving it next to the ball would make ""ball is win,"" which would mean reaching the ball wins the level.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe the original win condition is still in place, and I just need to reach it. Let me check the objects again. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up, so it's a separate rule block. The actual win object might be elsewhere.

Wait, in the objects list, I don't see a separate ""win"" object, just the ""rule `win`"" block. So maybe the win condition is defined by that rule. If I can reach the ""rule `win`"" block, perhaps that's how I win.

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is to reach the ball, which is three steps to the right and four steps down. But I'm not sure.

I think the best approach is to try to move towards the door and see if I can change its rule to make it passable. If I can get through the door, I might find the win condition on the other side.

So, I'll start by moving down twice to reach the door. But if the door is a stop, I can't pass through it. So I need to change its rule first.

To change the door's rule, I need to move the ""rule `door`"" block, which is three steps down. So I'll move down three times to reach it. Then, I can move it somewhere else to redefine the door.

Once I've moved the ""rule `door`"" block, I can place it next to another block to create a new rule. For example, if I place it next to the ""rule `is`"" block, I can make ""door is something.""

But I'm not sure what to make the door. Maybe ""door is open"" or ""door is passable."" Alternatively, I could make the door the win condition.

Wait, if I make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. That might be a good strategy.

So, I'll move down three times to get the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, I'll move it next to the ""rule `win`"" block, which is one step to the right and one step up. Placing ""door"" next to ""win"" would create the rule ""door is win.""

Once that rule is active, the door becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the door to win the level.

But wait, the door is two steps down. If I can make it the win condition, then I can just move down twice to win. That seems efficient.

So, the plan is:

1. Move down three times to reach the ""rule `door`"" block.
2. Pick up the ""rule `door`"" block.
3. Move up one step and right one step to reach the ""rule `win`"" block.
4. Place the ""rule `door`"" block next to ""rule `win`"" to create ""door is win.""
5. Now, the door is the win condition.
6. Move down twice to reach the door and win the level.

Let me double-check the steps. Starting position, move down three times: down, down, down. Then, move up once and right once to place the ""door"" next to ""win."" Then, move down twice to the door.

Yes, that should work. So the first action is to move down.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. The ""win"" rule is located 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from my current position. The door is 1 step down, and there's a rule block defining ""door"" 2 steps down. There's also a ""baba"" rule 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, an ""is"" rule 3 steps down, a ""you"" rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps down, and a ball 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down.

Hmm, so I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change it somehow. But wait, the ""win"" rule is already defined as ""WIN,"" so I might need to reach it directly.

Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting point, moving up twice would take me to the ""is"" rule. Moving right once and up twice would take me to the ""win"" rule. But I need to check if there are any obstacles or if I can move freely.

The door is 1 step down, but there's a rule block defining ""door"" 2 steps down. Maybe the door is blocking my path, but since I'm Baba, I can push it if it's movable. Wait, the door's rule is ""door,"" which might mean it's a regular door, but without additional properties, it might just be a block I can move.

I also see a ball 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Balls in Baba Is You usually roll, so maybe I can use it to trigger something or move it to create a new rule.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. If I move up twice, I'll reach the ""is"" rule. If I move right once and up twice, I'll reach the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure that the path is clear.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So from my current position, moving right once and up twice should get me there. But I need to check if there are any objects in the way. The door is 1 step down, so it's below me, not in the path to the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I should move down to interact with the door or other rules. If I move down once, I'll be next to the door. Then, moving left or right could allow me to push it or use it somehow.

But my main goal is to reach the ""win"" rule. So moving up twice and right once seems like the direct path. Let me try that.

Wait, but the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So from my current position, moving up twice and then right once would take me there. Alternatively, moving right once and then up twice. I need to make sure the movement is possible.

I think moving up twice first would be safer, as it gets me closer to the ""win"" rule. Then, moving right once would take me to the ""win"" rule. That should complete the level.

Alternatively, if the ""win"" rule is not directly reachable, I might need to rearrange other rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I need to change that.

To change the rule, I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" But that might require more steps.

Given the current setup, I think the quickest way is to move towards the ""win"" rule directly. So, moving up twice and then right once should do it.

Wait, but the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So from my current position, moving up twice would take me to the ""is"" rule, and then moving right once would take me to the ""win"" rule. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if I move right once and then up twice, I might end up next to the ""win"" rule. Let me confirm the positions.

If I'm at (0,0), moving right once takes me to (1,0). Then moving up twice takes me to (1,2), which is where the ""win"" rule is. Yes, that makes sense.

So, the plan is to move right once and then up twice. But since I can only choose one action at a time, I need to decide the first step. Moving right once would be the first step towards reaching the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, moving up twice first would also work, but I think moving right first is more direct.

Wait, no, moving up twice first would take me to (0,2), and then moving right once would take me to (1,2), which is the ""win"" rule. So both approaches work, but I need to choose the first action.

I think moving up twice first is better because it gets me closer vertically, and then I can move right. But since I can only choose one action, I'll choose to move up twice first.

Wait, but the action options are only single steps. So I can't move up twice in one action. I need to choose one direction to move in. So, perhaps moving up once, then again, but since I can only choose one action, I need to pick the best first step.

Alternatively, maybe moving right once is better to start, as it aligns me horizontally with the ""win"" rule.

I think moving right once is the better first step because it positions me correctly to then move up twice to reach the ""win"" rule.

So, the first action should be to move right once.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `win` 2 step up."" So the win condition is two steps up from where? I think it's relative to the starting position. Also, there's a door two steps down, and a ball three steps down and two steps to the right.

I need to figure out how to move the text blocks to change the rules. The rules are formed by ""rule"" objects followed by some text. For example, ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"" probably means that the ""is"" rule is positioned one step to the left and two steps up from somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should visualize the map. Let me sketch it out mentally. The starting point is where Baba is. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and two steps up. The ""win"" rule is two steps up. The door is one step to the left and one step down. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and two steps down. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and three steps down. The ""is"" rule again is one step to the left and three steps down. The ""you"" rule is three steps down. The ball is two steps to the right and three steps down.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position, I can change what counts as winning. Alternatively, I could try to make Baba into something else by rearranging the rules.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba. So maybe I can move Baba to where the ""win"" rule is. But how? I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball, then the ball becomes the win condition.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move the ""win"" rule to the ball. The ball is two steps to the right and three steps down. The ""win"" rule is two steps up. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down and to the right.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP."" I don't see a ""STOP"" rule here, so maybe I can move the ""win"" rule. Let me try to move it.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is two steps up. So if I move up twice, I can reach it. Then, I can move it to the ball's position. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then Baba becomes the win condition, and I can just stand on myself to win.

But how do I do that? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one at 1 step to the left and 2 steps up, and another at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down.

If I move the ""is"" rule from 1 step left and 2 steps up to between ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win."" That might work.

So, the plan is: move the ""is"" rule from 1 step left and 2 steps up to the position between ""baba"" and ""win."" Then, the rule becomes ""baba is win,"" meaning Baba is the win condition. Then, I just need to stand on myself to win.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from its current position. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So from my starting position, I need to move left once and up twice to reach it.

Wait, but I'm Baba, so I can move around. Let me try to move left once and up twice to pick up the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it to the desired position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball. The ball is two steps right and three steps down. The ""win"" rule is two steps up. So I need to move it down five steps and right two steps. That seems complicated.

I think the first approach is better. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule to make ""baba is win."" So, I'll move left once and up twice to get the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the position between ""baba"" and ""win.""

Wait, but how do I know where ""baba"" and ""win"" are? ""Baba"" is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. ""Win"" is two steps up. So, the position between them would be somewhere in the middle.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form the new rule.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule first. Let me try to move left once and up twice to get the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it to the position where ""baba"" is, making ""baba is win.""

Wait, but ""baba"" is already ""you."" So if I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by standing on myself. That sounds good.

So, the steps are: move left once, up twice to get the ""is"" rule. Then, move it to the position where ""baba"" is, which is two steps left and three steps down. But that's where ""baba"" is, so maybe I can just place the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule that's two steps up. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe another rule. There's a ""door"" rule three steps down, which might mean that the door has some property defined there.

I see a ""baba"" rule four steps down and to the left. That might be another Baba object or a rule that affects Baba. There's also a ""you"" rule four steps down and to the right, which could change what ""you"" is. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down, which might be a collectible or something that affects the rules when moved.

Hmm, maybe I should move towards the ""win"" rule first. It's two steps up, so I can try moving up twice. But wait, if I move up, will I hit any obstacles? The door is two steps down, so moving up shouldn't interfere with that. Let me try moving up once, then again. If that doesn't work, maybe I need to adjust the rules by moving some text blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the rules to make the door passable or to redefine what ""win"" means. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position or change it to something else, that might help. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best first step is to move towards the ""win"" rule. Let me try moving up once. If that doesn't get me closer, I'll reconsider my approach.

I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects or rearrange rules. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change it. But how?

Let me think about the possible actions: idle, up, right, down, left. I need to choose one. If I move up, I might reach the ""win"" rule. But if I move down, I might interact with the door or other rules. Moving left or right could help me access other parts of the map.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. If I move up, I might trigger it and win the level. But I should check if there are any obstacles. The door is two steps down, but I don't know if it's blocking my path. Maybe I need to open it first.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules by moving the ""is"" or ""you"" rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" it might create a new rule like ""win is something."" But I'm not sure.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule that's one step up. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door and a ball. Doors usually require something to open them, and balls can be pushed around.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So, the door is located there. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down, which is where Baba is. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, so that's where I am in relation to Baba.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Hmm, maybe I can push the ball to do something. But how?

I need to figure out how to move. The available actions are idle, up, right, down, left. I think I should move towards the win object. Since the win is one step up, maybe I can move up. But wait, I'm at four steps down, so moving up would take me closer.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules. If I can move the ""is"" rule, I might change the properties of objects. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through it.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? It's one step to the left and one step up. So, if I move left and up, I might be able to grab it. But I'm not sure if I can carry it or just move it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not defined as ""stop."" So, if ""is"" is an object, I can move it. Let me try moving left and up to get to the ""is"" rule.

If I move left once, I'll be at one step left and four steps down. Then, moving up once would take me to one step left and three steps down. That's where the ""door"" rule is. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to change the door's properties.

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the ball. The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. If I can push it, perhaps it can help me reach the win or open the door.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The win is one step up, so if I can get there, I win. But maybe there's a barrier. The door is one step to the left and two steps down. Maybe I need to open the door to reach the win.

To open the door, I might need to change the rule. If I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule and the ""open"" rule together. But I don't see an ""open"" rule here.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule. If I move the ""is"" rule next to the door, I can form ""door is something."" But I'm not sure what that something would be.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, which is where I am. If I move it, I might change my own properties.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at four steps down. The win is one step up from my current position. The door is one step to the left and two steps down. The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down.

If I move up once, I'll be at three steps down. Then, moving up again would take me to two steps down, and so on until I reach the win. But is there something blocking me? The door is to the left, so maybe I need to go around.

Wait, the ball is to the right. Maybe I can push it to the right to create a path. If I move right twice, I'll be next to the ball. Then, I can push it further to the right, maybe creating space.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me try moving up first. If I move up, I might reach the win directly. Let's try that.

So, I'll choose the ""up"" action to move closer to the win.

There's an ""is"" rule four steps down, which could be part of another rule I can manipulate. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, which is probably defining what ""you"" is. And there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or change the environment.

Hmm, I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the door openable or to change the win condition. Maybe if I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change it to something else, I can win without going through the door.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. If I move up, I might reach it. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""door"" rule to make the door openable by Baba.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. If I move up, I might reach the ""win"" rule. But I'm not sure if that's the correct move. Maybe I should move left to access the ""baba"" rule or the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, moving down could help me reach the door or the other rules. But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should try moving up first to see if I can trigger the win condition.

Wait, if I move up, I might reach the ""win"" rule, which could end the level. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution. Maybe the door is the actual way to win, and I need to manipulate the rules to open it.

There's another ""is"" rule four steps down, which could be part of another rule set. And a ""you"" rule four steps down, which might affect how I'm controlled. Oh, and a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to trigger things.

So, my initial thought is to move up to reach the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure there's a clear path. If moving up is blocked, maybe I need to rearrange some rules. For example, if I can make the door open by changing its rule, I might be able to access a new area.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the ""baba"" rule to change my properties, allowing me to pass through obstacles. Or perhaps moving the ""is"" rule could change how other objects behave.

I should also consider if moving the ball could help. Maybe pushing the ball into a certain position can trigger a rule change or open a path.

Wait, if I move left, I can get closer to the ""baba"" and ""door"" rules. Maybe repositioning those could create a new rule that helps me win. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" I might be able to pass through.

But I'm not sure if moving left is the best first step. Maybe moving up first to see if I can reach the win directly. If that's blocked, then I'll need to adjust the rules.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I can move that rule or combine it with something else, I can make the door openable. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That might be a way to duplicate Baba or change properties.

The ""is"" rule is in a few places, which could be used to create new rules. There's also a ""you"" rule four steps down, which might affect how I'm controlled. And a ball two steps to the right and four steps down—maybe that's a collectible or something that can be used to push other objects.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the door openable. If I can move the ""door"" rule to be ""door is open"" or something, then I can pass through. Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball push the door open.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up to combine it with the ""win"" rule. If I can make ""win is you,"" then maybe I can win by being somewhere else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, moving the ""door"" rule to be ""door is open"" might help.

Wait, if I move the ""door"" rule to be next to ""is,"" I can create a new rule like ""door is open."" That would make the door passable. So I need to move the ""door"" rule up or somewhere to connect it with ""is.""

Looking at the positions, the ""door"" rule is three steps down. If I move up from there, maybe I can place it next to an ""is"" rule. Let me try moving up from the ""door"" rule's position.

After moving up, the ""door"" rule would be two steps down. Now, if I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to it, I can form ""door is open."" That should make the door openable.

Once the door is open, I can go through it and reach the ""win"" condition. Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used to push the door open if I set it up correctly.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up. So if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, maybe a key or another rule. There's a ""door"" rule three steps down, so maybe that's related.

I see a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to trigger things. There's also another ""is"" rule four steps down, which might be useful for creating new rules.

Hmm, the ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can move that to change the rules. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, so perhaps moving that could change what ""you"" is.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the door openable or to change the win condition. Maybe if I move the ""door"" rule to be ""door is open,"" the door will open. Alternatively, I could try to make the ball into a key or something that can open the door.

Let me try moving the ""door"" rule. If I move it up, maybe I can combine it with another rule. Wait, I can only move text blocks that aren't ""stop."" So I need to see if the ""door"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, I can probably move it.

If I move the ""door"" rule up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""door is open."" That would make the door passable. Alternatively, I could move the ""is"" rule to create a new property for the door.

Another idea: if I move the ""baba"" rule to a different position, maybe I can change what Baba is. For example, making Baba into a key or something that can open the door.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. If I can get Baba to that position, maybe I can win immediately. But there's a door blocking the way. So I need to open the door first.

Let me plan the steps. First, move towards the ""door"" rule to change it. Then, create a rule that makes the door open. Once the door is open, I can go through it and reach the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without going through the door. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

I think the best approach is to manipulate the door rule to make the door openable. So I'll move towards the ""door"" rule and try to create a new rule there.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is three steps down. I'm currently at the starting position. So I need to move down three times to reach it. But there's a door two steps down. Maybe I can go around or find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the door open. For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to the door to make ""door is open.""

Let me try that. I'll move down to the ""is"" rule, then move it next to the door. That should create a new rule, making the door open.

Once the door is open, I can go through it and reach the ""win"" rule. So the steps would be: move down to the ""is"" rule, then move it to the door's position, creating ""door is open."" Then, move through the door and up to the ""win"" rule.

I think that's the plan. Let me try moving down to the ""is"" rule first.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule that's two steps up. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe manipulating the rules.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I can move that rule, I can change what the door does. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change Baba's properties.

The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. The ""you"" rule is three steps down, which might be useful for changing who I control. There's also a ball three steps to the right and three steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to trigger things.

Hmm, I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to make the door openable or to change the win condition. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to make it ""door is open"" or something like that. Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer or change it to something else.

Let me plan my steps. First, I need to get to the ""is"" rule that's one step to the left and three steps down. If I can move that, I can create a new rule. Maybe I can combine it with the ""door"" rule to make the door openable.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. I need to move towards the ""is"" rule. Let me see: to get to the ""is"" rule, I need to move left once and up twice. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, maybe I should go towards the ""win"" rule first.

If I move up twice, I'll reach the ""win"" rule. But I don't know if that's the win condition yet. Maybe I should check if moving there does something. Alternatively, moving towards the door might be necessary to progress.

I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""is"" rule to see if I can create a new rule that helps me. Let me try moving left once and up twice to get to the ""is"" rule. Once there, I can try to move it to create a new rule, like ""door is open.""

Wait, but I can only move text blocks that aren't ""STOP"" or similar. I think ""is"" is movable. So, moving the ""is"" rule to combine with ""door"" might make ""door is open,"" which would allow me to pass through the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change Baba's properties. If I can make ""baba is push,"" then I can push the ball or other objects.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the door openable. So, I'll move left once and up twice to get to the ""is"" rule, then move it to the position of the ""door"" rule to create ""door is open.""

Wait, but I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" rule without getting stuck. Let me visualize the map. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down from my current position. So, to get there, I need to move left once and down three times. But that might take me away from the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up twice to reach the ""win"" rule first. If I can move the ""win"" rule, I might change the win condition to something easier.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that helps me open the door. Let me try moving left once and down three times to get to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move it to the door's position to make ""door is open.""

Wait, but moving down three times might take me too far. Let me check the positions again. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So, from my current position, I need to move left once and down three times. That would place me at the ""is"" rule's location.

Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to the ""door"" rule's position, which is one step to the left and two steps down. So, after picking up ""is,"" I can move left once and down two times to place it next to ""door,"" creating ""door is open.""

That should make the door passable. Once the door is open, I can go through it and reach the ""win"" condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a more accessible location. The ""win"" rule is two steps up. If I can move it down, I might make it easier to reach.

But I think opening the door is the priority. So, I'll proceed with moving the ""is"" rule to create ""door is open.""

Wait, but I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" rule without any obstacles. Let me see: moving left once and down three times. Is there a clear path? I don't see any stops, so I think it's possible.

Once I've created ""door is open,"" the door should become passable. Then, I can move down to go through the door and reach the ""win"" condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move up to the ""win"" rule and see if that works. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

I think the safest bet is to manipulate the door to open it, so I can progress further. So, I'll move left once and down three times to get the ""is"" rule, then move it to the door's position to create ""door is open.""

After that, I can move down to go through the door and reach the ""win"" condition.

Wait, but I'm not sure if moving the ""is"" rule will work as intended. Maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps moving the ""baba"" rule to give myself a new ability, like ""baba is push,"" which would allow me to push the ball or other objects.

The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and three steps down. So, I can move left twice and down three times to get there. Then, I can move it to create a new rule, like ""baba is push.""

That might help me push the ball to reach the ""win"" condition or open the door.

Alternatively, I could move the ""you"" rule to change who I control, but that might complicate things.

I think the best approach is to either open the door or gain the ability to push objects. Since the door seems like a barrier, opening it would likely be necessary.

So, I'll proceed with moving the ""is"" rule to create ""door is open."" Let's see how that works.

First, I'll move left once and down three times to reach the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the door's position, which is one step to the left and two steps down from my current position.

After placing ""is"" next to ""door,"" the rule becomes ""door is open,"" which should make the door passable.

Once the door is open, I can move down through it and reach the ""win"" condition, which is two steps up from my current position. Wait, no, the ""win"" rule is two steps up from the starting point. So, after opening the door, I might need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" condition is inside the door. So, after opening the door, I can move down through it and reach the ""win"" condition.

I think that's the plan. So, my first move is to move left once and down three times to get the ""is"" rule.

The ""win"" is two steps up, so if I move up twice, I should get there. But wait, is there anything blocking me? The door is one step down, so it's below me. Maybe I can move up without issues.

Alternatively, maybe I should manipulate the rules first. If I can change what ""win"" is, I might have a different goal. But I'm not sure. The ""door"" rule is two steps down, so if I move down twice, I might be able to interact with it. Maybe the door is blocking the way to the win, so I need to open it.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is one step left and three steps down. If I move left once and down three times, I might be able to change the Baba's properties. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now. I think the simplest approach is to move towards the ""win"" rule.

So, I'll try moving up twice. Let me see if that works. If I move up once, I get closer, and then up again to reach the ""win"" position. That should trigger the win condition, right? I think that's the best course of action.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule that's one step up. So, if I can move up, I might reach the win. But wait, there are other rules too. There's a door, and some other rules about ""is"" and ""you."" I need to figure out how these rules interact.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. Hmm, doors usually require something to open them, but I'm not sure how that works here. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make the door openable or something.

There's also a ""ball"" object two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push things or change the environment. Maybe I can use the ball to move a rule block or something.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. That's where Baba is located. So, I need to move Baba towards the win. But the win is only one step up. If I move up from Baba's position, will I reach the win? Let me check the positions.

Baba is at (let's say) position (x, y). The win is one step up from there, so (x, y-1). But I need to make sure there's no obstacle. The door is one step to the left and two steps down from the win. So, the door is at (x-1, y+2). That might be a problem if it's blocking the way.

Wait, the door's rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So, maybe the door is at (x-1, y+3). I'm getting a bit confused with the steps. Let me visualize the map.

If I'm at Baba's position, moving up once should take me to the win. But maybe the door is in the way. Or perhaps the door needs to be opened first. How do I open the door? In Baba Is You, doors usually require a key or a specific rule change.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""door"" rule that's one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe I need to move that rule to change how the door behaves. If I can move the ""door"" rule, I might be able to make the door openable or remove it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push the door or another rule block. The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. If I can move the ball to the door's position, perhaps it can trigger something.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. That's near the win. Maybe moving that rule can change the win condition or make the win accessible.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The win is one step up. If I move up, will I win? Or is there something blocking me?

If I move up, I might reach the win immediately. Let me try that. So, the action would be ""up."" But I need to make sure that moving up doesn't lead to any negative consequences, like falling or getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the rules first. For example, if I can make ""door is open"" or something, then I can pass through. But I don't see a rule for that. Maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""door"" blocks.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I move that ""is"" block to the door's position, maybe I can create a new rule like ""door is open."" That could help me pass through the door if it's blocking the win.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to move Baba to where the ""is"" block is. The ""is"" block is one step to the left and one step up from Baba. So, if I move left and up, I can reach it. But moving left might take me away from the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. If I move that, perhaps I can change the door's properties.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to just move up to the win. Let me try that. If that doesn't work, I'll think of another strategy.

If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" object. But does that mean I win? Or is there a rule that changes the win condition? The active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so I think reaching ""win"" is the goal.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a door and a ball. The door is two steps down and one to the left. There's also a rule for the door: ""door is something"" three steps down and one to the left. Hmm, I think that rule might define the door's properties. If I can manipulate that, maybe I can change how the door behaves.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of the solution. There are also multiple ""is"" rules scattered around, which could be used to create new rules by moving them.

I need to figure out how to move these rules. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up text blocks to change the rules. The key is to create a new rule that helps me reach the win. Maybe I can make Baba able to push the ball or something.

Wait, the door is in the way. If I can make the door open or change its property, that might help. Let me see, the door's rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change it to ""door is open"" or something like that.

But how do I get there? I'm currently at the starting position. Let me plan my moves. I need to go up to get to the ""is"" rule that's one step left and one up. If I move up, I can pick up that ""is"" and maybe create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I should go left first to reach the door's rule. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Each move is one step.

If I move up, I can get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, maybe I can move left to pick it up. Once I have the ""is,"" I can place it somewhere else to create a new rule. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""win,"" I can make ""win is something"" to change the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on the door first. If I can make the door open, I can pass through it. To do that, I might need to change the door's rule. Let me see, the door's rule is at 1 left and 3 down. I need to get there, but that's a bit far.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba able to push the ball. If I can push the ball into the door, maybe it will open. The ball is two right and four down, so I need to get there. But that's a long way.

Wait, maybe I can make the ball into a win condition. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. That could be a shortcut. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. The ""win"" rule is one step up. So if I can move it down and to the right, I can place it next to the ball.

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to pick it up. To pick it up, I have to be adjacent to it. So I need to move up to get next to the ""win"" rule. Once I have it, I can carry it to the ball's location.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move up to get next to the ""is"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right and down to the ball's position.
4. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ball to create ""ball is win.""

But wait, I might need to adjust the exact positions. Let me visualize the map. The ""win"" rule is one step up from my starting position. The ball is two steps right and four down. So I need to move up, then right and down.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. If I can make ""door is win,"" then going through the door would win the level. That might be easier since the door is closer.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door. The door is one left and two down. So I need to move left and down to get there.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should try making the ball into a win condition first. Let me try that.

So, I'll move up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move right and down to the ball. Once there, I'll place the ""is"" next to the ball to make ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to go to the ball to win.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the ""win"" rule is correctly placed. Maybe I should first move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position. Let me see:

1. Move up to get next to the ""is"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right twice and down four times to get to the ball.
4. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ball to create ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if that's the exact path. Maybe I need to adjust the steps. Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a pushable object. If I can push the ball into the door, it might open.

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to create a rule like ""ball is push."" To do that, I need to move the ""push"" rule next to the ball. But I don't see a ""push"" rule on the map. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use the existing rules. The ""baba"" rule is two left and four down. If I can change that, maybe I can make Baba have a different property.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a passable object. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is pass,"" then I can walk through it.

To do that, I need to get to the door's rule, which is one left and three down. So I need to move left and down three times. But that's a bit far. Let me see if I can get there.

1. Move left once.
2. Move down three times.

But I'm not sure if that's the right path. Maybe I should try to make the ball into a win condition first.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a key. If I can make ""ball is key,"" then I can use it to open the door. But I don't see a ""key"" rule on the map.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to ""win,"" I can make ""ball is win."" That way, touching the ball will win the game.

So, let me try that approach. I'll move up to get the ""is"" rule, then move right and down to the ball, and place the ""is"" next to it. Then, I'll move the ""win"" rule next to the ball as well to make ""ball is win.""

But I'm not sure if I can carry both rules. Maybe I can only carry one at a time. So I'll have to do it in steps.

First, I'll move up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move right and down to the ball and place the ""is"" next to it. Now, the ball has ""is"" next to it, but I need to make it ""ball is win."" So I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ball.

To do that, I'll have to go back up to get the ""win"" rule, then move right and down to the ball. But that might take too many steps, and I'm not sure if it's the most efficient way.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a win condition. If I can make ""door is win,"" then going through the door will win the game. That might be quicker since the door is closer.

So, I'll move left once and down two times to get to the door. Then, I'll pick up the ""is"" rule that's next to the door and place it next to ""win."" Wait, no, the ""win"" rule is one step up. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door.

But I'm not sure. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to make the ball into a win condition first.

Let me try moving up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move right twice and down four times to get to the ball. Once there, I'll place the ""is"" next to the ball to make ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to go to the ball to win.

But I'm not sure if that's the exact path. Maybe I need to adjust the steps. Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a pushable object. If I can push the ball into the door, it might open.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so maybe that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can make the door into a passable object. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is pass,"" then I can walk through it. To do that, I need to get to the door's rule, which is one left and three down.

So, I'll move left once and down three times. Then, I'll pick up the ""is"" rule and place it next to ""pass"" or something. But I don't see a ""pass"" rule. Maybe I need to create it.

So, I'll move left once and down two times to get to the door. Then, I'll pick up the ""is"" rule and place it next to ""win."" Wait, no, the ""win"" rule is one step up. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules around. I need to figure out how to get to the win.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. There's also a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down, and another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, and a ball is two steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the properties. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door, maybe I can make the door openable or something. Or perhaps I need to create a new rule by moving the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. But I'm not sure how that would help. Let me think about the movement.

I'm currently at a position where the ""win"" is one step up. If I move up, I might reach the win. But is there anything blocking me? The door is one step to the left and two steps down. Maybe I need to open the door first.

But how do I open the door? The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe if I move the ""is"" rule next to the door, I can make it open. Or perhaps I need to change the door's property.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change my own properties. If I can make Baba into something else, maybe I can pass through the door or reach the win directly.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to something else, maybe I can change what ""you"" is. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and the win is up. The door is to the left and down. There are several rules scattered around. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to pass through the door.

If I move the ""is"" rule one step to the left and one step up, that's where the ""is"" rule is already. Maybe I need to move it elsewhere. If I move it next to the door, perhaps I can make the door into something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change my own properties. If I can make Baba into a different object, maybe I can pass through the door or reach the win.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can push the ball to create a new rule. But I'm not sure how that would help.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to win without going through the door. Or perhaps I can make the door into a win condition.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up to the ""win"" rule. If I can make ""win is something,"" maybe I can change the win condition.

Wait, no, the ""win"" rule is already one step up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door to make it into a win condition. So, if I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the door. The door is one step to the left and three steps down. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule there.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move it if it's not fixed. Since it's a rule, maybe I can move it by pushing it with another object.

Wait, I'm Baba, and I can move around. If I can get next to the ""is"" rule, I can push it. Let me see where the ""is"" rule is. It's one step to the left and one step up from my current position. So, if I move left and up, I can reach it.

Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can push it down towards the door. The door is three steps down from the ""is"" rule's original position. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule down three steps.

After moving the ""is"" rule next to the door, the new rule would be ""door is win."" Then, stepping on the door would trigger the win condition.

So, the plan is: move left, up to get next to the ""is"" rule, then push it down three steps to the door's position. Then, move to the door to win.

But wait, moving the ""is"" rule might require multiple steps. Let me break it down.

1. Move left to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Move up to get next to it.
3. Push the ""is"" rule down three times to place it next to the door.
4. Then, move to the door to win.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule in one step if possible. But I think it requires moving it step by step.

Another thought: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on the win rule would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule, I can make ""baba is win."" Then, stepping on the win rule would win the level.

But that might be more complicated. I think the first plan is better.

So, to summarize, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the door to make ""door is win,"" then step on the door to win.

Let me try to execute that step by step.

First, move left to reach the ""is"" rule. Then, move up to get next to it. Then, push it down three times to place it next to the door. Finally, move to the door to win.

I think that's the way to go.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules that might affect how I can move or what I can do.

I see a door one step to the left and two steps down. There's also a rule ""door"" one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe that door has some special property because of that rule. If I can manipulate the rules, I might be able to change how the door behaves or how I can interact with it.

There's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down, and another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Also, a ""you"" rule four steps down. These might be important for changing the rules or creating new ones.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it can be used to push something or change a rule.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" object since that's the goal. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles or necessary rule changes to get there. Let me check the positions again.

If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" rule directly. But I should also consider if moving in other directions can help me set up the rules better. For example, moving left might allow me to interact with the door or the other rules.

Wait, if I move left, I can get closer to the door and the other rules. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the door passable or change what ""win"" means. But since the ""win"" is just one step up, maybe it's better to go for it directly.

Alternatively, if I move down, I can reach the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, which might allow me to create a new rule that helps me. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think about the simplest path first. Moving up to the ""win"" rule seems straightforward. But I should check if there are any blocks or doors in the way.

Looking back, the door is one step to the left and two steps down. So, it's not directly in the path to ""win."" Maybe I can ignore it for now and focus on reaching ""win.""

Wait, but if I move up, I might be able to reach ""win"" without any issues. Let me try that.

So, the action I should take is ""up"" to move towards the ""win"" rule.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I can move that rule, I can change what the door does. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule four steps down, which might be useful for changing my own properties.

If I move right, I might be able to get closer to the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, moving up could help me reach the ""is"" rule, which might allow me to create a new rule that helps me win more easily.

Wait, if I move up, I can reach the ""is"" rule, which is one step up. Then, maybe I can move it to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something else that changes the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Maybe I should just move towards the ""win"" rule directly. Let me try moving right first to get closer to the ""win"" rule. That way, I can see if there are any doors or other objects blocking my path.

After moving right, I'll be one step closer to the ""win"" rule. Then, I can move up to reach it. But I need to make sure there are no doors or other rules that might prevent me from moving up.

Alternatively, if moving right doesn't help, I can try moving up to access the ""is"" rule and see if I can create a new rule that makes winning easier. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by just being myself.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the ""win"" rule directly. Let me try that.

So, I'll move right first to get closer to the ""win"" rule. Then, I'll move up to reach it. If there's a door in the way, I might need to open it by manipulating the rules, but for now, I'll proceed towards the ""win"" rule.

To open the door, I might need to change the door's rule. If I can move the ""door"" rule, perhaps I can make it ""door is open"" or something like that.

Alternatively, I could try to change the ""baba"" rule to make myself into something else that can pass through the door without needing to open it. For example, if I make ""baba is wall,"" I could walk through walls, but that might not be necessary here.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to get to the ""door"" rule to change it. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So from my current position, I need to move left once and down three times. But I have to make sure I can move there without hitting any stops.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I move up, I can get to the ""is"" rule, but I'm not sure if that's helpful right now. Maybe I should focus on the door first.

So, to get to the ""door"" rule, I need to move left once and down three times. Let me plan that: left, down, down, down. Once I'm there, I can pick up the ""door"" rule and move it somewhere else to change the door's properties.

But before I do that, I should check if moving the ""door"" rule will help. If I move it next to the door object, maybe the door will change. For example, if I place the ""door"" rule next to the door, it might become ""door is open,"" allowing me to pass through.

Alternatively, I could move the ""is"" rule to the door to make it ""door is you,"" which would let me control the door, but that might not be necessary.

Another option is to move the ""win"" rule closer to me so I can reach it without dealing with the door. The ""win"" rule is one step up, so if I can move it to my current position, I can win immediately. But I don't know if that's allowed or if it's the intended solution.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up, so if I move up, I can reach it. But is there a door blocking me? The door is one step to the left and two steps down, so it's not directly in my path. Maybe I can just move up to win.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the door is a necessary part of the puzzle, and I need to open it to proceed further. So, perhaps I should focus on opening the door first.

To open the door, I need to change its rule. So, I'll move left once and down three times to get to the ""door"" rule. Then, I can move it next to the door object to change its property.

Once the door is open, I can move through it and reach the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, if I can make the door into something else, like a pushable object, I can move it out of the way.

Wait, another thought: if I can make ""baba is push,"" I can push the door. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here, so that might not be possible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win,"" then the door itself becomes the win condition, so I just need to reach it.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down step by step.

1. My current position: I'm at the starting point with ""baba is you.""
2. The ""win"" rule is one step up. If I move up, I can reach it and win.
3. The door is one step to the left and two steps down. It might be blocking the path to the ""win"" rule, but I'm not sure.
4. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. If I can change this rule, I can affect the door's behavior.

Wait, maybe the door isn't blocking the ""win"" rule. If the ""win"" rule is one step up, and the door is to the left and down, perhaps they are in different directions. So, maybe I can just move up to win without dealing with the door.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe the door is part of the path to the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, the ""win"" rule might be a distraction, and the actual win condition is elsewhere.

Another approach: let's look at all the rules and see how they can be manipulated.

- ""baba is you"": I control Baba.
- ""is"" rule is in multiple places, which can be used to create new rules.
- ""win"" rule is one step up.
- ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down.
- ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down.
- ""you"" rule is four steps down.
- ""ball"" is two steps to the right and four steps down.

If I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location, I can change where the win condition is. For example, if I move the ""win"" rule next to the door, then the door becomes the win condition.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by combining different parts. For example, moving the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" to make ""baba is something.""

Wait, if I move the ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down next to an ""is"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""baba is door"" or ""baba is win.""

That might be useful. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I go, I can win. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution.

Alternatively, if I make ""baba is push,"" I can push objects, but I don't see a ""push"" rule here.

Another idea: if I can make ""door is open,"" then the door will open, allowing me to pass through.

To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule next to the door object. The door is one step to the left and two steps down, and the ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So, if I move the ""door"" rule up once, it will be next to the door, making ""door is door,"" which doesn't change anything.

Wait, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the door. If I can get an ""is"" rule next to the door, I can create a new rule like ""door is open.""

But how? The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I move that ""is"" rule down three steps and right one step, it would be next to the door. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to another object. For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to make ""win is something.""

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. If I move the ""is"" rule up, I can create ""win is you,"" which would make the win condition into me, but that might not help.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""win"" rule first and see what happens. If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" rule and win the level. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution or if there's a trick.

Alternatively, maybe the door needs to be opened first, and the ""win"" rule is just a distraction. So, I should focus on opening the door.

To open the door, I need to change its rule. So, I'll move left once and down three times to get to the ""door"" rule. Then, I can move it next to the door to make ""door is open.""

Once the door is open, I can move through it and reach the ""win"" rule. That seems like a plausible path.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move left once to get to the column where the ""door"" rule is.
2. Move down three times to reach the ""door"" rule.
3. Pick up the ""door"" rule and move it next to the door object, which is one step up from there.
4. Now, the door should be open, allowing me to pass through.
5. Move up to reach the ""win"" rule and win the level.

Wait, but moving the ""door"" rule next to the door might not necessarily open it. I need to make sure that the new rule makes the door open.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door to create a new rule like ""door is open.""

But I'm not sure how to do that. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule from one step to the left and one step up down to the door's location.

That would require moving the ""is"" rule left once and down four steps, which seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule by moving the ""baba"" rule next to ""is."" For example, moving the ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down next to an ""is"" rule to make ""baba is something.""

If I make ""baba is push,"" I can push the door. But I don't see a ""push"" rule, so that might not work.

Wait, maybe I can make ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, if I make ""baba is door,"" I can become the door, but that seems odd.

I'm not making much progress. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""win"" rule first. If I move up, I can reach it and win. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution.

Alternatively, maybe the door is a necessary part of the puzzle, and I need to open it to proceed further. So, I should focus on opening the door.

To do that, I'll move left once and down three times to get to the ""door"" rule. Then, I'll move it next to the door to make ""door is open.""

Once the door is open, I can move through it and reach the ""win"" rule.

So, the actions would be:

1. Move left once.
2. Move down three times.
3. Move the ""door"" rule up once to be next to the door.
4. Move up to go through the door.
5. Move up again to reach the ""win"" rule.

Wait, but I'm not sure if moving the ""door"" rule up once will make the door open. I might need to create a specific rule like ""door is open.""

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door to create ""door is open.""

But that would require moving the ""is"" rule from one step to the left and one step up down to the door's location, which is one step to the left and two steps down. So, I need to move the ""is"" rule down three steps and right zero steps, which is possible.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move up once to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule.
3. Move down three times to reach the door's location.
4. Place the ""is"" rule next to the door to make ""door is open.""
5. Now, the door is open, so I can move through it.
6. Move up to reach the ""win"" rule and win.

That seems like a solid plan. So, the first action is to move up to get the ""is"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules around. I need to figure out how to get to the win.

The door is one step to the left and two steps down. There's a rule ""door"" one step to the left and three steps down, which might mean that the door has some property, maybe it's a barrier or something I can interact with. Then there's another rule ""baba"" two steps to the left and four steps down, which could be another Baba or a rule that affects Baba. There's also another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, and ""you"" four steps down. A ball is two steps to the right and four steps down, but I'm not sure how that plays into this.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I need to see if there are any obstacles or if I can manipulate the rules to make the win accessible. The win is just one step up, so maybe I can move up directly. But I should check if there's anything blocking me or if I need to change a rule first.

If I move up, will I reach the win? Or is there a rule preventing me from doing so? Maybe the door is in the way. If the door is one step to the left and two steps down, and the rule ""door"" is one step to the left and three steps down, perhaps the door has a property that stops movement. If that's the case, I might need to change the door's property to something else, like making it ""open"" or removing its stopping ability.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the door's property. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door, I could create a new rule like ""door is open,"" which would allow me to pass through. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule, which is currently one step to the left and one step up. If I can move it to the door's position, that might work.

Wait, but moving the ""is"" rule might disrupt other rules. I need to be careful. Let me think about the steps:

1. Move up to get closer to the win.
2. Check if the door is blocking the path.
3. If the door is blocking, find a way to change its property.
4. Use the ""is"" rule to modify the door's property.
5. Once the door is passable, move towards the win.

Alternatively, maybe the win is directly accessible without dealing with the door. Let me try moving up first and see what happens. If I can't move up because of the door, then I'll need to adjust the rules.

Another thought: the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe it's part of a different puzzle, but since my goal is the win, I can ignore it for now.

So, the immediate action is to move up towards the win. If that's blocked, then I'll need to manipulate the door's rule. But for now, let's try moving up.

The door is one step to the left and two steps down. There's a rule ""door"" one step to the left and three steps down. Hmm, maybe the door is blocking my path or something. Also, there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Not sure what that does yet.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules. Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can change the rules to make the door open or change the win condition. But right now, the win is straightforward—just reach it.

I'm currently at a position where the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I move up, I can reach the win. But is there something blocking me? Let me check the other rules. There's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down, and a ""you"" rule four steps down. Maybe those are just definitions and not obstacles.

Wait, the door is one step to the left and two steps down. If I move left, I might hit the door. But since I'm Baba, maybe I can pass through it. Or perhaps I need to change the door's property. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. If I move that, maybe I can make the door open or change its behavior.

But my main goal is to reach the win, which is one step up. So maybe I should just move up. Let me try that. If I move up, I can reach the win and complete the level. I don't see any immediate obstacles in that path, so moving up seems like the best action.

The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. That's probably where the Baba object is located. Since I'm Baba, I need to move towards the win or the door.

The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe that's another rule I can interact with to change the game's mechanics.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down. That might be where the player's starting position is, but since I'm Baba, I'm already in control.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule that's one step up. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door and a ball. Doors usually require something to open them, and balls can be pushed around.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So, the door is located there. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down, which is where Baba is. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, so that's where I am in relation to Baba.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Hmm, maybe I can push the ball somewhere. But how does that help me? Maybe if I can move the ball to change a rule or open the door.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. There's another ""is"" rule at one step to the left and four steps down. So, there are two ""is"" rules on the map. Maybe I can move one of them to create a new rule.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door, maybe I can make a new rule like ""door is win"" or something. That could change the win condition to the door, which might be easier to reach.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that aren't stopped. So, I need to see if the ""is"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, maybe it's not solid, so I can push it.

Let me plan my moves. I'm currently at the position of ""you,"" which is four steps down. So, I need to move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. If I move up once, I'll be at three steps down. Then, I can move left to reach the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up from my current position. So, moving up once and then left once should get me there. But I'm Baba, so I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it somewhere else.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can place it next to the door. That would create a new rule ""door is something."" Maybe ""door is win,"" which would make the door the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the door.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball to make the ball part of a new rule. But I'm not sure if that would help.

Another thought: the ""win"" rule is one step up. If I can get to that position, I win. But maybe the door is blocking the way. So, I need to open the door first.

To open the door, I might need a key, but I don't see a key mentioned. Alternatively, if I can change the door's properties, I can make it openable.

Wait, if I make the door ""is"" something else, like ""door is push,"" then I can push it open. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule to the door. So, I'll move up once to get closer, then left to pick up the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move down to the door's position and place the ""is"" rule next to it. That should create a new rule.

After placing the ""is"" rule next to the door, the new rule would be ""door is [something]."" If I can make it ""door is win,"" then the door becomes the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the door.

Alternatively, if I make ""door is push,"" I can push it open. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can push the ball to the door to open it. But I'm not sure how that would work.

I think the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule to the door to change its properties. So, I'll move up once, then left to get the ""is"" rule, then move down to the door and place it next to the door.

So, my first move should be up to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule one step up. So, if I can move up, I might reach the win condition. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe manipulating the rules.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I can change the door's properties, I can open it or make it do something else. There's also a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That might be another Baba or a rule that defines Baba's properties.

The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up, which is probably part of the existing ""baba is you"" rule. There's another ""is"" rule four steps down, which could be used to create new rules. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, which might be relevant for changing who I am or what I can do.

There's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition or manipulate other objects.

So, my initial thought is to move up to reach the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure that moving up is possible and doesn't lead to any obstacles. If moving up is blocked, I might need to manipulate the rules first.

Alternatively, maybe I should move left to access the ""is"" rule and create a new rule that could help me. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being Baba. But I need to check if that's possible with the current setup.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up, so if I move up, I might directly reach it. Let me try that. If I move up, I can check if that leads me to the win condition. If not, I'll have to think of another strategy, like moving left to access the ""is"" rule and create a new rule that changes the win condition or allows me to move through doors.

Another option is to move down to access the ""door"" rule and see if I can change the door's properties to open it or make it do something else. Maybe if I can make the door into a ""win"" object, I can win by going through it.

I also notice there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push the door or another object into a position that helps me reach the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

So, to summarize, my options are:
1. Move up to reach the ""win"" rule.
2. Move left to access the ""is"" rule and create a new rule.
3. Move down to interact with the door or other rules.
4. Use the ball to manipulate objects.

I think the simplest first step is to move up and see what happens. If that doesn't work, I'll try manipulating the rules by moving left or down.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules around. I need to figure out how to get to the win.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. There's also a ""rule door"" which might mean that the door has some property defined by that rule. Maybe the door is a barrier I need to open or something. But how?

I see a ""ball"" two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push or activate things. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win.

There are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. One is one step to the left and one step up, another is one step to the left and four steps down. These might be used to create new rules or modify existing ones. For example, if I can move a rule block next to another, I can change the rules of the game.

The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. That's probably the Baba character itself. The ""you"" rule is four steps down, which makes sense since I'm controlling Baba.

So, my plan is to move towards the win. Since the win is one step up, I should try moving up. But wait, is there anything blocking me? The door is one step to the left and two steps down, so it's not directly in my path. Maybe I can move up first.

If I move up, I might reach the win immediately. But I should check if there are any obstacles. If moving up is possible, that's the quickest way. If not, I might need to use the ball or rearrange some rules.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the rules to make the win condition something else or to make the door passable. For example, if I can make the door ""open"" or ""passable,"" I might be able to go through it.

But since the win is directly up, I think the simplest action is to move up. Let me try that.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and one step up. Then there's a ""rule `win`"" one step up. There's also a door one step to the left and two steps down, and some other rule blocks related to door, baba, is, and you. Additionally, there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, so the ""rule `win`"" is one step up. That probably means that the win condition is defined by that rule. If I can move the ""win"" rule block, maybe I can change what counts as winning. But right now, I'm Baba, so I need to figure out how to move around these rule blocks.

I also see a door. Doors in Baba Is You usually require a key or some condition to open. But I don't see a key mentioned here. Maybe the door is part of a rule that I can manipulate. The ""rule `door`"" is one step to the left and three steps down. So if I can move that, perhaps I can change the door's properties.

The ""rule `baba`"" is two steps to the left and four steps down. That might be defining Baba's properties. If I can move that, maybe I can change what Baba is or can do. Similarly, the ""rule `you`"" is four steps down, which is probably defining the player's perspective or control.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in the game often have specific behaviors, like pushing or being pushed. Maybe I can use the ball to help me move other objects.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""rule `win`"" block because changing the win condition might be a way to solve the level. But I need to see if I can reach it. It's one step up from my current position. Since I'm Baba, I can move up. Let me try moving up to get to the ""rule `win`"" block.

Wait, but if I move up, I might be able to pick up the ""rule `win`"" block and move it somewhere else. Maybe I can place it next to the door or the ball to change the win condition. Alternatively, I could try to break the existing rule by moving the ""is"" block away from ""baba"" to change what I am.

Another idea is to manipulate the door's rule. If I can move the ""rule `door`"" block, maybe I can make the door into something else or change its properties so it can be opened without a key.

I also notice there are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks. Maybe I can use them to create new rules. For example, if I can place ""is"" between two other objects, I can define a new rule.

Let me try moving up to the ""rule `win`"" block first. If I can move it, I might be able to set a new win condition. Alternatively, if I can't move it, maybe I need to approach it differently.

Wait, but I'm Baba, and the ""rule `is`"" block is one step to the left and one step up. Maybe I can move left and up to get to that block and then rearrange it.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the ball. If I can push the ball into a position where it can trigger a rule change, that might help. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with the rules yet.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change the win condition or make the door passable. Since the door is one step to the left and two steps down, maybe I can move it or change its rule to make it openable.

Let me try moving left and up to get to the ""rule `is`"" block. If I can move it, I can create a new rule. For example, if I place ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""open,"" I can make the door openable.

Wait, but I don't see an ""open"" rule here. Maybe I need to create it by rearranging existing blocks.

Alternatively, I could try to make Baba into something else by moving the ""rule `baba`"" block. If I can change ""baba is you"" into something else, maybe I can gain new abilities.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""rule `win`"" block first. If I can move it up, perhaps I can set the win condition to something else, like reaching the ball or opening the door.

Let me try moving up to the ""rule `win`"" block. If I can pick it up, I can move it to a new location. Maybe placing it next to the door would make the door the new win condition.

Alternatively, if I can't move it, I might need to break the existing rule by moving the ""is"" block away from ""baba."" That would stop me from being Baba, but maybe I can become something else.

Wait, but if I'm no longer Baba, I might lose control. That could be risky. Maybe I should try to create a new rule instead.

I think the best approach is to move towards the ""rule `win`"" block and see if I can change the win condition. That might make it easier to solve the level.

So, I'll try moving up to the ""rule `win`"" block. If I can move it, I'll place it next to the door to make the door the new win condition. Then, I can focus on opening the door.

Alternatively, if I can't move it, I'll look for another way to manipulate the rules. Maybe I can move the ""rule `door`"" block to change the door's properties.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think moving towards the ""rule `win`"" block is a good starting point. Let's try that.

There's also a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That might be another rule that defines Baba's properties. And another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can use that to change something about Baba or another object.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down. Since I'm Baba, which is ""you,"" maybe moving to that rule could change what ""you"" is, but I'm not sure how that would help yet.

There's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You usually can be pushed, but I don't see a direct way to use it here. Maybe it's a distraction or part of a different solution.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the win. Since the win is one step up, maybe I can just move up. But I need to check if there's anything blocking me or if moving up is possible.

Wait, the door is one step to the left and two steps down. If I move left and then down twice, I can reach the door. But why would I want to do that? Maybe the door is blocking the path to the win. Or perhaps moving the door's rule can change its properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule near the door to change its behavior. For example, if I can make the door ""open"" or ""passable,"" that might help me reach the win.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The win is one step up. If I move up, will I reach it? Or is there something else I need to do first?

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. So if I move up, I might be able to trigger the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I need to make sure that the win is reachable by moving up.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule somewhere else, I can create a new win condition that's easier to reach.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules around. I need to figure out how to get to the win.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. There's also a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down, and a ""you"" rule four steps down. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate these rules to change how Baba behaves or what the win condition is.

I see a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe that's a distraction or part of the puzzle. But right now, I think the key is to get to the ""win"" rule. Since it's one step up, maybe I can move up to reach it.

But wait, there's a ""door"" rule nearby. Doors usually require a key or some action to open. Is there a key somewhere? I don't see one mentioned, but maybe I can create one by rearranging the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule somewhere else, I might be able to reach it more easily. But how?

I also notice there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can stack them or move them to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba is win,"" then Baba would be the win condition, and I could just stand on myself to win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba is"" or something like that. Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one step to the left and one step up, and another one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to one of these ""is"" rules to create a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule that's one step to the left and one step up, I could form ""win is something."" But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it changes the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, I could create ""baba is win,"" which would make me the win condition. That might be a way to win without moving much.

But how do I move the rules? I can only move objects that aren't stopped by ""STOP"" or similar properties. So I need to check if the rules are movable. Since they're text blocks, I think they can be moved by pushing or pulling.

I'm currently at the starting position. The ""win"" rule is one step up, so maybe I can move up to it. But if I do that, will I win immediately? Or is there something else I need to do first?

Wait, if I move up to the ""win"" rule, I might just win the level right away. But maybe the level requires more steps or manipulating other rules. I'm not sure, but it's worth a try.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go around and manipulate other rules first. For example, if I can make the door open or change the win condition, that might be necessary.

But since the ""win"" rule is right there, one step up, maybe I can just move up and win. Let me try that.

So, my plan is to move up to the ""win"" rule and see if that works. If it does, great! If not, I'll have to think of another strategy, like rearranging the rules to change the win condition or open the door.

I think moving up is the simplest action, so I'll try that first.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. If I move that, maybe I can change what Baba is. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

Let me think about the immediate goal. The win is one step up. If I move up, will I reach it? Or is there something blocking me? The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. Maybe that's part of the current rule setup.

I should also consider the ""you"" rule four steps down. Since I'm Baba, which is ""you,"" maybe moving down could change something, but I'm not sure.

Perhaps the best approach is to move towards the win. Since it's one step up, I'll try moving up. If that doesn't work, I might need to adjust the rules by moving some of the rule blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new rule to make the door passable or to change the win condition. But for now, I'll try moving up to see if I can reach the win directly.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down, and a ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's a distraction or part of the solution.

I think the key is to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows me to move through the door or change the door's properties. If I can make the door moveable or turn it into something else, I can reach the win.

So, I need to move towards the ""is"" rule that's one step to the left and four steps down. To get there, I might need to move left and down. But I have to be careful not to get stuck or move into something immovable.

Wait, the door is one step to the left and two steps down. If I move left and down, I might hit the door. Maybe I can change the door's rule first. If I can make the door ""move"" or ""push,"" I can pass through it.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer. But that might not be necessary if I can just reach it directly.

Let me plan my steps. I'm currently at a position where ""win"" is one step up. If I move up, I might reach it, but maybe there's something blocking me. Alternatively, moving left and down to manipulate the rules could be the way to go.

I think the best course is to move up towards the ""win"" rule. If that's blocked, I'll adjust. But since ""win"" is directly up, that's the most straightforward path. Let me try moving up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `win` 1 step up"" which probably means that the win condition is one step up from where that rule is placed. Similarly, there's a ""door"" object two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down, which might define the door's properties.

I also notice a ""rule `baba`"" two steps to the left and four steps down, and a ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and four steps down. There's a ""rule `you`"" four steps down, and a ""ball"" two steps to the right and four steps down.

Since I'm Baba, I need to figure out how to move to reach the win condition. The win rule is one step up, so maybe I need to move up from my current position. But I should also consider if there are any obstacles or other rules that might affect my movement.

I see a door two steps down. Doors in Baba Is You usually require a key or some action to open. There's also a ball, which might be used to push or interact with other objects. The rules involving ""is"" and ""you"" suggest that I can manipulate the properties of objects by moving the rule blocks.

Perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule closer to me or change it to something else. Alternatively, I might need to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks to redefine what Baba can do.

Let me try to visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, moving up might take me towards the ""win"" rule. But I also need to consider if there are any blocks or doors in the way. The door is two steps down, so maybe I need to go around it or find a way to open it.

Wait, the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. That might mean that the door has some property defined by that rule. If I can move that rule, I might be able to change the door's behavior. For example, if I make the door ""is"" something else, it might become passable or openable.

Alternatively, the ball two steps to the right and four steps down could be used to push into the door or to reach the win condition. Maybe I can move the ball into a position where it can help me reach the win.

I'm also noticing that there are multiple ""is"" rules. Maybe I can stack them or rearrange them to create a new rule that benefits me. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win immediately. But I need to see if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me think about the steps I need to take. First, I should probably move towards the win condition. Since it's one step up, I can try moving up. But I need to make sure there's nothing blocking that path. If there's a door or another object, I might need to move it first.

If moving up is blocked, I might need to go around. The door is two steps down, so maybe I can go down, deal with the door, and then move up. But I need to figure out how to open the door. If the door's rule is three steps down, I might need to move that rule to change its properties.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""win"" rule closer to me. If I can bring the ""win"" rule next to me, then stepping on it would make me win. But I need to see if that's possible without getting stuck.

Another idea is to use the ball. If I can push the ball into a position where it triggers the win condition or opens the door, that might help. But I need to be careful with how the ball moves and interacts with other objects.

I'm also considering if there are any other rules I can manipulate. The ""rule `you`"" is four steps down, which might mean that I can change what ""you"" is. If I can redefine ""you"" to be something else, it might give me new abilities or change the win condition.

Wait, if I can make ""you is win,"" then stepping on the win condition would make me win. But I need to see if that's possible with the current rules. I might need to move the ""you"" rule and the ""win"" rule together to create that new rule.

Overall, I think the best approach is to move towards the win condition. If that's blocked, I'll need to find a way to open the door or rearrange the rules to make the win condition accessible. I'll start by moving up to see if that leads me closer to the win.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `win` 1 step up"" which probably means that the win condition is one step up from where that rule is placed. I also see a door and a ball, which might be part of the puzzle.

I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or pull objects. The key is to rearrange the rule blocks to create new rules or modify existing ones.

First, I should identify where the ""WIN"" object is. The rule `win` is one step up, so I need to find that position. Also, there's a door two steps down, and a rule `door` three steps down. Maybe the door is blocking the way to the win condition, and I need to open it by changing its properties.

I also notice there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push multiple objects at once, which might help in rearranging the rules.

Let me think about the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then Baba would become the win condition, which might help me win the level. Alternatively, I could change the win condition to something else.

Looking at the rule blocks, I see ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step up."" Maybe I can move this to create a new rule. If I can get ""baba is win,"" that would make me the win condition, so stepping on myself would win the game.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule block next to the ""win"" rule block. But I have to check if I can move them. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, and if I can push the rule blocks, I can rearrange them.

I should also consider the door. If the door is blocking the path, I might need to change its properties. For example, if I can make the door ""open"" or ""passable,"" I can get through it. The rule `door` is three steps down, so maybe I can modify that rule.

Another idea is to use the ball to push multiple rule blocks at once. If I can position the ball correctly, I can push several blocks into new positions, creating new rules or modifying existing ones in one move.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Move Baba to a position where I can push the ""is"" rule block.
2. Push the ""is"" rule block next to the ""win"" rule block to create ""baba is win.""
3. Once that rule is active, stepping on Baba would win the game.

Alternatively, if I can't move the ""is"" block directly, I might need to use the ball to push it. I should check if the ball is in a position where I can push it towards the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. That might be too far to reach in one move. Maybe I need to move Baba closer to the ball first.

Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, I can move up, right, down, or left. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up from its current position. So, if I move left and up, I can reach it.

But I need to make sure that moving in those directions doesn't lead me into a wall or an immovable object. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move freely unless there are other rules preventing me.

I think the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" rule block and try to push it next to the ""win"" rule block. If that's not possible, I'll look for alternative ways to create a new rule.

Another consideration is the ""you"" rule block four steps down. If I can manipulate that, it might change how I interact with other objects.

Overall, the key is to rearrange the rule blocks to create a new rule that either changes the win condition or makes Baba the win condition. Once that's done, I can step on myself to win the level.

I think the first step is to move towards the ""is"" rule block. Let me try moving left and up to get closer to it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" block, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""WIN"" rule one step to the right and one step up. So, the win condition is probably that block. There's also a door two steps down, and a rule ""door"" three steps down. Hmm, doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe changing the rules.

There's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. That might be another Baba or a rule that defines Baba's properties. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, and ""you"" is one step to the right and four steps down. Also, there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change rules.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""WIN"" block. Since it's one step right and one step up, I should probably move right first. But wait, I need to make sure there's a clear path. Let me visualize the map.

Starting from my current position, moving right would take me towards the ""WIN"" block. But I also notice the door two steps down. Maybe I need to open the door to get to the win condition. To open the door, I might need to change the rules or find a key.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the door passable without needing a key. For example, if I can make ""door is open"" or something like that. But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule block.

Looking at the ""door"" rule, it's three steps down. So, if I move down three times, I can reach it. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach right now. Maybe I should first try to get closer to the win condition.

Another option is to use the ball. If I can push the ball into a position where it affects the rules, that might help. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down, which is quite far. Maybe I can move towards it after handling the door.

Wait, let me think again. The ""WIN"" block is just one step right and one step up. If I move right, then up, I might reach it. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The door is two steps down, so it's not directly in my path. Maybe I can ignore it for now.

Alternatively, if the door is blocking the path to the win condition, I might need to open it first. To open the door, I could try to change the rule. If I can move the ""door"" rule block to make ""door is open,"" that would help. But I need to be able to move the rule block, which requires that it's not fixed.

Looking at the ""door"" rule, it's three steps down. So, I can move down three times to reach it. Once there, I can try to move it somewhere else to change the rule. Maybe I can place it next to ""is"" to make a new rule like ""door is open.""

But before I do that, I should make sure that moving the ""door"" rule won't cause any issues. Also, I need to consider the other rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, and ""you"" is one step right and four steps down. Maybe I can use those to create new rules.

Wait, if I move the ""door"" rule to the ""is"" block, I can create ""door is something."" But I need to see what's available. The ""you"" rule is one step right and four steps down. Maybe I can make ""door is you,"" but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is open,"" that would allow me to pass through. So, I need to find a way to create that rule. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule block next to an ""is"" block and a ""open"" block. But I don't see an ""open"" block mentioned. Hmm.

Maybe I can use the ball to push the ""door"" rule block into position. The ball is three steps right and four steps down. If I can get the ball to push the ""door"" rule, that might work. But that seems a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can just move the ""door"" rule block myself. If I move down three times, I can reach it. Then, I can move it to the left or right to create a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""is"" and ""open"" if possible.

But I'm not sure where the ""open"" block is. Maybe I need to create it by rearranging other rules. For example, if I have ""baba is open,"" that might make Baba able to open doors. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is one step left and four steps down. So, if I move there, I can change the Baba's properties. Maybe I can make ""baba is open,"" which would allow me to open doors.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on getting to the win condition first. Let me try moving right and up to see if I can reach it without issues.

If I move right, then up, I should be at the ""WIN"" block. But I need to make sure there's no obstacle. Since the door is two steps down, it's not in my way. So, maybe I can just move right and up to win.

Wait, but the ""WIN"" block is one step right and one step up from my current position. So, moving right and then up should do it. Let me try that.

But before I do that, I should check if there are any other rules that might affect this. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm controlling Baba. There's also a ""you"" rule four steps down, which might define something about me.

If I move right and up, I might trigger some rule change. I'm not sure, but it's worth a try. If it doesn't work, I can always try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the win condition. If I can make something else the win condition, that might help. But I'm not sure how to do that right now.

I think the best course of action is to move right and then up to reach the ""WIN"" block. Let's try that.

I think I need to manipulate these rules to change the game's mechanics. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects or combine rules. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to another word to create a new rule. For example, if I can get ""baba"" next to ""win,"" that might change the win condition.

But first, I need to get to the win. It's just one step up, but maybe there's something preventing me from moving there. Let me try moving up. If that's blocked, I might need to change the rules to make it passable.

Wait, there's a door one step to the left and two steps down. Doors usually require a key or a specific action to open. Is there a key nearby? I don't see one mentioned, but maybe I can create one by rearranging rules. If I can make ""door"" into something else, maybe it'll open.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I just need to be Baba to win. But how do I do that? I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba.""

I'll try moving up. If that works, great! If not, I'll have to look for alternative strategies, like rearranging rules to change the door or the win condition.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules scattered around. I need to figure out how to manipulate these rules to get to the win.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. There's also a ""door"" object one step to the left and two steps down. Maybe I can move the door's rule to change its properties. If I can make the door open or change its behavior, that might help me reach the win.

I see a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can move this to change what Baba is. If I can make Baba into something else, like a block or a key, that could help me interact with the door or other objects.

There's also an ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can use this to create a new rule by moving it next to another object. For example, if I can get ""is"" next to ""win,"" I might be able to change the win condition.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down. I'm not sure what that does yet, but maybe it's related to controlling something else. The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to push objects or break things.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to create a path to the win. Since the win is one step up, I need to figure out how to get there. Maybe I can move the door's rule to make the door openable, then go through it. Or perhaps I can change the win condition to something else that's easier to reach.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule next to the door. If I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through it. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the same position as the door. The door is one step to the left and three steps down, and the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. So I need to move the ""is"" rule up by one step to align it with the door.

Once the ""is"" rule is next to the door, I can form a new rule ""door is open."" That should make the door passable. Then, I can move through the door and reach the win.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is. If I make ""baba is key,"" then I can open the door without changing the door's properties. That might be another way to solve it.

I think the first approach is better because it directly affects the door, making it easier to pass. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule up to align with the door, creating ""door is open."" Then, I can move up through the door and reach the win.

Wait, but how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that aren't stopped. I need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. Since it's a rule, I think it can be moved by pushing it with Baba.

So, I'll move Baba down to the ""is"" rule, then push it up to align with the door. Once that's done, the new rule ""door is open"" will be active, allowing me to pass through the door.

After that, I can move up to the win and complete the level. That seems like a solid plan.

The ""win"" rule is one step up. So if I move up, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there's nothing blocking me. Let me check the other objects. There's a door one step to the left and two steps down. Hmm, maybe that's a distraction or part of another rule.

There are several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and another ""is."" These might be used to change the rules if I move them. For example, if I can move a ""door"" rule next to something else, it might change the door's properties.

But right now, my main goal is to reach the ""win"" rule. Since it's one step up, I think moving up is the way to go. I don't see any immediate obstacles, so maybe I can just move up and win.

Wait, but sometimes in Baba Is You, the win condition can change. I should check if there are any other rules that might affect what counts as winning. For example, if there's a rule like ""door is win,"" then I might need to go through the door instead.

Looking at the objects again, there's a ""rule door"" one step to the left and three steps down. If I move that next to the door, it might change the door's properties. But I'm not sure if that's necessary right now.

I think the simplest approach is to move up to the ""win"" rule. Let me try that.

There are several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and another ""is."" These can be moved to create or change rules. For example, if I move a ""door"" rule next to something else, it might change the door's properties.

I also see a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change the environment. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move Baba around. So, I can move up, down, left, or right. Let me try moving up first since the win is one step up. If I move up, I might reach the win and complete the level.

But I should also consider if moving other rule blocks could help. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the door, maybe I can make the door into something else, like a pushable object. Or perhaps I can make the door into a win condition.

Alternatively, moving the ""you"" rule could change what I control. If I make something else ""you,"" I might gain new abilities. But that might complicate things, and I just need to reach the win.

Given that the win is directly up, maybe the simplest solution is to move up. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. The goal is usually to reach the win condition, but I need to check what's on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up. That probably means if I can get to that position, I'll win. But wait, there's also a door one step to the left and two steps down. Doors usually require a key or something to open, but I don't see a key mentioned here. Maybe the door is part of a rule that I can manipulate.

There are several rule blocks: ""is,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" and another ""is."" These can be moved to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""door"" rule next to ""win,"" maybe I can make ""door is win,"" which would change the win condition to the door. That could be useful if the door is blocking the way to the original win.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to move a rule block.

I need to figure out how to move these rule blocks. Since I'm Baba, I can move around. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I move there, I can pick it up and move it elsewhere. Maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, but that might not help directly.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to something else, I can change what ""you"" is. For example, if I make ""you is door,"" then I can become the door, which might let me pass through it.

Alternatively, moving the ""door"" rule next to ""win"" to make ""door is win"" would change the win condition to the door. Then, I just need to reach the door to win. But I need to check if the door is movable or if it's blocking the path.

I think the best approach is to move the ""door"" rule up to the ""win"" rule. That way, ""door is win"" becomes the new rule, and I can target the door as the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""door"" rule from its current position (one step to the left and three steps down) to next to the ""win"" rule, which is one step up.

So, I'll plan my moves: first, move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule, then move left to pick up the ""door"" rule, and then move it up next to ""win."" Once that's done, the win condition changes, and I can proceed to the door to win.

But wait, I need to make sure I can move the ""door"" rule. Since it's a rule block, I should be able to move it as long as it's not fixed. Let me visualize the map:

- Baba is at the starting position.
- ""is"" is one step up and left.
- ""win"" is one step up.
- Door is one step left and two down.
- ""door"" rule is one step left and three down.
- ""baba"" rule is two left and four down.
- Another ""is"" is one left and four down.
- ""you"" is four down.
- Ball is two right and four down.

So, to get to the ""door"" rule, I need to move left and down. Then, I can pick it up and move it up to the ""win"" rule. Once ""door is win"" is active, I can go to the door to win.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push the ""door"" rule into place, but I'm not sure if the ball can push rule blocks. It might be safer to move the rule myself.

Another thought: if I make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by staying where I am, but that doesn't seem helpful. I think changing the win condition to the door is better because it's a specific target.

So, the steps are:

1. Move left to reach the column where the ""door"" rule is.
2. Move down to pick up the ""door"" rule.
3. Move up to place it next to the ""win"" rule, creating ""door is win.""
4. Then, move to the door to win.

I need to make sure I can move the ""door"" rule without getting stuck. Let me try moving left first.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check where it is.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a ""rule `win`"" that's one step to the right and one step up. So, the win condition is somewhere in that direction. There's also a door, which is one step to the left and two steps down. The door has its own rule, ""rule `door`,"" which is one step to the left and three steps down. That might mean the door is interactive or has some property I can change.

I notice there's a ""rule `baba`"" two steps to the left and four steps down. That could be a rule that defines Baba's properties. There's another ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and four steps down, which might be part of another rule set. The ""rule `you`"" is four steps down, which probably relates to the player's identity since ""baba is you"" is active.

There's also a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of the puzzle.

So, my first thought is to move towards the win condition. Since ""rule `win`"" is one step up and one step to the right, I should move in that direction. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles. The door is one step to the left and two steps down, so it's not directly in my path. Maybe I can move up first.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is one step to the left and one step up. That might be a rule block that I can move to change the rules. If I move up, I might be able to grab that ""is"" block and rearrange it to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to another object, I could change what ""baba"" is or what ""you"" is.

Alternatively, moving right might bring me closer to the win condition. But I should check if moving right is possible without hitting any walls or immovable objects. The ""rule `win`"" is one step up and one step to the right, so moving right first might not be necessary if I can reach it by moving up.

I think the best course of action is to move up first. That way, I can potentially interact with the ""is"" rule block and maybe change the rules to make the win condition easier to reach or to unlock the door. If I can manipulate the rules, I might be able to turn the door into something else or make the ball do something useful.

So, I'll choose to move up. That should help me get closer to the ""is"" rule block and possibly change the rules to my advantage.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is the ""win"" object. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and one step up. That seems like where I need to go. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. I remember that doors usually require a key or some action to open them. 

Hmm, there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe that's defining the door's properties. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, which might be another instance of Baba or a rule related to Baba. 

I see a ""you"" rule four steps down, which could be defining what ""you"" is. And a ""ball"" three steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. 

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" object. Since it's one step to the right and one step up, I should probably move right first. But I need to check if there are any obstacles or if moving right is possible. 

Wait, the ""win"" is one step up from my current position. If I move up, I might reach it. But I also need to consider the other rules. The ""is"" rule is one step up, which might be part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I move up, I could potentially break that rule, which might not be good. 

Alternatively, moving right first might be safer. Let me try that. If I move right, I can then move up towards the ""win."" But I should also check if moving right leads me closer to any other important objects or rules. 

I also notice the door two steps down. Maybe I need to go down to interact with it, but that might take me away from the ""win."" I'm not sure if the door is necessary for this level. 

Another thing to consider is the ""ball"" three steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe the ball is a distraction or part of a different rule. I should focus on the immediate goal first. 

So, to summarize, I think the best course of action is to move right first to get closer to the ""win"" object. That way, I can then move up to reach it without disrupting the current rules too much. 

Wait, but if I move right, will that affect any rules? The ""is"" rule is one step up, so moving right shouldn't interfere with that. I think it's safe. 

Alright, I'll choose to move right.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. Let me try moving up first to see if that gets me closer to the win. If that doesn't work, I'll consider moving left to manipulate the rules.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. The objects on the map are a bit scattered, but I need to figure out how to move them to change the rules or reach the win condition.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up. That's probably the win condition, so I need to reach that. There's also a door one step to the left and two steps down. The door has its own rule: ""door is door"" three steps down. Hmm, that might mean the door is a solid block or something.

I see a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That's probably another Baba object. There's another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, and a ""you"" rule four steps down. Also, there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something? But I'm not sure how that would help yet.

Let me think about the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules, maybe I can change the win condition or make something else winnable.

Looking at the ""win"" rule, it's one step up. If I can move that, maybe I can set it somewhere else. But how? I need to move the ""is"" block to combine it with ""win"" to make a new rule.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule one step to the left and one step up. If I can move that ""is"" to the ""win"" rule, I can create ""win is something."" But what would that do? Maybe make the win condition something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule. The door is one step to the left and two steps down, and its rule is three steps down. If I can change the door's property, maybe I can make it passable.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to visualize the map. Baba is probably at the starting point. The ""win"" rule is up, so maybe I can move up to win, but there might be a door blocking the way.

Wait, the door is one step to the left and two steps down from where I am. So if I move left and down twice, I can reach the door. But the door's rule is three steps down, which might mean it's a solid block. So I can't pass through it unless I change its rule.

If I can make the door ""is"" something else, like ""door is push,"" maybe I can push it. But I don't see a ""push"" rule here. Alternatively, if I can make the door ""is"" nothing, it might disappear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the door to change its property. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to the door, I can create ""door is you,"" which would make the door controllable. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I can move that ""is"" to the door's position, I can create a new rule. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I can only move objects that are not ""stop."" So if the ""is"" rule is movable, I can pick it up and place it elsewhere.

Let me try to plan my moves. I need to get to the ""win"" rule, which is one step up. But there's a door blocking the way. So I need to either move the door or change its rule.

If I move left and down twice to reach the door, but the door is blocking the path. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the door to change its property. For example, if I can make ""door is push,"" I can push it aside.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, if I can make ""door is nothing,"" it might disappear. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Wait, there's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can use that to create another Baba, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to change what ""you"" is. The ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move it, I can make ""you is something else,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. But I'm not sure how.

Let me think again. The main goal is to reach the ""win"" rule, which is one step up. But the door is blocking the way. So I need to either move the door or change its rule.

If I can move the ""is"" rule to the door, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to the door, I can make ""door is you,"" which would make the door controllable. Then I can move the door out of the way.

So, how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it from its current position (one step to the left and one step up) to the door's position (one step to the left and two steps down). That would require moving down three steps from the ""is"" rule's position.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up from my current position. So if I move left and up, I can pick it up. Then I can move it down to the door.

But I'm not sure if I can carry the ""is"" rule. In Baba Is You, you can pick up and move blocks, including rule blocks. So yes, I can move the ""is"" rule.

So, my plan is:

1. Move left and up to pick up the ""is"" rule.
2. Move down to the door's position.
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to the door to create a new rule, like ""door is you.""
4. Now, the door becomes controllable, so I can move it aside.
5. Then, I can move up to reach the ""win"" rule and win the level.

Wait, but when I place the ""is"" rule next to the door, it would form ""door is [something]."" What would that something be? If I place it to the right of the door, it would be ""door is [next block]."" But I need to make sure that the new rule makes the door passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" rule. So perhaps making ""door is you"" would make it so that I can move the door as if it's me.

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is nothing,"" the door would disappear. But I'm not sure how to do that without a ""nothing"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can just move the door by making it ""is"" something that allows movement. For example, if I can make ""door is move,"" but I don't see a ""move"" rule either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to just move the ""is"" rule to the door and see what happens. If I place the ""is"" rule to the right of the door, it would create ""door is [next block]."" But what's next to the door? Maybe another rule or an object.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the left of the door, making ""[something] is door."" But that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I should try to move the ""is"" rule to the door's position and then see if I can form a new rule that makes the door passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is one step up. If I can move it down, I can reach it without going through the door.

But how? I can only move blocks that are not ""stop."" So if the ""win"" rule is movable, I can pick it up and place it elsewhere.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. So if I move up, I can pick it up. Then I can move it down to a position where I can reach it without going through the door.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's easier to just move the door.

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Move left and up to pick up the ""is"" rule.
2. Move down to the door's position (one step to the left and two steps down from start).
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to the door to create a new rule, such as ""door is you.""
4. Now, the door becomes controllable, so I can move it aside.
5. Move up to reach the ""win"" rule and win.

But I'm not sure if placing the ""is"" rule next to the door will create the desired effect. Maybe I need to form ""door is push"" or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move it, I can make ""you is something else,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I move it up, I can combine it with another rule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. If I can push it, maybe it can help me reach something.

But I'm not sure how to use the ball in this scenario. It might be a red herring.

Let me try to focus on the door. If I can make the door passable, I can reach the ""win"" rule. So, moving the ""is"" rule to the door seems like the way to go.

So, I'll move left and up to pick up the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move down to the door's position and place the ""is"" rule next to the door. This should create a new rule, perhaps ""door is you,"" making the door controllable.

Once the door is controllable, I can move it aside, either left or right, to clear the path. Then, I can move up to reach the ""win"" rule and win the level.

I think that's the best course of action. So, I'll start by moving left and up to pick up the ""is"" rule.

I need to figure out how to move to reach the ""win"" object. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. The ""win"" is one step up, so maybe I can just move up. But wait, is there anything blocking me? Let me check the map again.

The door is two steps down. If I move down twice, I might hit the door. But without knowing the door's rule, I'm not sure if I can pass through it. The ""door"" rule is three steps down, so maybe if I move there, I can change the door's property. If I can make the door open, I might be able to pass through it.

Alternatively, maybe I don't need to go through the door. The ""win"" is just one step up, so perhaps I can reach it directly. But I should also consider the other rules. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, which might be part of another rule that could help me. The ""you"" rule is four steps down to the right, which could change how I'm controlled if I move there.

Wait, if I move up, I can reach the ""win"" directly. That seems straightforward. But I should make sure there are no obstacles. Since the door is two steps down, moving up shouldn't interfere with it. So, moving up once should take me to the ""win"" and complete the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe changing a rule.

I see a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe I can manipulate that. There's also a ""baba"" rule four steps down and to the left, and a ""you"" rule four steps down and to the right. Hmm, maybe I can move these rules around to change how Baba behaves or what the win condition is.

The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change rules by moving them into place. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win or manipulate the door.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. If I move up, I might reach the ""win"" rule directly. But I need to check if there's anything blocking me or if moving up is the right move.

Wait, if I move up, I might be able to reach the ""win"" rule and win the level. But I should also consider if there are other rules or objects that could help me. For example, if I move left or right, I might be able to access other rules that could change the game's mechanics.

Alternatively, moving down could let me interact with the door or the other rules. If I move down twice, I can reach the door. Maybe the door is blocking the path to the win, and I need to open it by changing a rule.

But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba freely unless there's a ""stop"" rule somewhere. I don't see a ""stop"" rule mentioned, so I can move around as long as I'm not blocked by objects.

Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting position. Up is the ""win"" rule. To the left and down, there are other rules and the door. To the right and down, there's the ball.

If I move up, I might win immediately. But I should check if that's possible. Alternatively, moving right could let me use the ball to push something or change a rule.

Wait, the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I should focus on the closer objects first.

If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" rule. But is that the actual win condition? Or is the win condition something else? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I need to make sure that when I reach the ""win"" rule, it triggers the win.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule somewhere else or combining it with another rule.

But for now, moving up seems like the simplest action. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe changing a rule.

I see a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I can make Baba into a door opener or something. There's also a ""baba"" rule four steps down to the left, which might be a duplicate or another instance of Baba. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, which could be useful for creating new rules.

The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things. Maybe I can use the ball to move something into place.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" rule. Since it's one step up, I can try moving up. But I need to make sure there's nothing blocking me. If moving up is blocked, maybe I need to adjust the rules first.

Alternatively, maybe I should move right to get closer to the ball or other rules. If I move right, I can then move up towards the win. Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting point, moving right would take me towards the ball, which might be useful later.

Wait, the ""win"" is one step up, so moving up directly might be the quickest way. But I should check if there's any obstacle. If moving up is possible, that's the way to go. If not, I might need to create a new rule or move some objects.

I think the best first move is to try moving up towards the win. If that's blocked, I'll have to adjust my strategy, maybe by moving right to access other rules or objects.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule that's one step to the right and one step up. So, if I can get to that position, I might win. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, maybe a key or another rule.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. That might mean that the door has some property defined by that rule. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, which could be another instance of Baba or a rule that affects Baba. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, which might be another rule that can be manipulated.

The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and four steps down, which could affect how I'm controlled. And there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or break things.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" rule. Since it's one step right and one step up, I should try moving in that direction. But I need to check if there are any obstacles or if I can manipulate the rules to make it easier.

If I move right and up, I might encounter the door. If the door is blocking my path, I need to figure out how to open it. Maybe I can use the ball to push the door or change the rules so that the door becomes passable.

Alternatively, I could try to rearrange the rules to change what ""win"" means. For example, if I can make ""win"" be something else, I might win without having to reach that specific position. But that might be more complicated.

Another option is to see if I can make Baba into something else, like a key, to open the door. If I can change the rules so that Baba is a key, then I can open the door and proceed.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is three steps down. Maybe if I move there and change the rule, I can make the door openable. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through.

But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup. Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. So, I need to choose one of these actions.

If I move up, I might get closer to the ""win"" rule. If I move right, I might reach the ball or the ""you"" rule. If I move down, I might reach the door or the ""door"" rule. Moving left might take me away from the goal.

Given that the ""win"" rule is up and to the right, moving up seems like a good start. But I also need to consider if moving right first would be better to get the ball or change a rule.

Hmm, maybe moving right first to get the ball, then using it to push something. But I'm not sure if the ball is movable or if it's just an object.

Alternatively, moving up to get closer to the ""win"" rule might be more straightforward. Let me try that.

Wait, but if I move up, I might not be able to reach the ""win"" rule directly because of the door. Maybe I need to go around. Let me visualize the map.

The ""win"" rule is one step right and one step up from my current position. So, if I move right and then up, I should reach it. But is there a door in the way? The door is two steps down, so maybe it's not directly in my path.

Wait, no, the door is two steps down, which is below me. So, moving up and right should take me towards the ""win"" rule without hitting the door. That seems possible.

But I also need to consider the other rules. The ""baba"" rule is one step left and four steps down, which is far from me. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, and the ""you"" rule is one step right and four steps down. The ball is three steps right and four steps down.

So, focusing on the immediate goal, moving up and right seems the way to go. Let me try moving up first to get closer to the ""win"" rule.

Wait, but the ""win"" rule is one step right and one step up. So, maybe I should move right first, then up. Or up first, then right. Either way, I need to get to that position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right to get to the ""you"" rule, which might change how I'm controlled. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

I think the safest bet is to move towards the ""win"" rule. Let me try moving right first, then up. But since I can only choose one action, I need to decide which direction to go first.

If I move right, I might get closer to the ""you"" rule and the ball, which could be useful. If I move up, I get closer to the ""win"" rule directly.

I think moving up first would be better because it directly moves me towards the win condition. So, I'll choose to move up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step up, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. That probably means the win condition is somewhere in that direction. There's also a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. So the door has some rule associated with it, maybe about how it behaves.

Then there's a ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down. That could be modifying Baba's properties. Another ""rule `is`"" four steps down, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and four steps down, which could affect how I'm controlled. Lastly, there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down.

I need to figure out how to move these rule blocks to change the rules to my advantage. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push objects. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the door openable or change the win condition.

First, I should probably move towards the ""rule `win`"" to see what it does. If I can get there, maybe I can change the win condition to something easier. Alternatively, moving towards the door might help if I can figure out how to open it.

Wait, the door is two steps down, and the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. Maybe if I move the door's rule, I can make it openable. For example, if I can make the door ""is open"" or something like that.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the current setup. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The ""rule `win`"" is up and to the right. Maybe I should move towards that to see if I can change the win condition.

But wait, the ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up from my current position. So if I move right, I'll be next to it. Then I can move up to reach it. Alternatively, moving up first might be better.

Hmm, maybe I should move up first to get closer to the ""rule `is`"" and see if I can form a new rule. If I can create a rule like ""door is open,"" that would help me progress.

Alternatively, moving towards the door might be necessary. The door is two steps down, so if I move down twice, I can reach it. But I need to see if it's openable.

Wait, the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. So if I move down three times, I can reach that rule. Maybe I can move the door's rule to make it openable.

After moving up, I'll be one step closer to the ""rule `is`."" Then, I can move right to get to the ""rule `win`"" and see if I can change the win condition.

Alternatively, moving right first might be better to reach the ""rule `win`"" faster.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step up, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. That probably means the win condition is somewhere in that direction. There's also a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. I'm not sure what that means yet.

Then there's a ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down. That might be defining something about Baba. There's another ""rule `is`"" four steps down, which could be another part of a rule. The ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and four steps down, which might affect how I'm controlled. Lastly, there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down.

I think I need to move around to see how these rules interact. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and try to manipulate the rules. Maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block to change the win condition. Or perhaps I need to move the door to open it. I should also check if moving any rule blocks can change my properties or the environment.

Let me try moving up first to see what's there. If I move up, I might reach the ""rule `is`"" block. Maybe I can pick that up and move it somewhere else to create a new rule. Alternatively, moving right could get me closer to the ""rule `win`"" block, which might help me change the win condition to something else.

Wait, if I move right and up, I can reach the ""rule `win`"" block. If I move that block next to something else, like the door, maybe I can make the door the new win condition. That could be useful if the door is blocking something important.

Alternatively, moving down might let me interact with the door or the other rule blocks. The door is two steps down, so I can try moving down twice to reach it. But I need to check if the door is open or closed. If it's closed, maybe I can find a way to open it by changing the rules.

I also notice there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something, like moving it into a rule block to change the rules. But I'm not sure how yet.

Let me think about the rules again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba around. If I can create a new rule like ""door is win,"" then the door would become the win condition. That might be a way to win the level by reaching the door instead of the usual ""WIN"" block.

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" block next to the door. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up from my current position. So I can move right and up to pick it up. Then, I can move down to where the door is and place the ""rule `win`"" block next to it, forming ""door is win.""

Once that's done, the win condition changes to the door. Then I just need to reach the door to win the level. But I need to make sure that the door isn't blocked or that I can open it somehow. Maybe moving the door or changing its properties will help.

Alternatively, if I can't change the win condition, I might need to find another way to reach the ""WIN"" block. But it's easier to try changing the rules first since that's a common strategy in Baba Is You.

So, my plan is to move right and up to get the ""rule `win`"" block, then move down to the door and place it next to the door to create ""door is win."" Then, I can move to the door to win the level.

Let me start by moving right to get closer to the ""rule `win`"" block.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and one step up. Then there's a ""rule `win`"" one step up. There's also a door one step to the left and two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" one step to the left and three steps down. Additionally, there's a ""rule `baba`"" two steps to the left and four steps down, another ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and four steps down, a ""rule `you`"" four steps down, and a ball two steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, so the ""WIN"" rule is one step up from my current position. If I move up, I might be able to reach it. But wait, I need to make sure that moving up doesn't lead me into any obstacles or if there are any other rules that might affect my movement.

I also notice there's a door nearby. Doors in Baba Is You usually require a key or some action to open. The ""rule `door`"" is three steps down from the door's position, which might mean that the door has some property defined by that rule. Maybe the door is ""STOP"" or something else that prevents me from moving through it unless I change the rules.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in the game can sometimes be moved or used to trigger certain actions. I'm not sure if the ball is relevant here, but it's good to note its position.

I also see multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks. These could be used to create new rules by moving them next to other objects. For example, if I can move a ""rule `is`"" block next to the door, I might be able to redefine the door's properties.

Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. My goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object, so moving up seems like a good start. But I should check if there are any blocking rules or if moving up will lead me into a dead end.

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is one step up. If I move up, I might be able to interact with that rule. Maybe I can change the win condition or move the ""WIN"" object somewhere else. Alternatively, moving up could take me directly to the ""WIN"" object, ending the level.

I should also consider if there are any other rules that might affect my movement. For example, if the door has a rule that makes it ""STOP,"" I might need to change that rule before I can pass through. But since the door is one step to the left and two steps down, and I'm currently at a position where moving up would take me towards the ""WIN"" rule, maybe I don't need to worry about the door right now.

Another thing to consider is the ""rule `you`"" four steps down. If I move down four steps, I might be able to interact with that rule, potentially changing what ""you"" is. But since my goal is to reach ""WIN,"" moving up seems more immediate.

I think the best course of action is to move up to reach the ""WIN"" rule. If that doesn't work, I can then consider moving other rule blocks to create new rules or change existing ones. But for now, moving up is the most straightforward approach to try and win the level.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like a good target. But wait, there's also a door nearby. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe another rule. Let me check the other rules.

There's a ""door"" rule one step to the left and three steps down. Hmm, that might mean the door has some property defined by that rule. Also, there's another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, and a ""you"" rule four steps down. I'm not sure what those do yet.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe it's part of a puzzle where I need to move it somewhere. But right now, my immediate goal is to reach the ""win"" object.

Since the ""win"" is one step up, I should try moving up. But I need to make sure there's nothing blocking me. Let me visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and the ""win"" is directly above me. There's a door one step to the left and two steps down, so it's not in my way. The other rules are further down, so they shouldn't interfere with moving up.

Wait, but if I move up, will I trigger any other rules? The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. If I move up, I might be near that rule. Maybe I can use it to change something. But for now, I just need to reach the ""win.""

So, the best course of action is to move up to reach the ""win"" object and complete the level. I don't see any immediate obstacles, so moving up should work.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and one step up. Then there's a ""rule `win`"" one step up. There's also a door one step to the left and two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" one step to the left and three steps down. Additionally, there's a ""rule `baba`"" two steps to the left and four steps down, another ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and four steps down, a ""rule `you`"" four steps down, and a ball two steps to the right and four steps down.

Hmm, so the ""WIN"" rule is one step up from my current position. If I move up, I might be able to reach it. But wait, I need to make sure that moving up is possible and doesn't lead to any obstacles or immovable objects. Let me visualize the map a bit.

I'm assuming that the ""rule `is`"" blocks are part of the rule definitions. So, ""baba is you"" is the main rule, meaning I can move as Baba. The ""rule `win`"" being one step up suggests that moving up will take me to the win condition. But I should also consider if there are any other rules that might affect my movement or the win condition.

Looking at the other rules, there's a ""rule `door`"" which might define the door's properties. If the door is defined as something like ""door is stop,"" then it would block my path. But I don't see that rule here, so maybe the door isn't an obstacle. The ""rule `baba`"" two steps to the left and four steps down could be another rule that defines Baba's properties, but since the main rule is ""baba is you,"" that might take precedence.

The ""rule `you`"" four steps down might define what ""you"" is, but since I'm already ""you"" via the main rule, I'm not sure how that affects things. The ball two steps to the right and four steps down is probably just an object, but without a rule defining its behavior, it might not do anything unless I interact with it.

So, focusing back on the win condition. If I move up, I can reach the ""rule `win`"" block. But in Baba Is You, moving onto a rule block usually allows you to change the rule or interact with it. Since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" moving onto ""rule `win`"" might let me change the win condition or perhaps end the level.

Wait, but I'm not sure if moving up is the right move. Maybe I should first check if there are any other rules that could help me. For example, if I can create a new rule that makes the door passable or changes the win condition to something else, that might be useful. But given the current setup, it seems straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I should move left or right to see if there are other rule blocks I can manipulate. The ""rule `is`"" one step to the left and one step up is close to me. If I move left and up, I can reach that rule block. Maybe changing that rule could affect something else.

But considering the goal is to win, and the ""rule `win`"" is directly above me, moving up seems like the most direct approach. I should try that first. If moving up doesn't work, then I can consider other options.

Another thing to consider is whether moving up will actually trigger the win condition. In some levels, you have to stand on the ""WIN"" block for it to activate. So, moving up to that position should be sufficient.

I think I'll go with moving up to reach the ""rule `win`"" block and see if that completes the level.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules around. I need to figure out how to get to the win.

The door is one step to the left and two steps down. There's a rule ""door"" one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe that rule affects the door's behavior. If I can manipulate the rules, I might be able to change how the door works or make it moveable.

There's also a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That might be a way to change Baba's properties. And another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down, which is probably where I started. And there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the win. Since the win is one step up, maybe I can just move up. But I need to check if there's anything blocking me. If I move up, will I hit a wall or another object?

Wait, the door is to the left and down. Maybe I need to go around it. Let me plan my path. If I move left, then down, I might be able to get around the door and reach the win from another direction.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the door passable or to change the win condition. For example, if I can make ""door is win,"" then going through the door would win the level. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me think about the rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. If I can move the ""win"" rule, I might be able to place it somewhere else. But I can't move the ""win"" rule because it's an active rule. Or can I?

Wait, the ""win"" rule is one step up. If I move up, I might be able to pick it up or change it. But I'm not sure how rule manipulation works exactly. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

There's an ""is"" rule one step to the left and one step up. If I can move that, I could potentially create a new rule by placing it next to another object. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the door, I could make ""door is something.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should focus on moving towards the win first. Let me try moving up and see what happens. If that's blocked, I'll have to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left to get around the door. Let me try moving left first. If I move left, I might be able to go around the door and reach the win from the other side.

Wait, the door is one step to the left and two steps down. If I move left, I'll be next to the door. Then, moving down twice would take me past the door. But I don't know if the door is passable or not. Maybe I need to change the door's properties first.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should try moving up first and see if I can reach the win directly. If not, I'll adjust my strategy.

Another thought: the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe the ball can be used to trigger something or move a rule. But I'm not sure how to utilize it yet.

I think the best course of action is to move up towards the win. If that's blocked, I'll try moving left to go around. Let's try moving up first.

The ""rule `win`"" is one step up, so that's probably the win condition. There's also a door, another rule `door`, and a ball further down.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks. Since I can only move objects that aren't ""STOP"" or similar, I need to see which ones are movable. The ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `win`"" are probably movable because they're just text blocks.

Maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" closer to me so I can reach it. Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by rearranging the text blocks. For example, if I can move ""win"" next to ""door,"" maybe I can make ""door is win,"" which would mean opening the door would win the level.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. The current win condition is ""rule `win`"" one step up. If I can move that closer, I can step on it to win. Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition by creating a new rule.

I also see a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe the ball is part of another rule or can be used to trigger something. But I'm not sure how yet.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a door, a ball, and several rule blocks. The rule blocks are important because moving them can change the rules of the level. Let me list out the objects and their positions:

- rule `is` is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from me.
- rule `win` is 1 step up.
- door is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.
- rule `door` is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down.
- rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down.
- rule `is` is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down.
- rule `you` is 4 steps down.
- ball is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down.

Hmm, so the ""win"" rule is just above me. If I can reach it, maybe I can change the win condition. But I'm not sure yet. The door is to the left and down, and there's a rule block for ""door"" below it. Maybe I can manipulate the door's properties.

I notice there's a ball to the right and down. Balls in Baba Is You often have specific behaviors, like pushing or being pushed. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach something.

The rule `you` is 4 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what ""you"" is, which could affect how I move or what I can do.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Since the ""win"" rule is up, maybe moving up is a good start. But I need to see if there's a path.

Wait, the door is to the left and down. If I move left, I might be able to interact with the door or the rule blocks related to it. Maybe I can make the door open or change its properties.

Alternatively, moving right towards the ball could be useful. If I can push the ball or change its rules, it might help me reach higher places or break through walls.

I'm a bit confused about the exact layout. Let me try to visualize it. I'm at the starting position, and the ""win"" rule is directly above me. To the left, there's a door and some rule blocks. To the right, there's a ball. Down from me, there are more rule blocks.

If I move up, I might reach the ""win"" rule, but I'm not sure if that's the goal yet. Maybe I need to change the rules first. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I can win by being myself. But how?

I think I need to move the rule blocks to create new rules. For instance, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" I might create ""baba is win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block.

Looking at the rule `is` positions, one is to the left and up, and another is to the left and down four steps. Maybe I can move the closer ""is"" block up to combine it with ""win.""

Wait, if I move up, I can reach the ""is"" rule that's one step up. Then, maybe I can move it to the right or left to create a new rule.

Alternatively, moving left might let me access the door and its rule block. If I can make the door open or change its properties, I might gain access to new areas.

I'm also noticing the ball is quite far down to the right. Maybe I need to go down first to reach it, but that might not be the quickest path.

Let me try to plan a sequence of moves. First, move up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, move right or left to combine it with another rule block to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""is"" block next to ""win"" could make ""baba is win,"" which would let me win by being myself.

But I need to make sure I can move the ""is"" block. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped by a rule. I don't see a ""stop"" rule, so I should be able to move the ""is"" block.

So, the plan is: move up to get the ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" Once that's done, I can move to the ""win"" object to win the level.

Alternatively, if moving up isn't possible due to some rule I'm missing, I might need to adjust my approach. Maybe I need to move left first to access other rule blocks.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is below the door. If I can change the door's properties, maybe I can open it or make it into something else. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" the door might become passable.

But I'm not sure how to do that yet. I think focusing on the ""win"" rule first might be more straightforward.

So, I'll try moving up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move it to the right or left to combine it with ""win."" Let's say I move up, then right to place the ""is"" next to ""win,"" creating ""baba is win.""

Once that rule is active, I can move to the ""win"" object to win the level. That seems like a solid plan.

I should also consider if there are any obstacles. The door is to the left, but if I don't need to go through it, maybe I can ignore it for now. The ball is far down, but again, if I can win without it, that's better.

So, the first step is to move up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, move it next to ""win"" to create the new rule. After that, move to ""win"" to complete the level.

I think that's the best course of action. Let's try it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up. So if I can get to that position, maybe I can win. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe changing a rule.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I move that rule, I can change what the door does. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. If I move that, maybe I can change Baba's properties.

The ""is"" rule is in a couple of places. One is one step to the left and one step up, and another is one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe moving these can help create new rules.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can get to that, maybe I can change who is ""you."" There's also a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to trigger things.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" rule. It's one step up, so maybe I can go up. But I need to check if there's anything blocking me. If I move up, will I hit a wall or another object? The door is two steps down, so maybe I can go around it.

Alternatively, maybe I should manipulate the rules first. If I can change the ""door"" rule, perhaps I can make the door openable without a key. Or maybe change the ""baba"" rule to give Baba some ability, like jumping or pushing.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is close to the ""win"" rule. If I move the ""is"" rule up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""win is something."" That could change the win condition.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should first try to move towards the ""win"" rule. Let me try moving up. If that doesn't work, I'll think about changing the rules.

Another idea: the ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can push the ball to hit something or create a new rule. But I'm not sure how to do that yet.

I think the best first step is to move up towards the ""win"" rule. If that's blocked, I'll adjust my plan.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up. So if I can get to that position, maybe I can change the win condition or something. There's also a door two steps down, and a rule that says ""door is something"" three steps down. Hmm, maybe I can manipulate the door's properties.

I see a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That might be a way to change Baba's properties. There's another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, and a ""you"" rule four steps down. Also, there's a ball two steps to the right and four steps down. I wonder if the ball can be used somehow.

Since I'm Baba, I can move around. Let me try to get closer to the ""win"" rule. If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" rule. But wait, moving up might not be the best idea because I need to see what other rules I can change.

Alternatively, maybe I should move left to access the ""baba"" rule. If I change Baba's properties, I might gain new abilities. For example, if I make Baba into a door or something else, I could unlock new paths.

Wait, there's a door two steps down. If I can make the door open or change its properties, I might be able to pass through it. The ""door"" rule is three steps down, so maybe I can move there and change it.

I'm a bit confused about the exact positions. Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting point, moving up would take me to the ""win"" rule. Moving left would take me towards the ""baba"" rule. Moving down would take me towards the door and other rules.

I think the best approach is to move left to access the ""baba"" rule. If I can change Baba's properties, I might be able to do more things, like push objects or change the win condition. So, I'll try moving left.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and one step up. That seems like where I need to go. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, maybe a key or another rule. Let me check the other rules.

There's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Hmm, maybe that defines the door's properties. Then there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. That might be another instance of Baba or a rule related to Baba. The ""is"" rule is also present in multiple places, which could be used to create new rules by moving them around.

The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and four steps down. Since ""baba is you,"" moving ""you"" might change what I control. There's also a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be moved or used to trigger things.

I think the key here is to manipulate the rules to change how Baba behaves or to create a new rule that allows me to reach the win. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine it with another object to form a new rule.

Let me visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, moving up would take me to the ""is"" rule. If I move right and up, I reach the ""win"" rule. But there's a door two steps down, which might block my path. Maybe I need to open the door first.

To open the door, I might need to create a rule that makes the door openable. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door, I could create a rule like ""door is open."" That would allow me to pass through.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""you"" rule to change what I control. If I make ""baba is win,"" then Baba would become the win condition, which might not help. Or maybe ""baba is door"" would let me turn into a door.

Wait, the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I can move the ball into a position where it can trigger a rule change, that might help.

Let me think step by step. First, I need to get to the ""win"" rule. But the door is in the way. So, I should figure out how to open the door. To do that, I might need to create a rule that makes the door openable.

I can move the ""is"" rule from one step up to next to the door. So, if I move up, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and then move it next to the door. That would create a new rule ""door is open,"" allowing me to pass through.

Once the door is open, I can move right and up to reach the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, if I can't open the door, maybe I can find another path or change the win condition.

Another idea: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever Baba goes, it's considered a win. But I'm not sure if that's the case. It might be better to focus on opening the door.

So, the plan is: move up to get the ""is"" rule, then move it next to the door to create ""door is open."" Once the door is open, move through it and then to the ""win"" rule.

Let me check the positions again. The ""is"" rule is one step up. The door is two steps down. So, moving up, then down twice would get me to the door. But I need to carry the ""is"" rule with me.

Wait, can I carry the ""is"" rule while moving? I think so. So, I move up to pick up ""is,"" then move down twice to the door's position. Then, I place the ""is"" next to the door, creating ""door is open.""

After that, I can move through the door. Then, I can move right and up to reach the ""win"" rule. That should solve the puzzle.

Alternatively, if moving the ""is"" rule doesn't work, maybe I can use the ball to push the door open. But I'm not sure how that would work without a rule change.

I think the best approach is to create a new rule to open the door. So, I'll move up to get the ""is"" rule, then move down twice to the door, and place the ""is"" next to it. That should open the door, allowing me to proceed to the win.

Let me try that. First, move up to get the ""is"" rule. Then, move down twice to the door's location. Now, I'm next to the door with the ""is"" rule. Placing it here creates ""door is open."" Now, the door is open, and I can move through it.

Once through the door, I can move right and up to reach the ""win"" rule. That should complete the level.

I think that's the solution. So, the actions would be: up, down, down, right, up.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules around. I need to figure out how to get to the win.

The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. There's also a ""door"" object one step to the left and two steps down. Maybe I need to manipulate the door somehow. If I can make the door open or change its properties, that might help me reach the win.

There's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down. That's probably another Baba or a rule related to Baba. Also, there's an ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, and a ""you"" rule four steps down. Maybe moving these can change the rules in my favor.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Not sure how that plays in yet, but maybe it's a distraction or part of a different rule.

I think the key is to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that can help me. For example, if I can make ""door is open"" or something like that, I might be able to pass through it. Alternatively, maybe I can change the win condition to something else.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule that's one step to the left and four steps down. If I move it up, maybe I can combine it with another word to form a new rule. Or perhaps moving the ""door"" rule could change the door's properties.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the door, maybe I can create ""door is open."" That would make the door passable. Let me see how to do that. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. If I move the ""is"" rule up one step, it would be next to the ""door"" rule, forming ""door is [something]."" But I need to make it ""door is open.""

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""open"" word somewhere, but I don't see it on the map. Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing rules to my advantage. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba to manipulate the rules.

Let me try moving up to get closer to the ""win"" rule. If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" object directly. But is there something blocking me? The door is to the left and down, so maybe I don't need to go through it right now.

Wait, if I move up, I might be able to reach the ""win"" without dealing with the door. Let me check the positions again. The ""win"" is one step up, so moving up should get me there. But why is the door and other rules present? Maybe the win is behind the door, or perhaps the door is a red herring.

Alternatively, maybe the win is not directly accessible because of some rule. If ""baba is you,"" I can move as Baba, but perhaps the door is blocking the path. Let me see: the door is one step to the left and two steps down. If I move left and down, I can reach the door. But without knowing its properties, I don't know if I can open it.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. So the rule is ""door is [something]."" If I can change that rule, I might be able to make the door open. For example, if I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through it.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the door. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. If I move it up three steps, it would be next to the ""door"" rule. But moving it up three steps from its current position would require me to move it up, but I'm not sure how that works in the game.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule up to meet the ""is"" rule. The ""door"" rule is one step to the left and three steps down. If I move it up one step, it would be one step to the left and two steps down, which is where the door object is. That might not help.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try moving up to see if I can reach the win directly. If that doesn't work, then I'll focus on manipulating the door.

Let me try moving up. If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" rule, which is one step up. That might be the simplest solution. But I'm not sure if there's a rule preventing me from winning directly.

Alternatively, maybe the win is not the actual win condition because of some rule. For example, if ""win is lose,"" then winning would make me lose. But I don't see such a rule here.

Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you."" So the win should be the win condition. Let me try moving up to win.

But in the previous attempts, moving up didn't work. Maybe I need to adjust the rules first. Let me see: if I can make ""win is you,"" then I can win by being myself. But I don't see a ""you"" rule nearby the ""win"" rule.

The ""you"" rule is four steps down. If I can move it up to meet the ""win"" rule, I can create ""win is you,"" which would mean that being Baba (since ""baba is you"") would make me the winner. That could work.

So, the plan is: move the ""you"" rule up four steps to be next to the ""win"" rule, forming ""win is you."" Then, since ""baba is you,"" I can win by being myself.

But how do I move the ""you"" rule? I need to move it up four steps. Let me check the positions. The ""you"" rule is four steps down. So, moving it up four steps would bring it to the same level as the ""win"" rule, which is one step up from my current position.

Wait, no. The ""you"" rule is four steps down from where? From the starting point? Or from the ""win"" rule? I think it's four steps down from the starting position. So, moving it up four steps would bring it to the starting level.

But the ""win"" rule is one step up. So, I need to move the ""you"" rule up four steps and then one step up to be next to the ""win"" rule. That might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to meet the ""you"" rule. The ""win"" rule is one step up. If I move it down four steps, it would be three steps down from the starting point, which is where the ""door"" object is. Not sure if that helps.

This is tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that can help me. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then being Baba would make me the winner.

The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to it, I can create ""baba is win."" But moving the ""win"" rule might be difficult.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""is"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. If I move it up four steps, it would be one step to the left and at the same level as the ""baba"" rule. Then, the rule would be ""baba is [something]."" If I can make it ""baba is win,"" that would solve the puzzle.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to move it up four steps. Let me see: the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. Moving it up four steps would bring it to one step to the left and at the same level as the starting point. Then, I can move it right to be next to the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. So, if I move the ""is"" rule up four steps, it would be one step to the left. Then, moving it left one more step would align it with the ""baba"" rule, making ""baba is [something]."" If I can place ""win"" next to it, then ""baba is win.""

But I'm not sure how to move the ""win"" rule. Maybe it's easier to move the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is two steps to the left and four steps down. If I move it right two steps, it would be at the starting level. Then, moving the ""is"" rule next to it could form ""baba is [something].""

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try moving up to see if I can win directly. If that doesn't work, I'll focus on changing the rules.

I'll try moving up. If that doesn't work, I'll adjust the rules accordingly.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `win` 1 step up,"" which probably means the win condition is one step up from where that rule is placed. I also see a door and a ball, which might be part of the puzzle.

I need to figure out how to move the rule blocks to change the rules in my favor. Since I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar, I should look for movable rule blocks. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are probably movable because they define the ""is"" relationship, which is essential but can be manipulated.

I notice there are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""win,"" I might be able to change what ""win"" means. Alternatively, moving ""rule `door`"" could change the door's properties.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe it's a distraction or part of a different rule. I should focus on the win condition first.

I think the best approach is to move towards the ""rule `win`"" block. If I can get next to it, I might be able to change the win condition to something else or make it easier to reach. Since the win rule is one step up, I should move up to see if I can interact with it.

Wait, but I'm currently at the starting position. Let me visualize the map. The ""rule `win`"" is one step up, so if I move up, I might be able to grab it or move it somewhere else. Alternatively, moving left or right could help me access other rule blocks that can change the game's rules.

I also see a ""rule `baba`"" two steps to the left and four steps down. Maybe moving that could change what Baba is, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" that's probably not necessary right now.

Another thought: if I can move the ""rule `door`"" block, I might be able to open the door or change its properties. The door is one step to the left and two steps down, so maybe I can move towards it and see if I can manipulate it.

But I think the priority is to reach the win condition. So moving up towards the ""rule `win`"" block seems like the best first step. Let me try moving up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what I have here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a door and a ball. The door is one step to the left and two steps down from my current position. There's also a rule ""door"" which is one step to the left and three steps down. Hmm, that might mean that the door has some property defined by that rule. Maybe I can manipulate that.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet. There are also several ""is"" rules scattered around. One is one step to the left and one step up, another is one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can move these to create new rules.

I think the key here is to change the rules to make the door or the ball do something useful. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and pick up or move these rule blocks. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the door, maybe I can redefine what the door does. For example, if I make ""door is win,"" then the door would become the win condition, which I can then reach.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into something else. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I could control the ball and use it to reach the win. But I'm not sure if that's possible with the current setup.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ""is"" rule that's one step to the left and one step up. If I move up, I can reach that ""is"" block. Then, I can move it down to the door's position to create a new rule. So, first, I'll move up to get the ""is"" block.

Wait, but moving up might not be the best idea because I need to get to the door eventually. Maybe I should move left first to get closer to the door and the ""is"" rule. Let me see: moving left would bring me closer to the door and the ""is"" rule at one step to the left and one step up. So, moving left first makes sense.

After moving left, I can then move up to get the ""is"" block. Once I have that, I can move it down to the door's position, which is one step to the left and two steps down from my current position. That way, I can create a new rule like ""door is win,"" making the door the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the ball's position to make the ball into something else. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. The door seems more straightforward since it's closer.

So, my plan is: move left to get closer to the ""is"" rule, then move up to pick it up, and then move it down to the door to create a new rule. That should help me win the level.

Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. So, I need to break this down into individual moves. First, I'll move left to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, I'll move up to pick it up. After that, I'll move down towards the door to place the ""is"" block there.

Let me visualize the map. I'm currently at a position where the ""is"" rule is one step to the left and one step up. So, moving left once will bring me closer, and then up once to get the ""is"" block. Then, moving down twice to reach the door's position. That should do it.

I think that's the best course of action. So, my first move should be to the left to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target I need to reach. But wait, there's also a door and some other rules that might affect how I can move or what I can do.

I see a door one step to the left and two steps down. There's also a rule ""door"" one step to the left and three steps down. Maybe that door has some property defined by that rule. If I can manipulate the rules, I might be able to change how the door behaves or how I can interact with it.

There's a ""baba"" rule two steps to the left and four steps down, and another ""is"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Also, a ""you"" rule four steps down. Hmm, maybe I can move these rules around to create new properties or change existing ones.

The ball is two steps to the right and four steps down. I'm not sure what the ball does yet, but maybe it's part of the puzzle.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" rule since that's the goal. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles or necessary rule changes to get there. Let me check the positions again.

If I move up, I can reach the ""win"" rule directly. But is there anything blocking me? The door is to the left and down, so maybe it's not in my way. However, the ""door"" rule is further down, so perhaps the door has some property that could affect my path.

Wait, if I move up, I might be able to reach the ""win"" without any issues. But I should also consider if changing any rules could make the path easier or unlock something else. For example, if I can make the door into something else, like a pushable block, I might need to move it out of the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""baba is you"" rule to something else to gain different abilities. But since I'm already controlling Baba, that might not be necessary unless I need to change my properties.

I think the simplest approach is to move up towards the ""win"" rule. Let me try that.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba object. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" block, but I need to check if that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""WIN"" rule one step up from my current position. That seems like the target. There's also a door two steps down, and some other rules like ""door is door"" and ""baba is you"" again. There's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down, but I'm not sure how that plays into this.

Wait, the ""WIN"" rule is just one step up. So if I move up, I should reach it. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles. The door is two steps down, but since I'm moving up, that shouldn't block me. The other rules are just defining properties, so they shouldn't interfere with my movement.

I think the best course of action is to move up to reach the ""WIN"" block. That should complete the level. Let me double-check: moving up from my current position will take me to the ""WIN"" rule, which is one step up. There's nothing stopping me from moving there, so it should work.

So, I'll choose the ""up"" action to move towards the win condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and one step up. That seems like where I need to go. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, so maybe I need to manipulate the rules to open it.

There's a ""door"" rule three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what the door does. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can use that to change Baba's properties.

The ""is"" rule is four steps down, and ""you"" is one step to the right and four steps down. There's also a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push things or change rules.

Hmm, I think I need to move the ""door"" rule to make the door passable. If I can make the door ""is"" something else, like ""open,"" then I can go through it. But how?

Maybe I should move the ""is"" rule next to the door. If I can form a new rule like ""door is open,"" then the door would open. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is four steps down, and the door is two steps down. If I move the ""is"" rule up two steps, it would be next to the door. Then, I can move the ""door"" rule to make ""door is open.""

Wait, but I can only move one block at a time. So first, I need to move the ""is"" rule up. Let me check the positions. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, and the door is two steps down. So if I move the ""is"" rule up two steps, it would be at the same level as the door. Then, I can move the ""door"" rule to the right to form ""door is open.""

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to make it easier to reach. The ""win"" rule is one step to the right and one step up. If I can move it closer, I might not need to go through the door.

Wait, but the door is blocking the path to the win. So I probably need to open the door first. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up. To do that, I need to move it step by step. Each move is one step, so I need to plan the path.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. If I can push it to hit the door, maybe it will open. But I'm not sure if the ball can be pushed or if it affects the door.

I think the best approach is to manipulate the rules to make the door open. So I'll move the ""is"" rule up two steps to be next to the door. Then, I can move the ""door"" rule to form ""door is open."" Once the door is open, I can go through it and reach the win.

So, first, I need to move the ""is"" rule up. Let me see, the ""is"" rule is four steps down. To move it up, I need to move it step by step. Each move is one step, so I'll need to move it up four times to get it to the top. Wait, that might take too long. Maybe there's a quicker way.

Alternatively, I can move the ""door"" rule to the right to form a new rule. If I move the ""door"" rule to the right, it would be next to the ""is"" rule, making ""door is [something]."" But I need to define what it is. Maybe I can make ""door is open"" by moving the ""open"" rule next to it, but I don't see an ""open"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by moving the ""is"" rule next to the door. If I move the ""is"" rule up two steps, it would be next to the door, forming ""door is [something]."" Then, I can move another rule to complete it. For example, if I move the ""open"" rule next to ""is,"" it would make ""door is open.""

But I don't see an ""open"" rule. Maybe I can use the ""you"" rule. If I make ""door is you,"" then the door would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I make ""door is win,"" then the door would be the win condition, but that might not open it.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up to be next to the door. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule up two steps. Each move is one step, so I'll need to move it up twice. Let me plan the moves:

1. Move ""is"" up once.
2. Move ""is"" up again.

After these moves, the ""is"" rule will be next to the door. Then, I can move the ""door"" rule to the right to form ""door is [something]."" But I still need to define what it is. Maybe I can use the ""open"" rule, but I don't see it. Alternatively, I can use the ""you"" rule.

Wait, if I make ""door is you,"" then the door would become me, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I make ""door is win,"" then the door would be the win condition, but I'm not sure if that opens it.

Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the ""baba"" rule. It's one step to the left and four steps down. If I can move it to change Baba's properties, maybe I can become something else. For example, if I make ""baba is open,"" then I can open the door.

But how? I need to move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and then move another rule to complete it. Let me see, the ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. The ""is"" rule is four steps down. So if I move the ""baba"" rule to the right, it would be next to ""is,"" forming ""baba is [something].""

Then, I can move the ""open"" rule next to ""is"" to make ""baba is open."" But I don't see an ""open"" rule. Maybe I can use the ""win"" rule. If I make ""baba is win,"" then I would become the win condition, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is door,"" which would make me a door, but that doesn't seem useful.

Wait, perhaps I can use the ball. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. If I can push it to hit the door, maybe it will open. But I'm not sure if the ball can be pushed or if it affects the door.

So, the first move is to move the ""is"" rule up once. Then, move it up again. After that, move the ""door"" rule to the right to complete the rule ""door is open."" Once that's done, the door should open, and I can proceed to the win.

But wait, I can only make one move at a time. So, I need to choose the first action. The best first move is to move the ""is"" rule up once. That way, I can start forming the rule to open the door.

So, I'll choose to move the ""is"" rule up.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step up, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. That probably means the win condition is somewhere in that direction. There's also a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. So the door has some rule associated with it, maybe about how it behaves.

Then there's a ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down. That could be modifying Baba's properties. Another ""rule `is`"" four steps down, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and four steps down, which could affect how I'm controlled. Lastly, there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down.

I need to figure out how to move to change the rules or reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I can move around, but I can only move objects that aren't stopped by ""STOP"" or similar rules. I should check if any of these rule blocks can be moved to create new rules or modify existing ones.

First, I should probably move towards the ""rule `win`"" to see what it does. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the win condition. Alternatively, moving the ""rule `door`"" might allow me to open the door or change its behavior.

Wait, the door is two steps down, and the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. Maybe if I move the door's rule, I can make the door passable or change its properties. For example, if I can make the door ""IS OPEN"" or something like that, I might be able to go through it.

Alternatively, the ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down could be modified. If I move that rule, maybe I can change Baba's properties, like making Baba able to push objects or jump.

I also notice there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You often have specific behaviors, like rolling or breaking blocks. Maybe I can use the ball to help me reach the win condition or break through obstacles.

Let me think about the possible actions. I can move up, right, down, left, or idle. Since the ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up, moving right and up might get me closer to it. But I need to check if that's the best move.

Alternatively, moving down towards the door might be useful. If I can manipulate the door's rule, I might gain access to a new area or change the win condition.

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and four steps down. That could affect how I'm controlled. If I move that rule, maybe I can change my own properties, like making myself a different object or gaining new abilities.

I'm a bit confused about the exact layout, but based on the descriptions, I think moving towards the ""rule `win`"" is a good start. If I can move that rule, I might be able to redefine the win condition to something easier to reach.

So, I think moving up first would help me get closer to the ""rule `win`"" and the ""rule `is`"" block. That way, I can potentially create a new rule that changes the win condition or modifies another object's properties.

Alternatively, moving right might bring me closer to the ""rule `you`"" and the ball. If I can change my own properties, that could open up new possibilities.

Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think moving up is a safer bet to start manipulating the rules near the top of the map.

The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls can sometimes be used to push objects or change the environment. Maybe I can use the ball to move a rule block.

I think the key is to create a new rule that makes the door passable. If I can move the ""door"" rule to say ""door is open"" or something like that, I can go through it. Alternatively, I might need to change the win condition to something else if the door is blocking the way.

Let me plan my moves. I need to get to the ""win"" rule, but the door is in the way. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule up so that it's not blocking the path. Or perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""door"" to make a new rule.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule that's four steps down to the ""door"" rule, I can create ""door is something."" Maybe ""door is open"" would allow me to pass through. But how do I get there?

I'm at the starting position. Let me see the layout. The ""win"" is up and to the right. The door is down two steps. The ""door"" rule is three steps down. The ""baba"" rule is four steps down and to the left. The ""is"" rule is four steps down. The ""you"" rule is four steps down and to the right. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down.

I think I need to move down to access the rules. Let me go down first. Then, I can move left or right to reach the ""door"" rule or the ""is"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule to create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. But since I'm already ""baba is you,"" maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule that's four steps down to the ""door"" rule, which is three steps down, I can make ""door is something."" If I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through it. But how do I get the ""open"" part? Maybe I can use the ball to push the ""is"" rule into position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Let me try moving down first. So, I'll go down once. Now, I'm one step down. Then, I can move left or right. If I move left, I might reach the ""baba"" rule or the ""is"" rule. If I move right, I might reach the ""you"" rule or the ball.

Hmm, perhaps moving left to access the ""is"" rule. Let me go left once. Now, I'm at the ""is"" rule. If I can move this ""is"" rule up, I can combine it with the ""door"" rule. So, I'll move up. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the ""door"" rule, making ""door is something."" But what's the something? Maybe I can move another rule into that position.

Wait, I think I need to create a new rule like ""door is open."" To do that, I need to have ""door"" next to ""is"" and then ""open."" But I don't see an ""open"" rule. Maybe I can use the ball to represent ""open.""

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is push"" so that I can push it. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: if I can make ""win is door,"" then the door becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down so that it's next to the door. Then, when I reach the door, it becomes the win condition. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, I can try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. If I make ""baba is push,"" then I can push the door. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the ball ""is push,"" then I can push the door with the ball. But I'm not sure.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule. So, I'll move down to the ""is"" rule, then move it up to be next to the ""door"" rule. Now, the rule becomes ""door is something."" But I need to define what ""something"" is. Maybe I can move another rule into that position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door. So, when I reach the door, it becomes the win condition. Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is open"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the door and then moving another rule into that position.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule and see what happens. So, I'll move down to the ""is"" rule, then move it up to be next to the ""door"" rule. Now, the rule is ""door is something."" But I need to define what ""something"" is.

Wait, maybe I can make ""door is open"" by using the ball. If I can make the ball ""is open,"" then the door can be opened by the ball. But I'm not sure how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, making ""win is door,"" so that when I reach the door, I win. That might be a way to bypass the door.

Let me try that. I'll move the ""win"" rule down next to the door. Now, the rule is ""win is door."" So, the door becomes the win condition. Now, when I reach the door, I win. But how do I get to the door? It's two steps down, but maybe I can go around.

Wait, the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push the door. If I can make the ball ""is push,"" then I can push the door.

But I don't see a ""push"" rule. Maybe I can create one by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then moving another rule into that position.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""ball is push"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then moving the ""push"" rule into that position. But I don't see a ""push"" rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule to make ""door is something."" Then, I can move another rule into that position to define what ""something"" is.

If I can make ""door is open,"" then I can pass through it. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to the door, then move the ""open"" rule into that position. But I don't see an ""open"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving another rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""you"" rule. If I make ""door is you,"" then the door becomes me, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is pass,"" but I don't see a ""pass"" rule.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me try to move the ""win"" rule next to the door, making ""win is door."" Then, when I reach the door, I win. So, I'll move the ""win"" rule down next to the door.

Now, the rule is ""win is door."" So, the door becomes the win condition. Now, I just need to reach the door. But the door is two steps down. Let me try to go down twice. But wait, the door is blocking my path. So, I can't just walk through it unless it's open.

Wait, maybe if I make ""door is open,"" I can pass through. So, I'll move the ""is"" rule next to the door, then move the ""open"" rule into that position. But I don't have an ""open"" rule. Maybe I can create it by moving another rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. If I can make the ball ""is open,"" then the door can be opened by the ball. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can make ""ball is open"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then moving the ""open"" rule into that position. But again, I don't see an ""open"" rule.

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try to move the ""baba"" rule to change my properties. If I can make ""baba is jump,"" I can jump over the door. But I don't see a ""jump"" rule.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""you"" rule. If I make ""you is push,"" then I can push the door. But I'm not sure.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to try moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule and see what happens. So, I'll move down to the ""is"" rule, then move it up to be next to the ""door"" rule. Now, the rule is ""door is something."" But without another rule, it doesn't do anything.

Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule into that position, making ""door is you."" That would mean the door is me, but I don't think that helps.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and one step up. That seems like where I need to go. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. I remember that doors usually require a key or some way to open them, but I don't see a key here. Maybe the door is part of the puzzle in some way.

There's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Hmm, maybe if I can manipulate the rules, I can change the door's properties. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. That might be a way to change what Baba is or does. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, which could be useful for creating new rules. The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and four steps down, which might affect how I'm controlled. And there's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down, which could be a movable object.

I think the key here is to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that can help me reach the win. Maybe if I can make Baba able to push the ball or something. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up to combine it with another rule. If I move the ""is"" rule up, I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something that changes the win condition.

Wait, but I need to get to the ""win"" object. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position. Or perhaps I can make the door into something else. If I can make the door into a ""win"" object, then maybe I can just walk through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into a ""you"" so I can control it and push it somewhere. But I'm not sure. Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up first. If I move it up, I can create a new rule that might help me.

So, I think the best action is to move up to get closer to the ""win"" rule and see if I can manipulate it.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is usually the ""WIN"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see several rule blocks and other objects. There's a ""rule `is`"" one step up, which might be part of another rule. The ""rule `win`"" is one step to the right and one step up. That probably means the win condition is somewhere in that direction. There's also a door two steps down, and a ""rule `door`"" three steps down. I'm not sure what that means yet.

Then there's a ""rule `baba`"" one step to the left and four steps down. That might be defining something about Baba. There's another ""rule `is`"" four steps down, which could be another part of a rule. The ""rule `you`"" is one step to the right and four steps down, and a ball is three steps to the right and four steps down.

I think I need to manipulate the rules to change how things work. Since I'm Baba, I can move around and push or move these rule blocks. Maybe if I move the ""win"" rule, I can change what I need to do to win. Or perhaps I can make the door open by changing its rule.

Let me try to visualize the map. If I'm at the starting position, the ""rule `is`"" is one step up, so that's probably above me. The ""rule `win`"" is diagonally up and to the right. The door is two steps down, so that's below me. The ""rule `door`"" is three steps down, which is below the door. The ""rule `baba`"" is to the left and four steps down, which is far to the left. The other ""rule `is`"" is four steps down, directly below me. The ""rule `you`"" is to the right and four steps down, and the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down.

I think I should start by moving towards the ""rule `win`"" to see if I can change the win condition. If I can move that rule, maybe I can set the win to something else, like the ball or the door. Alternatively, I could try to make the door open by changing its rule.

Wait, if I move the ""rule `door`"" three steps down, maybe I can make the door openable. Or perhaps I can make the door into something else. Since the door is two steps down, I can move there and see what happens.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""rule `is`"" four steps down to change another rule. Maybe that's part of a rule that's preventing me from doing something.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, I need to understand all the current rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I control Baba. The other rules are:

- rule `is` 1 step up: Maybe this is part of another rule, like ""something is something.""
- rule `win` 1 step to the right and 1 step up: This could be defining the win condition.
- door 2 steps down: The door is an object two steps below me.
- rule `door` 3 steps down: This might define the door's properties.
- rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down: Defines something about Baba.
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down: Another part of a rule.
- rule `you` 4 steps down: Defines something about ""you.""
- ball 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down: A ball is on the map.

I think I need to move the ""rule `win`"" to change the win condition. If I can move it to say ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would make me win. Alternatively, I could make the door the win condition.

Let me try to move towards the ""rule `win`"" which is one step up and one step to the right. So I should move up and right. But wait, I'm not sure if I can move diagonally. In Baba Is You, you can only move in one direction per step, so I need to move up first, then right, or right then up.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""rule `win`"" block to a new location. If I can move it, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move it next to the ball, it would say ""ball is win,"" which would change the win condition.

But how do I move the rule blocks? I can only move objects that are not defined as ""STOP."" Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba, but I need to see if the rule blocks are movable.

Wait, the rule blocks are text blocks, so they can be moved as long as they're not part of a rule that makes them immovable. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" the rule blocks should be movable.

So, I think the plan is:

1. Move towards the ""rule `win`"" block to pick it up or move it.
2. Move it to a new location to create a new rule, like ""ball is win.""
3. Then, go to the ball to win.

Alternatively, I could try to make the door open by changing its rule. If I move the ""rule `door`"" block, I can define the door's properties. For example, making it ""door is open"" would allow me to pass through.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me focus on changing the win condition first.

So, I need to move up and right to reach the ""rule `win`"" block. Let me try moving up first.

After moving up, I'm one step closer to the ""rule `win`"" block. Then, I can move right to reach it. Once I'm next to it, I can push it to a new location.

If I push it to the right, it would create a new rule. For example, if I move it next to the ball, it would say ""ball is win."" Then, reaching the ball would make me win.

So, the steps would be:

1. Move up to reach the ""rule `win`"" block.
2. Move right to push it next to the ball.
3. Then, move towards the ball to win.

Alternatively, I could move the ""rule `win`"" block to the door, making the door the win condition. Then, I just need to reach the door.

But I think making the ball the win condition is easier because the ball is farther away, and I might need to move through the door anyway.

Wait, the door is two steps down, and the ""rule `door`"" is three steps down. Maybe the door is closed, and I need to open it by changing its rule.

If I move the ""rule `door`"" block, I can define the door's properties. For example, making it ""door is open"" would allow me to pass through.

So, another plan:

1. Move down to reach the door.
2. Then, move down further to reach the ""rule `door`"" block.
3. Push it to change the door's rule to ""door is open.""
4. Then, go through the door to reach the win condition.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think again.

The current win condition is probably the ""WIN"" object, which is one step to the right and one step up from the ""rule `win`"" block. So, if I can reach that, I can win. But maybe it's easier to change the win condition to something else.

Alternatively, I could try to make myself into the ball or another object to reach the win condition.

Wait, the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I can make the ball into something else, like ""ball is you,"" so I can control it.

But I'm not sure if that's possible. Let me see.

If I can move the ""rule `ball`"" block, I can define the ball's properties. But I don't see a ""rule `ball`"" block in the list. So, maybe I need to create a new rule.

Alternatively, I can use the existing rule blocks to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ball to make ""ball is something.""

But I'm not sure. Let me try to focus on the initial plan of changing the win condition.

So, I'll move up to reach the ""rule `win`"" block, then move right to push it next to the ball, making ""ball is win."" Then, I just need to reach the ball to win.

But wait, the ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can find a shorter path.

Alternatively, I could make the door the win condition. If I change the rule to ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would make me win.

So, let me try that.

1. Move down to reach the door.
2. Then, move down further to reach the ""rule `door`"" block.
3. Push it to change the door's rule to ""door is win.""
4. Then, go through the door to win.

But I'm not sure if the door is open or closed. If it's closed, I might need to open it first.

Alternatively, I could make the door open by changing its rule. For example, ""door is open.""

So, the steps would be:

1. Move down to reach the door.
2. Move down further to reach the ""rule `door`"" block.
3. Push it to make ""door is open.""
4. Then, go through the door.
5. Finally, reach the win condition.

But I'm not sure where the win condition is. It might be behind the door.

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is the ball, and I need to reach it by going through the door.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the possible actions:

- Move up to reach the ""rule `win`"" block.
- Move down to reach the door and its rule block.
- Move left or right to reach other rule blocks.

I think the best approach is to try to change the win condition to something reachable. Let's try to make the ball the win condition.

So, I'll move up to reach the ""rule `win`"" block, then move right to push it next to the ball. That should create a new rule ""ball is win.""

Once that's done, I just need to reach the ball to win. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down, which is quite far. Maybe I can find a way to move there more easily.

Alternatively, I could make the ball into something else, like ""ball is push,"" so I can push it. But I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, if I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball will make me win, regardless of other rules. So, that might be the simplest solution.

So, the plan is:

1. Move up to reach the ""rule `win`"" block.
2. Move right to push it next to the ball, creating ""ball is win.""
3. Then, move towards the ball to win.

I think that's a feasible plan. Let me try that.

I see a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe if I can make Baba into a door or change the door's properties, I can open it. There's also a ""baba"" rule four steps down to the left, which might be useful for duplicating Baba or changing its properties.

The ""is"" rule is both one step up and four steps down. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and four steps down, which could be used to change what ""you"" is. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down, but I'm not sure how that plays into this yet.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to make the door openable. If I can make Baba into a key or change the door's property, I can proceed. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer or change it to something else.

Let me try moving the ""is"" rule up to create a new rule. If I move the ""is"" rule up, maybe I can form ""baba is win"" or something similar, which would make Baba the win condition. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule up, I can combine it with ""baba"" to make ""baba is win,"" which would mean that when I reach Baba, I win. But I'm already Baba, so that might not help. Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into something else.

Another idea: if I can move the ""door"" rule up, I can change its property. For example, making ""door is open"" or ""door is passable."" That way, I can walk through the door without needing a key.

Looking at the positions, the ""door"" rule is three steps down. If I move up, I can get closer to it. Maybe I should move up first to position myself better to manipulate the rules.

So, I think moving up is the best first step. It will bring me closer to the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule, giving me more options to change the rules in my favor.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule that's one step to the right and one step up from where I am. So, if I move right and up, I might reach the win. But wait, I also see a door two steps down. There's a rule for the door three steps down, which might mean the door has some property, maybe it's a barrier or something else.

There's also a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. That might be another instance of Baba or a rule that defines Baba's properties. The ""is"" rule is four steps down, and ""you"" is one step to the right and four steps down. There's a ball three steps to the right and four steps down, which might be an object I can interact with.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the map. I'm at the starting point, and the win is diagonally up-right. The door is two steps down, which might be blocking my path. The rules are spread out, so maybe I need to move some of them to change the game's rules.

Since I can only move objects that aren't ""stop,"" I need to see if any of these rules are movable. The ""is"" rule is one step up, so maybe I can move that. If I move the ""is"" rule, I could potentially change the active rules, which might help me reach the win.

Wait, if I move the ""is"" rule up, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something else that changes my properties. That could allow me to pass through the door or reach the win directly.

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""win"" rule to a different location. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, I can reach it without dealing with the door. But I'm not sure if the ""win"" rule is movable.

Let me think about the steps. I need to move towards the win, but the door is in the way. If I can change the door's properties, maybe I can open it or make it passable. The ""door"" rule is three steps down, so if I move that, perhaps I can redefine what the door is.

Another idea: if I can make Baba into a different object, like a ball, I might be able to roll through the door. The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. If I can move the ""baba"" rule to the ball's position, maybe I can become a ball.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is one step to the left and four steps down. If I move that to the ball's position, maybe I can change Baba into a ball. That could help me move differently.

But I'm not sure how to move the rules. I need to move the ""is"" rule first. Let me try moving up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Once I'm next to it, I can move it to a new location to create a new rule.

So, my plan is to move up to reach the ""is"" rule, then move it to the ball's position to create a new rule like ""ball is you."" That way, I can control the ball and maybe reach the win.

Alternatively, if I can't move the ""is"" rule, maybe I should try moving the ""win"" rule closer. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, another thought: if I can make the door into something else, like a win condition, then stepping on the door would win the level. The ""door"" rule is three steps down. If I can move that to the win's position, maybe I can redefine the door as the win.

But I'm not sure. Let me try moving up first to see if I can access the ""is"" rule. Once I'm there, I can decide the next steps.

So, I think the best first move is to go up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. That way, I can manipulate the rules to my advantage.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and one step up. That seems like where I need to go. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. I remember that doors usually require a key or something to open them, but I don't see a key here. Maybe the door is part of a rule that I can manipulate.

There's a ""door"" rule three steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change what the door does. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down. Maybe I can use that to change Baba's properties. The ""is"" rule is both one step up and four steps down. Maybe moving those can help create new rules.

The ""you"" rule is one step to the right and four steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can change what ""you"" is. There's also a ball three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change rules.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure there's a clear path. The door is in the way, two steps down. Maybe I can manipulate the door's rule to make it passable or change its behavior.

Alternatively, I could try to create a new rule by moving the ""is"" or ""you"" rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win,"" maybe I can make ""win"" something else. Or perhaps moving the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is.

Wait, if I move the ""baba"" rule to the left, maybe I can make Baba into something else, like a block or a key. That could help me bypass the door or change the win condition.

I'm a bit confused about the exact positions. Let me visualize the map. The ""win"" rule is one step right and up from my current position. The door is two steps down. The ""door"" rule is three steps down. The ""baba"" rule is one step left and four steps down. The ""is"" rule is both one step up and four steps down. The ""you"" rule is one step right and four steps down. The ball is three steps right and four steps down.

Hmm, maybe I should move up first to get closer to the ""win"" rule. But if I move up, I might be able to access the ""is"" rule that's one step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to another object, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, moving right could help me reach the ""win"" rule more directly. But I need to make sure there are no obstacles. The door is two steps down, so if I move down twice, I might hit the door. But without a key, I can't open it. Maybe I can change the door's rule to make it passable.

Wait, if I can move the ""door"" rule three steps down, maybe I can make the door into something else. For example, if I move the ""door"" rule next to ""is,"" I can create a new rule like ""door is something."" Maybe that can make the door passable or change its behavior.

Alternatively, I could try to move the ""is"" rule four steps down to combine it with other rules. Maybe that can help me create a new rule that benefits me.

I'm also noticing the ball three steps right and four steps down. Balls can be pushed, so maybe I can use it to push objects into new positions, helping me create new rules.

But I'm not sure if I should focus on the ball or the door first. Maybe the door is more urgent since it's blocking my path to the win condition.

Let me try to plan a sequence of moves. First, I'll move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move left or right to position the ""is"" rule next to another object to create a new rule.

Alternatively, I could move right to get closer to the ""win"" rule and see if I can manipulate it directly.

Wait, if I move right and up, I can reach the ""win"" rule. But I need to make sure that the win condition is something I can achieve. Maybe I can change the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule next to another object.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should try moving up first to access the ""is"" rule and see if I can create a new rule that helps me.

So, I think my first move should be up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. That way, I can potentially create a new rule that will help me progress towards the win condition or manipulate other objects like the door.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me see what's going on here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control the Baba character. My goal is to reach the win condition, which is probably the ""win"" object on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule one step to the right and one step up. That seems like where I need to go. But wait, there's also a door two steps down. Doors usually require something to open them, like a key or maybe changing a rule.

I see there's a ""door"" rule three steps down. Maybe I can manipulate that. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule one step to the left and four steps down, and another ""is"" rule four steps down. Hmm, maybe I can move these around to change the rules.

The ball is three steps to the right and four steps down. Balls in Baba Is You can sometimes be used to push objects or change rules by moving them into place.

So, my initial thought is to move towards the win condition. Since the win is one step right and up, I should probably move right first. But I also need to consider if there are any obstacles or if I need to change any rules before I can reach it.

Wait, the door is two steps down. If I move down twice, I might hit the door. But without knowing what's behind it, maybe I should check if I can open it. To open the door, I might need to change the rule so that Baba can pass through it or make the door openable.

Looking at the ""door"" rule three steps down, maybe I can move it or combine it with another rule. If I can make ""door is open"" or something like that, I might be able to pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push the door or another object into a position that changes the rules. The ball is three steps right and four down, which is a bit far, but perhaps moving towards it could help.

I think the best first step is to move right to get closer to the win condition. That way, I can assess if there are any immediate obstacles or if I need to adjust the rules before proceeding further.
