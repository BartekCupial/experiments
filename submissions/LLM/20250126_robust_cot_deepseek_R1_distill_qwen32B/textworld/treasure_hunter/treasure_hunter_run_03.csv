Okay, so I'm in this TextWorld game, and I need to find a specific object in a randomly generated maze. The goal is to explore different rooms and find the target object within 40 steps. Let me think about what I should do first.

The current observation says I'm in the Basement. There's a closed passageway leading south and an unblocked exit to the east. Also, there's an entranceway to the north that's unguarded. Hmm, so I have three possible directions: north, east, and south. But the passageway south is closed, so I can't go there yet without opening it. The exit east is unblocked, so I can go there. The entranceway north is unguarded, so that's another option.

I should probably start by looking around the current room to see if there's anything useful. The command 'look' will describe the current room. Maybe there are objects or containers here that could have the key I need to unlock the south passageway or other doors.

Wait, the target object might be in a closed or locked container, so I need to be prepared to unlock things. The key might be in another room or locked inside a container. So, taking the key whenever I can is important.

Since I'm just starting, I don't have any inventory yet. So, I should first look around to see if there are any objects I can take. Maybe there's a key here that I can use later.

So, the first step should be to use the 'look' command to get a better description of the Basement. That way, I can see if there are any objects or containers I can interact with. If there's a key, I can take it. If there's a container, I can try to open it, but I might need a key for that.

Alternatively, I could go east since that exit is unblocked. But without knowing what's there, it's safer to first look around the current room. Maybe there's a key or a clue that will help me later.

So, I think the best course of action is to use the 'look' command to explore the Basement thoroughly before moving on. That way, I can gather as much information as possible and plan my next steps effectively.

Okay, so I'm in the basement of this TextWorld game. The goal is to find a specific object, but I don't know what it is yet. Let me think about what I should do first.

The observation says there's a closed passageway leading south, an exit to the east, and an entranceway to the north that's unguarded. Hmm, so I can go north, east, or south. But the passageway south is closed, so I can't go there yet without opening it. The exit east is unblocked, so maybe I should go there first. The north entrance is also unguarded, so that's another option.

Wait, the user mentioned that the target object might be in a closed or locked container. So maybe I should look around for any containers or doors that might require keys. But right now, I don't see any containers mentioned in the observation. The only exits are north, east, and south, but south is closed.

I should probably explore the available exits first. Going east seems straightforward since it's unblocked. Maybe that room has something useful, like a key or another container. Alternatively, going north could lead to another area with more clues.

But before moving, maybe I should look around the current room more carefully. The command 'look' can describe the room in more detail. Maybe there are objects or containers I haven't noticed yet. The observation only mentions exits, but perhaps there are items on the floor or on supporters.

Wait, the initial observation didn't mention any objects, just the exits. So maybe I should try moving to another room to find more clues. Let's consider the options again: north, east, or south. South is closed, so I can't go there yet. So between north and east.

I think going east first might be a good idea. It's an unblocked exit, so it's safe. Maybe that room has a key or another door to unlock. Alternatively, going north could lead to a different area, but I don't know what's there yet.

Alternatively, maybe I should check the inventory to see if I have any keys. But since I just started, my inventory is probably empty. So I need to find a key somewhere.

Wait, the user mentioned that the key might be in another room or locked inside a container. So I need to explore to find the key. Since I can't go south yet, I should go either north or east.

I think going east is the next logical step. Let me try that.

2,look,"<think>
Okay, so I'm playing this TextWorld game, and I need to find a specific object in a maze. I just moved east from the basement into the kitchenette. Let me think about what I should do next.

First, I should probably look around the kitchenette to see what's there. The observation says it's an unusual room, but I don't have any details yet. Maybe there are objects or containers I can interact with. I remember that the target object might be in a closed or locked container, so I need to check for any such items.

I should use the 'look' command to get a better description of the room. That way, I can see if there are any doors, containers, or objects that might be relevant. If there's a container, I might need a key to unlock it, so I should keep an eye out for any keys or clues that could help me find one.

Also, I should consider the exits. The observation mentions an unblocked exit to the north and an exit to the west. Since I came from the east, going west would take me back to the basement. Maybe I should explore the north exit next, but before that, I should look around the kitchenette to see if there's anything useful here.

So, my plan is to first 'look' in the kitchenette to gather more information. If I find any objects or containers, I can decide whether to take them, open them, or look for keys. If not, I can then move north to explore further.

3,look,"<think>
Okay, so I'm in the Kitchenette now. Let me recap where I've been. I started in the Basement, then went east to get here. The Basement had exits north, east, and a closed passageway south. Now, in the Kitchenette, I see exits north and west. 

I need to find the target object, which I don't know yet, but I remember the goal is to find a specific object. So, I should explore as much as possible. 

Looking at the current room, the Kitchenette, I should probably look around to see if there's anything useful here. Maybe there are objects or containers that could have the target. 

The available commands are look, goal, inventory, go <dir>, open, drop, take, put, take from, insert, unlock. Since I just arrived, I should first use 'look' to get a better description of the room. That might reveal objects or exits I can interact with. 

Wait, the observation says ""You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the west."" So, exits north and west are open. But before moving, I should look around the Kitchenette to see if there's anything here. Maybe there's a key or a container that holds the target. 

So, the best course of action is to 'look' again to get more details about the room. That way, I can see if there are any objects to take or containers to open. If there's nothing here, then I can decide which direction to go next. 

I think 'look' is the right move now because it gives me more information about the current room, which is essential for making informed decisions about where to go next or what to do.

Okay, so I'm in the Kitchenette now. Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to find a specific object, but I don't know what it is yet. Maybe I should check the goal again to remind myself. Wait, I can use the 'goal' command to see what I'm looking for. That might help me decide where to go next.

Looking at the current observation, the Kitchenette has an unblocked entranceway to the north and an exit to the west. I came from the Basement by going east, so the west exit would take me back there. But I should explore other directions first.

I remember that in TextWorld, rooms can have objects, containers, or doors that might be locked. Since I'm in the Kitchenette, maybe there are some items here that could be useful. I should probably look around more carefully. The 'look' command gives a detailed description of the room, which might reveal objects or containers I can interact with.

Wait, I just used 'look' and the observation didn't change. Maybe I need to take a different action. Let me think about the possible commands again: look, goal, inventory, go <dir>, open, drop, take, put, insert, unlock.

I don't have any items in my inventory yet, so taking or dropping isn't an option. I should check if there are any doors or containers I can open or unlock. The observation mentions an entranceway to the north and an exit to the west, but nothing about doors or containers. Maybe I need to go north to explore further.

Going north might lead me to a new room where I can find the target object or a key to unlock something. Alternatively, I could go west back to the Basement, but that might not be helpful since I just came from there. It's better to explore new areas first.

So, I think the best course of action is to go north to see what's in that direction. That way, I can explore more rooms and potentially find the object I'm looking for.

Okay, so I'm playing this TextWorld game, and I'm trying to find the target object. Let me recap where I am. I started in the Basement, then went east to the Kitchenette, and now I'm in the Cookhouse. The goal is to find a specific object, but I don't know what it is yet. Maybe I should check the goal again, but I think I already did that earlier.

Looking at the current observation, the Cookhouse is described as a normal one. There are exits to the south and west. The south exit is unguarded, and the west entranceway is also unguarded. So, I can go either direction. But I need to decide which way to go next.

I remember that in the Basement, there was a closed passageway leading south. Maybe that's connected to the Cookhouse? Or perhaps the south exit from the Cookhouse leads somewhere else. I'm not sure yet. The west exit is another option, but I don't know what's there.

I should probably explore both directions to see where they lead. But since I have limited steps, I need to be efficient. Maybe I should go south first because the Basement's south passageway was closed, and now in the Cookhouse, the south exit is open. That might be a clue. Alternatively, going west could lead to a new area with more clues or the target object.

Wait, I also need to consider if there are any objects or containers in the Cookhouse. The description doesn't mention any, so maybe I should move on. But I should check the room again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me look around.

Hmm, the observation doesn't list any objects, so I probably don't need to take or interact with anything here. So, the next step is to choose a direction. Since I came from the Kitchenette, which was to the south of the Cookhouse, going west might be a new path. Alternatively, going south might loop me back or lead to another area.

I think I'll go west first to explore a new room. That way, I can cover more ground and maybe find the target object or a key needed to unlock something else. If I go south, I might end up back in the Kitchenette or another area I've already been to, which might not be as helpful.

So, my plan is to go west from the Cookhouse to explore the next room. That should help me progress towards finding the target object.

Okay, so I'm in the Laundromat now. Let me see what's going on here. The observation says there's a drawer, but it's empty. Then, when I lean against the wall, a secret button is pressed, and a shelf appears, but it's also empty. Hmm, that's a bit disappointing. But wait, there's a key on the floor. That's important because I remember the game requires me to find a specific object, which might be locked behind something. 

I need to figure out what to do next. The available commands are look, goal, inventory, go <dir>, open, drop, take, put, take from, insert, unlock. Since I just arrived here, I should probably check my inventory to see what I have. If I have a key, maybe I can unlock something else. But the key on the floor is new, so I should take it. 

Wait, the key is on the floor, so I can take it. That makes sense because keys are usually needed to unlock doors or containers. So, taking the key would be a good move. 

Looking at the exits, there's an exit to the east and south. But since I just came from the Cookhouse via west, going east would take me back to the Laundromat's east exit, which might lead somewhere else. But before moving, I should take the key. 

So, the best course of action is to take the key. That way, I can use it later if I encounter a locked door or container. 

I think I should choose the 'take key' action. That should help me progress towards finding the target object.

Okay, so I'm in the Laundromat now, and I just picked up a key. Let me think about what I should do next. The goal is to find a specific object, which I don't know yet, but I need to explore the maze to find it. 

Looking at the current observation, the Laundromat has an exit to the east and south. I came from the west, so going east would take me back to the Cookhouse, and south would take me back to the Kitchenette. But since I just got a key, maybe I should check if there are any locked doors or containers nearby that I can unlock.

Wait, the observation mentioned a drawer that was empty and a shelf that was also empty. There's a key on the floor, which I've already taken. So, maybe the key is for a door or another container in this room. But the room doesn't mention any locked doors or containers except the drawer, which was empty. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is needed for a door in another room. Since I came from the Cookhouse, maybe there's a locked door there that I can now open. Let me think about the previous rooms. In the Basement, there was a closed passageway leading south, which I didn't go through yet. Maybe that's where the target object is, but it's closed. I might need the key to unlock it.

So, my options are: go east back to Cookhouse, go south back to Kitchenette, or maybe look around again in the Laundromat. But since I already took the key, maybe I should go back to the Basement and try to unlock the passageway.

Wait, but how do I get back to the Basement? From the Laundromat, going east takes me to Cookhouse, and from there, I can go north to Basement. Alternatively, maybe I can go south to Kitchenette and then west back to Basement. Either way, I need to get back to the Basement to try unlocking the passageway.

But before I decide to move, I should check if there's anything else in the Laundromat. The observation says there's a key on the floor, which I've taken, and a drawer and a shelf, both empty. So, nothing else here. Therefore, the best course of action is to go back to the Basement and try to unlock the passageway leading south.

So, I should go east to Cookhouse, then north to Basement. Alternatively, go south to Kitchenette, then west to Basement. Either path would get me back. But since I'm in Laundromat, going east is shorter. Let me choose to go east first.

Wait, but the observation says there's an exit to the east and south. So, from Laundromat, east is Cookhouse, south is Kitchenette. I think going east is the way to go because it's closer to the Basement. So, I'll go east to Cookhouse, then north to Basement, and then try to unlock the passageway with the key I just picked up.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different door. But since the Basement's passageway is closed, it's a likely candidate. So, I'll proceed to go east.

Going west again would take me back to the Laundromat, but I already took the key there. Maybe I should look around the Cookhouse to see if there's anything else.

The command 'look' will describe the room again. Maybe there's something I missed. Let me try that. If there's a container or a door, I might need the key I found. Since I have the key, perhaps there's a locked door or container here that I can unlock.

Alternatively, maybe I should go south to the Kitchenette again to see if there's something I missed there. But I think I already explored that room. Hmm.

Wait, in the Laundromat, I found a key, but I don't know what it's for. Maybe it's for a locked door in the Cookhouse. Let me check the room description again. It says it's a normal cookhouse, so maybe there's a door or a container that's locked. If I 'look' again, maybe I can spot something.

If I see a locked door, I can try unlocking it with the key. If it's a container, I can open it after unlocking. But I need to make sure the key matches the lock. The key I have is just a 'key', so maybe it's a generic one, but sometimes keys have adjectives like 'non-euclidean' which need to match the lock.

I think the best course of action is to 'look' around the Cookhouse to see if there's anything I can interact with. If I find a locked door or container, I can use the key. If not, maybe I should explore another area.

Wait, the observation says there's an exit to the south and west. I've been to both, but maybe there's something else in the Cookhouse. Let me try 'look' again to get a detailed description.

In the Laundromat, I found a key on the floor and took it. Now, I'm back in the Basement. The Basement has a closed passageway leading south, an exit to the east, and an entranceway to the north. I think the closed passageway might be a door that's locked, and maybe the key I found can open it.

So, my goal is to find the target object, which I think is in a container somewhere. The key I have might be needed to unlock a door or a container. Since the passageway is closed, I should try to unlock it with the key.

Then I went east back to the Cookhouse, south back to the Kitchenette, west back to the Basement, and now I'm trying to unlock the passageway leading south with the key I found.

So, I used the command ""unlock passageway with key"" and it worked. Now, the passageway is unlocked, but it's still closed. The next logical step is to open it so I can go through. 

Looking at the available commands, I remember that after unlocking, I need to open the door. So the command should be ""open passageway."" That should allow me to move south into the new area, hopefully getting closer to the target object.

I don't see any other immediate actions needed here. I have the key, I've unlocked the passageway, now I just need to open it to proceed. There's no mention of any containers or other objects in the Basement that I need to interact with right now, so moving forward makes sense.

I should make sure I'm using the correct command. It's ""open passageway,"" not ""go south"" yet because the door is still closed even though it's unlocked. So, opening it first is necessary before I can move through.

Alright, I think that's the right move. Time to open the passageway and see where it leads.

I successfully unlocked the passageway, and now I need to decide what to do next. The passageway is now open, so I can go through it. But before I do that, I should check if there's anything else in the Basement that I might need. 

Looking at the current observation, the Basement has a closed passageway leading south (which I just opened), an exit to the east (which leads back to the Kitchenette), and an entranceway to the north (which I think leads back to the Cookhouse). Since I've already explored those areas, the next logical step is to go through the now-open passageway to the south. 

I should consider if there are any other actions I might need to take before moving on. For example, is there an object I need to take or a container to open? But from the previous observations, the Basement didn't mention any other objects besides the passageway. So, I think the best course of action is to go south through the passageway to explore the new area. 

I need to make sure I'm using the correct command. Since the passageway is now open, I can simply ""go south"" to move through it. I don't need to open it again because I already did that.

Since I'm in the Vault, it's likely that the target object is here or nearby. Maybe I should explore the other rooms connected to the Vault. The hatch to the east seems like a good option because it's open, and I haven't been there yet. 

Alternatively, I could go south through the portal, but I'm not sure where that leads. It might be better to check the hatch first. 

So, I think the best course of action is to go east through the hatch to explore that area next.

Okay, so I'm in the Lounge now. Let me see what's around. There's an open door leading south, an open hatch west, and an entranceway east. Also, there's a Henderson's limited edition key on the floor. Hmm, I remember from earlier that I had a key, but I'm not sure if it's the right one for any locked doors or containers. 

Wait, the key here is a Henderson's limited edition. Maybe that's the key I need for something. I should probably take it because it might be useful later. I don't have any other keys in my inventory, so this could be important. 

I should take the key first. Once I have it, I can explore other areas. Maybe the key is needed to unlock a door or a container in another room. I don't want to miss out on anything, so taking the key is the smart move here.

Okay, so I'm playing this TextWorld game, and I need to find a specific object. Let me recap where I am and what I've done so far. 

I started in a maze, went east into the Kitchenette, then north into the Cookhouse, west into the Laundromat where I found a key, went east back to the Cookhouse, south back to the Kitchenette, west into the Basement, unlocked and opened a passageway south into the Vault. In the Vault, I looked around and then went east into the Lounge, where I found a Henderson's limited edition key and took it.

Now, I'm in the Lounge with the key. The goal is to find a specific object, which I assume is the target object I need to retrieve. I remember that the target might be in a closed or locked container, so I need to explore further.

Looking at the Lounge description, there's an open door leading south, an open hatch leading west, and an open entranceway east. I just came from the east, so maybe I should explore the other directions. The door south and the hatch west are both open, so I can go through them without needing a key. But I also have the Henderson's key, which might be useful elsewhere.

Wait, the key I found in the Laundromat was just a regular key, but now I have this limited edition key. Maybe this key is needed to unlock something in another room. I should probably explore the Lounge first to see if there's anything else here.

I can use the 'look' command to get a better description of the Lounge. Maybe there are objects or containers here that I can interact with. If I find a locked container or door, I can try using the key I just picked up.

Alternatively, I could go south through the open door to see what's there. That might lead me closer to the target object. But since I have a new key, it's possible that the target is behind a locked door or container that requires this key. So, maybe I should first check if there's anything in the Lounge that needs unlocking.

I should also consider my inventory. I have the key from the Laundromat and now the Henderson's key. I need to make sure I don't drop any keys unless necessary. Maybe I should take a look around the Lounge to see if there's a container or door that matches the key's description.

If the Lounge doesn't have anything, then I can proceed to explore the other rooms using the open exits. But for now, I think it's best to 'look' around the Lounge to see if there's anything I can interact with before moving on.

Okay, so I'm in the Lounge now. Let me recap where I've been and what I've done so far. I started in the Kitchenette, then went north to the Cookhouse, then west to the Laundromat where I found a key. I went back east to the Cookhouse, then south back to the Kitchenette, and then west to the Basement. There, I used the key I found to unlock and open the passageway leading south into the Vault. In the Vault, I went east into the Lounge, where I found another key, the Henderson's limited edition key.

Now, in the Lounge, I see an open door leading south, an open hatch leading west, and an open entranceway leading east. I also notice that there's a Henderson's limited edition key on the floor, which I've already taken. So, my inventory now includes that key.

My goal is to find a specific object, but I'm not sure what it is yet. I should probably explore more rooms to find clues or the target object. Let me think about the possible directions I can go from here.

Going south from the Lounge leads to another room. I don't know what's there yet, so that's a possibility. Going west takes me back to the Vault, which I've already explored. Going east might lead to a new area. Since I want to explore as much as possible, maybe I should go east first to see what's there.

Alternatively, I could check if there are any containers or objects in the Lounge that I can interact with. But the observation doesn't mention any, so I might need to move on. I should also consider if the Henderson's key is needed for something else, like unlocking a door or container in another room.

Since I have the key, I should keep it in my inventory in case I encounter a locked door or container later. For now, exploring the new areas seems like the best approach. I'll choose to go east to see what's in that direction.

I have a key from the Lounge, so maybe I can use it somewhere else. But in the Canteen, the only thing mentioned is the empty plate and the exit. So, the best action here is probably to go west to continue exploring.

Okay, so I'm in the Lounge again. Let me recap where I've been and what I've done so far. I started in the Cookhouse, went west to the Laundromat, picked up a key, went back east to the Cookhouse, then south to the Kitchenette, west to the Basement, unlocked and opened the passageway to the Vault. In the Vault, I went east to the Lounge, took a key there, and now I'm back in the Lounge again.

The goal is to find a specific object, but I'm not sure what it is yet. I remember the initial instructions mentioned that the target object might be in a closed or locked container, so I need to keep that in mind. I have two keys now: the regular key from the Laundromat and the Henderson's limited edition key from the Lounge.

Looking at the current observation, the Lounge has exits south, west, and east. I've already been west to the Canteen, which didn't have anything useful except a plate with nothing on it. Going east leads back to the Vault, which I've already explored. So maybe I should go south this time.

Going south from the Lounge might lead to a new area. I don't have any information about what's there yet, so it's worth exploring. Plus, since I have two keys, maybe there's a locked door or container in the new room that I can unlock.

I should also check my inventory to make sure I have everything I need. I have the two keys, so I'm prepared to unlock any doors or containers I encounter. I don't see any immediate threats or obstacles, so moving south seems like a logical next step to continue exploring and find the target object.

Looking at the current observation, the Office has a closed Henderson's limited edition passageway leading west, an open door north, and an exit east that's unblocked. I have a Henderson's limited edition key in my inventory, which I picked up earlier in the Lounge. That key might be useful here.

The passageway is closed, so I probably need to unlock it. Since I have the key, I can try unlocking it. The key is a Henderson's limited edition, which matches the passageway's description. So, I should use the key to unlock the passageway.

After unlocking, I can open it and go west through the passageway. That might lead me closer to the target object. Alternatively, I could go north or east, but the passageway seems more promising since it's specifically mentioned as limited edition, which likely ties into the goal.

I think the best action is to unlock the passageway with the key I have. That should open it up for me to explore further.

I took a key earlier, which I used to unlock a passageway. Now, I'm in an office, and I just unlocked a passageway using the Henderson's limited edition key. The observation says I unlocked it, but I need to open it to proceed. 

Looking at the current observation, the passageway is now unlocked but still closed. So, the next logical step is to open it. Once it's open, I can go through it to explore further. 

I should check if there are any other actions needed, but since the passageway is the only exit mentioned, opening it makes sense. I don't see any other containers or objects to interact with in this room right now. 

So, the best course of action is to open the passageway to move forward and continue searching for the target object.

I started in the Cookhouse, then went south to the Kitchenette, then west to the Basement. In the Basement, I found a closed passageway leading south. I used a key to unlock it and opened it, which took me to the Vault. In the Vault, I saw a passageway north, a hatch east, and a portal south. I went east to the Lounge, where I found a key and took it. Then I went east again to the Canteen, which didn't have anything useful, so I went back west to the Lounge. From there, I went south to the Office. 

In the Office, there's a closed Henderson's limited edition passageway leading west. I just unlocked it using the key I found earlier. Now, the passageway is open. So, the next logical step is to go through it. 

I should check if there are any other exits or items in the Office, but the main goal is to find the target object. Since the passageway is now open, moving west makes sense to explore that new area. Maybe the target object is there. 

I don't see any other immediate actions needed, like taking items or unlocking more doors. So, the best course of action is to go west through the newly opened passageway.

Okay, so I'm in the Restroom in TextWorld. Let me try to figure out what to do next. The goal is to find a specific object, and I have 40 steps left. I need to explore different rooms to find it.

Looking at the current observation, the Restroom has a shiny counter, a chipped shelf, and a shiny board, but nothing's on them. So, there's nothing to take here. The exits are an open Henderson's limited edition passageway to the east, a closed balsam door to the west, and an open portal to the north.

I just came from the Office through the Henderson's limited edition passageway, which I unlocked and opened. Now, in the Restroom, I have three options: go east back to the Office, go west through the closed balsam door, or go north through the open portal.

Since I already came from the Office, going east might not be helpful unless I need to backtrack. The closed balsam door to the west is locked, so I can't go there yet. The portal to the north is open, so that's a new area to explore. Maybe the target object is there.

I should probably go north through the portal to see what's in that room. That way, I can continue exploring new areas and get closer to finding the target object.

Okay, so I'm in the Vault now. Let me try to figure out what to do next. I remember that the goal is to find a specific object, but I'm not sure what it is yet. Maybe I should check the goal again to make sure I'm on the right track. 

Looking around the Vault, there are three exits: north, east, and south. I came here from the south, so going back north would take me back to the Canteen. Going east would take me to the Lounge, and south would take me back to the Office. Hmm, I've already been to the Lounge and the Office, so maybe I should explore the other directions.

Wait, the goal might be in one of the other rooms. Let me think about where I've been. I found a key in the Lounge, which I used to unlock the passageway in the Office. Now I'm in the Vault, and I need to find the target object. Maybe it's in one of the other rooms connected to the Vault.

I should probably go east to the Lounge again, but I already checked there. Maybe I missed something. Alternatively, going south to the Office might have something else. But I just came from there. The north exit leads to the Canteen, which I also checked. 

Wait, maybe the target object is in the Vault itself. I should look around more carefully. Let me use the 'look' command to see if there's anything I missed. 

If I 'look', maybe I can find a clue or an object that I can take. Alternatively, maybe there's a container or a door that I can open with the key I have. I have the Henderson's limited edition key, which I used to unlock the passageway. Maybe there's another locked container here that I can unlock with it.

I should also check my inventory to see what I have. I have the key, but maybe there's another item I can use. If I 'inventory', I can see what I'm carrying. If I have any other keys or items, I can use them here.

Another thought: the target object might be in a container that's in the Vault. I should look for any containers or supporters that I can open or take items from. If I see a container, I can try to open it, maybe using the key if it's locked.

Wait, the observation says there's an open passageway north, an open hatch east, and an open portal south. So all exits are open. Maybe the target object is in one of those directions. I should try going through each exit to explore further.

I think the best course of action is to go east to the Lounge again, just in case I missed something there. Alternatively, I could go north to the Canteen or south to the Office. But since I've already been to the Lounge and the Office, maybe the Canteen is the next best option.

Wait, in the Canteen, I saw a plate but nothing on it. Maybe there's something else there. Or perhaps the target object is in the Vault itself. I should 'look' again to make sure I don't miss anything.

Alternatively, maybe I should go back to the Office and see if there's anything else there. But I just came from there. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. I need to decide which direction to go next to find the target object.

I think I'll go north to the Canteen first. Maybe there's something there I haven't noticed yet. If not, I can try the other directions.

Wait, I don't have a key for the balsam door. The only key I have is Henderson's limited edition key, which I used on the passageway. So maybe I need to find another key somewhere else. 

Let me think about the other rooms. In the Kitchenette, there was a drawer and a shelf, but both were empty. The Laundromat had a drawer and a secret shelf, also empty. The Cookhouse didn't mention any objects either. 

Maybe I should go back to the Office and see if there's anything else there. The Office had an open door north and an exit east. I went north to the Vault, but maybe I should go east from the Office. Wait, no, the Office's exits are north, east, and the passageway west. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to visualize the map. Starting from the Lounge, I can go south to the Office, west to the Restroom, or east to the Canteen. I've been to all those places. The Office leads north to the Vault, which connects to the Basement, Laundromat, and Kitchenette. The Restroom leads north to the Vault and west to a closed door. 

I think I need to explore the closed balsam door in the Restroom. But I don't have the key for it. Maybe the key is in another room. Let me check the Canteen again. The Canteen had a plate, but it was empty. 

Wait, maybe I should go back to the Basement. The Basement has an open passageway south to the Vault, an exit east to the Laundromat, and an exit north to the Laundromat. I think I've been there. 

Alternatively, maybe I should go back to the Kitchenette and see if there's anything I missed. The Kitchenette had an exit south and west. I went west to the Basement. 

I'm not making progress. Maybe I should try going north from the Vault again. The Vault has exits north, east, and south. I went north to the Basement, east to the Lounge, and south to the Kitchenette. 

Wait, maybe I should go back to the Canteen and check if there's anything there. The Canteen had a plate, but it was empty. 

I'm stuck. I think I need to try a different approach. Maybe I should go back to the Office and see if there's anything else there. The Office had a closed Henderson's limited edition passageway leading west, which I opened. Maybe there's something else in the Office. 

Alternatively, maybe I should go back to the Restroom and check the portal leading north to the Vault again. 

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to go back to the Lounge and see if there's anything else. The Lounge has exits south, west, and east. I've been to all those places. 

Maybe I should try going east to the Canteen again. The Canteen had a plate, but it was empty. 

I'm not finding the target object. Maybe I need to look for containers or supporters where the object might be hidden. Let me check if I have any items in my inventory. I have the Henderson's limited edition key, which I used. 

Wait, maybe the target object is in the Restroom. The Restroom had a shiny counter, a shelf, and a shiny board, all empty. But maybe I can look around more carefully. 

I think I should go back to the Restroom and check if there's anything I missed. So, from the Lounge, I'll go west to the Restroom again.

Okay, so I'm in the Vault now. The goal is to find the target object, which I think is the key or something else. Let me see what I can do here. The observation says there's an open passageway north, an open hatch east, and an open portal south. 

I remember earlier I went through the passageway west into the Restroom, then north into the Vault. Now, I'm back in the Vault. I need to explore all possible exits to find the target. 

I've already gone north from the Vault before, which took me to the Basement. Maybe I should check the other exits this time. The hatch leading east might lead somewhere new. Let me try going east to see what's there. That could be a new room with the target object or another clue.

Okay, so I'm in the Lounge again. Let me try to figure out what to do next. I remember that earlier, I went through several rooms: Canteen, Lounge, Office, Restroom, Vault, Basement, Laundromat, Cookhouse, Kitchenette, and back to Basement and Vault. Now I'm back in the Lounge. 

Looking at the current observation, the Lounge has an open door leading south, an open hatch leading west, and an unblocked entranceway to the east. I need to decide which direction to go. 

I think I've already explored some of these paths before. Let me recap where each direction leads. Going south from the Lounge takes me to the Office, which I've already been to. Going west leads to the Restroom, which I've also visited. Going east might take me somewhere new, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, in the previous steps, I went east from the Lounge to the Office, then south to the Office, and so on. Maybe I should try a different direction this time. Since I've been to the Office and Restroom, perhaps going east is the way to go. 

But wait, the Lounge's east entrance is unblocked, so I can go there without any issues. I'm not sure what's on the other side, but it's worth exploring. Alternatively, maybe I should check if there are any objects or containers in the Lounge that I can interact with. 

Looking back at the observation, it just mentions doors and hatches, no objects mentioned. So, I think the best course of action is to go east to explore a new area. That might lead me closer to the target object or reveal new paths. 

So, I'll choose to go east.

If there's nothing on the plate, perhaps there's something else in the room that I can interact with. Also, there's an exit to the west, so I might need to go that way if I don't find anything here. But first, I should probably look around to see if there's anything useful.

Okay, so I'm in the Lounge, and I need to figure out what to do next. Let me recap where I've been so far. I started in a randomly generated maze, and my goal is to find a specific object. I've been moving through various rooms, unlocking doors, opening passageways, and exploring different areas like the Restroom, Vault, Basement, Laundromat, Cookhouse, Kitchenette, and now back to the Lounge.

In the Lounge, the observation says there's an open door leading south, an open hatch leading west, and an unblocked entranceway to the east. I remember that in the previous steps, I went through several rooms without finding the target object yet. So, I need to decide which direction to go next.

Looking at the available exits: south, west, and east. I've already been to the Vault through the passageway leading north, so going north again might not be necessary unless I missed something there. The Lounge is described as an ordinary place, so maybe the target object isn't here. 

I should consider which direction I haven't explored much. Going west leads to the hatch, which might be a new area. Going east is another unblocked exit, possibly leading to a new room. South leads back to the Kitchenette, which I've already been to. 

Since I want to explore new areas, I'll choose between west and east. The hatch leading west might be a more specific or unique path, so I think going west could be the better option to find the target object.

I started in a randomly generated maze, moved through several rooms like the Restroom, Basement, Laundromat, Cookhouse, Kitchenette, and now I'm back in the Vault. Each time I go through a room, I check for exits and objects. In the Canteen, I saw a plate but it was empty. I didn't find anything useful there.

In the Vault, there are exits leading north, east, and south. I've already been through the east exit to the Lounge and the west exit to the Canteen. Maybe I should explore the north exit this time. It's an open passageway, so I can go there without any issues. I'm hoping that going north might lead me to a new area where I can find the target object or at least get closer to it.

I don't have any items in my inventory right now, so I can't unlock anything. I need to keep moving through the rooms to find clues or the object itself.

Looking at the current observation, the Basement has an open passageway leading south, an unblocked exit to the east, and an entranceway to the north. I've been here before, so I need to decide which direction to go this time. 

I think I should explore each direction systematically to make sure I don't miss anything. I went north earlier, which took me to the Laundromat, but that didn't help. Going east led me to the Kitchenette, and then south from there took me back to the Vault. Maybe I should try going south this time to see what's there.

Okay, so I'm in the Vault again. Let me try to figure out what to do next. I remember that the goal is to find a specific object, but I'm not sure where it is. The Vault has exits leading north, east, and south. I've been here before, so maybe I should explore the other directions this time.

I went north earlier and ended up in the Basement, then to the Laundromat, Cookhouse, Kitchenette, and back. Going east took me to the Lounge and then to the Canteen, but there wasn't anything useful there. Going south from the Vault leads back to the Basement, which I've already explored.

Wait, maybe I should check if there are any containers or objects in the Vault that I missed. The description says it's a well-framed placard, but I don't see any other objects mentioned. So, perhaps I need to go through one of the exits again but in a different order.

Since I've already tried north and east, maybe going south this time could lead somewhere new. Or perhaps I should look around more carefully. But the observation doesn't mention any new objects, so maybe I need to try a different path.

Alternatively, maybe I should go back to the Lounge or Canteen and see if there's something I missed. But I don't have any items in my inventory, so I can't unlock anything yet. I need to find a key or another item that could help me progress.

Wait, the user mentioned that the target object might be in a closed or locked container. So, maybe I need to find a key somewhere. I should keep exploring all possible rooms to find any keys or containers.

Let me try going east again to the Lounge, maybe I missed something there. Or perhaps going south to the Basement again, but I don't remember seeing anything there. Hmm, this is tricky.

I think the best course of action is to go east to the Lounge and then explore further from there. Maybe there's a container or a key hidden somewhere in the Lounge or another connected room.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what to do next in this TextWorld game. Let me recap where I've been so far. I started in the Basement, then went north to the Laundromat, east to the Cookhouse, south to the Kitchenette, west back to the Basement, then south to the Vault. From the Vault, I went east to the Lounge, then east again to the Canteen, and then back west to the Lounge. Now, I'm back in the Lounge again.

Looking at the current observation, the Lounge has an open door leading south, an open hatch leading west, and an unblocked exit to the east. I remember that earlier, when I was in the Canteen, there was a plate but it was empty. I took a look around but didn't find anything useful there. So, maybe I should explore other directions.

I think I've already been west from the Lounge to the Vault, and south might lead me back to the Kitchenette or somewhere else. But the east exit is unblocked, so maybe that's a new area I haven't explored yet. Let me check the available commands again: look, goal, inventory, go <dir>, open, drop, take, put, take from, insert, unlock with.

Since I'm in the Lounge, I should probably look around to see if there's anything useful here. Maybe there's an object I can take or a door I need to unlock. But the observation doesn't mention any objects, just the exits. So, maybe I should move east to explore further.

Wait, but I just came from the Canteen, which was east of the Lounge. So going east again might take me somewhere else. Alternatively, going south might lead to a new room. Let me think about the layout. The Basement is connected to the Laundromat, Cookhouse, and Vault. The Vault has multiple exits, including north, east, and south. I went east from the Vault to the Lounge, then east again to the Canteen, which only had a west exit.

So, from the Lounge, going east again might not be useful since it leads back to the Canteen. Maybe I should try going south from the Lounge. That could lead to a new room that I haven't visited yet. Alternatively, going west back to the Vault might allow me to explore other exits from there, like the portal south.

But I'm not sure if I've explored all possible rooms yet. Let me try to visualize the map. Starting from the Basement, I went north to Laundromat, east to Cookhouse, south to Kitchenette, west back to Basement, south to Vault, east to Lounge, east to Canteen, west back to Lounge. So, the possible exits from the Lounge are south, west, and east. I've been west to Vault and east to Canteen. So, south is the only unexplored direction from the Lounge.

Therefore, I should go south from the Lounge to see what's there. Maybe that's where the target object is located. Alternatively, if that's not the case, I might need to backtrack and explore other areas, but for now, exploring the south seems like the next logical step.

The exits are an open Henderson's limited edition passageway leading east, a closed balsam door leading west, and an open portal leading north.

I came here from the Office via the Henderson's passageway, which is now open. The balsam door is closed, so I can't go west without opening it. The portal to the north leads back to the Vault, I think. 

Since there's nothing to take in the Restroom, maybe I should explore other areas. Going north back to the Vault might not be helpful because I've already been there. The east exit leads back to the Office, which I just came from. The west exit is closed, so I can't go there yet.

Wait, maybe I should check if there's a key somewhere else that can open the balsam door. I remember that keys might be in other rooms or containers. I should probably go back to the Office and see if there's a key there or in any containers. Alternatively, maybe the Lounge or Canteen has something useful.

But before I decide, let me recap the rooms I've visited so far: Basement, Vault, Lounge, Canteen, Office, and now Restroom. I haven't found the target object yet, so I need to keep exploring.

Since the balsam door is closed, I can't go west from the Restroom. So, my options are to go east back to the Office or north to the Vault. Going east might be better because the Office could have a key or another path. Alternatively, maybe the Vault has something I missed.

Wait, in the Vault, I saw a placard and some exits. Maybe there's a container there that I can open with a key. But I don't have a key yet. So, perhaps I should go back to the Office to look for a key.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the Canteen or Lounge. I should consider going back to those rooms. But since I'm in the Restroom, the quickest way back is to go east to the Office, then maybe south to the Lounge or other areas.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible actions. I can go east, north, or west. West is closed, so I can't go there. Going north takes me back to the Vault, which I've already explored. Going east takes me back to the Office, which might have a key or another path.

I think the best course of action is to go east back to the Office to see if there's a key or another exit I can use. Maybe the Office has a container with a key that can open the balsam door in the Restroom.

I need to decide which direction to go. Let me think about where each direction leads. Going west would take me back to the Restroom, which I've already been to. There wasn't much there except a shiny counter, a shelf, and a portal leading north. I don't think I found anything useful there, so maybe I should explore other areas first.

Going north from the Office would take me to the Lounge, I believe. I've been in the Lounge before, and it didn't have anything useful either. It had exits leading south, west, and east. I went east from there to the Canteen, which also didn't have anything. So, maybe the Lounge isn't the best option right now.

That leaves going east. The exit to the east is unblocked, so I can go there without any issues. I'm not sure where that leads, but it's a new area I haven't explored yet. It could potentially have the object I'm looking for or at least give me more clues.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there are any objects in the Office that I can interact with. The description says it's a standard kind of place, but it doesn't mention any visible objects. So, perhaps there's nothing to take or interact with here.

Since there are no visible objects, the best course of action is to explore a new area. Going east seems like the logical choice because it's a new direction and might lead me closer to the target object.

I should also consider if I have any items in my inventory that might be useful. But from what I remember, I haven't picked up anything yet, so I don't have any keys or tools that could help me unlock anything. 

Wait, maybe I should check my inventory. If I have any items, I can use them to unlock doors or containers. But since I don't have any, I need to focus on exploring to find the necessary items.

In summary, I'm in the Office with three exits. Going west and north lead to places I've already been, which didn't yield anything. Going east is a new direction, so I should go there to explore further.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the attic. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

There is a passkey on the floor.",0,False

Okay, so I'm in the attic now. The observation says there's a passkey on the floor. My goal is to find a specific object, which I think is the target object mentioned earlier. Since I'm in the attic and there's a passkey here, I should probably take it because keys are usually important for unlocking things. 

Looking at the available commands, I can use ""take passkey"" to pick it up. That makes sense because the key might be needed to unlock a door or container elsewhere in the maze. I don't see any immediate threats or obstacles here, so taking the key is a safe move. 

I should also consider if there are any other objects or exits I need to check, but the observation only mentions the passkey and an exit to the west. Since I just arrived here, taking the key is the priority. Once I have it, I can explore further or use it when needed. 

So, the best action is to take the passkey.
