0,open locker,"<think>
Okay, so I'm in this TextWorld game, and I need to find a specific object. The current room I'm in is called ""Cubicle."" Let me try to figure out what to do next.

First, the room description says there's a locker and a mantle. The mantle doesn't have anything on it, so maybe the locker is more important. The exit is to the north, so I could go that way, but maybe I should check the locker first.

I remember that in these games, containers like lockers often hold items that are useful, maybe even the target object or a key to unlock something else. So, I should probably try to open the locker. But wait, the locker might be locked. If it is, I might need a key. I don't have any keys yet, so maybe I should look around for one.

But before that, maybe I should just look at the room again to make sure I don't miss anything. The command 'look' will give me a detailed description. Let me try that.

After looking, I still see the locker and the mantle. No other objects mentioned. So, the next step is to try to open the locker. If it's locked, I'll need to find a key. But since I don't have any keys yet, maybe I should go north and explore other rooms to find a key or another container.

Wait, but the exit is unblocked, so I can go north without any issues. Maybe the key is in another room. Alternatively, maybe the target object is in the locker, but I can't get it without a key. So, perhaps I should go north first to see if I can find a key there.

Alternatively, maybe the locker is unlocked, and I can just open it. Let me try that. The command would be 'open locker.' If it's locked, I'll get a message saying it's locked, and then I'll know I need a key.

But since I don't have any keys, maybe I should go north to find one. So, the next action would be to go north.

Wait, but the initial observation didn't mention any other objects except the locker and the mantle. So, maybe the key is in the locker, but I can't open it without a key. That seems a bit circular. Maybe the key is somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the locker is unlocked, and I can just open it. Let me try that. So, I'll use the 'open locker' command.

If the locker is open, I can then look inside to see if there's anything useful. If it's locked, I'll need to find a key, which might be in another room.

So, considering all this, the best first step is to try to open the locker. If it's locked, I'll have to find a key, but if it's open, I might find the target object or another clue.

Wait, but the initial observation didn't mention the locker being locked or not. So, maybe I should just try to open it. If it's locked, I'll know to look for a key elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the target object is in the locker, and I need to unlock it. But without a key, I can't proceed. So, perhaps I should go north to find a key.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The room has a locker and a mantle. The exit is north. I need to find the target object, which might be in a container. So, checking the locker is a good idea.

I'll try to open the locker. If it's locked, I'll have to find a key, which might be in another room. If it's open, I can take any items inside.

So, the action I should take is to open the locker.

1,go north,"<think>
Okay, so I'm in this cubicle, and I need to find the target object. The observation says there's a locker here, and I remember the user tried to open it but was told I need to unlock it with a passkey first. Hmm, so the locker is locked, and I don't have the passkey yet. 

I should think about where the passkey might be. Maybe it's in another room or perhaps in a container somewhere. The observation also mentions a mantle, but there's nothing on it. So, the locker is the main point of interest here. 

Since I can't open the locker without the passkey, I need to find that key. The passkey might be in another room, so I should consider moving north since there's an exit that way. Alternatively, maybe the key is somewhere else in this room, but I don't see any other objects mentioned. 

Wait, the user tried to open the locker, but it's locked. So, the next step is to find the passkey. I should probably go north to explore the next room and see if the passkey is there. Once I have the passkey, I can come back and unlock the locker. 

So, the best course of action is to move north to find the passkey. That way, I can proceed to unlock and open the locker later.

You've entered a cookery.



There is a closed American style passageway leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

2,take spork,"<think>
Okay, so I'm in the Cookery now. Let me see what I can do here. The observation says there's a spork on the floor. I remember the goal is to find a specific object, but I'm not sure what it is yet. Maybe I should check my goal again. Wait, I can use the 'goal' command to remind myself. Let me do that.

Hmm, the goal is to find the target object. I don't know what it is yet, but maybe the spork is related. I should take it just in case. So, I'll take the spork. That way, I have it in my inventory and can use it if needed later.

Also, I need to think about where to go next. There are exits to the north, south, and west. The west exit is a closed American style passageway, which probably means it's a door. I might need a key to unlock it, but I don't have one yet. The north and south exits are unguarded and unblocked, so I can go there without any issues.

I think I'll go north first to explore that area. Maybe there's another clue or a key there. But before I move, I should make sure I have everything I need. Taking the spork is a good idea because it might be useful later on.

So, my plan is to take the spork and then go north to explore further. That should help me progress towards finding the target object.
