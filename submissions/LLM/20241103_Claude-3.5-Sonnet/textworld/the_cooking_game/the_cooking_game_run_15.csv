Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You see a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
