You find yourself in a garden. An usual one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the west.

There is a raw purple potato on the floor.

You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a backyard.

You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You scan the room, seeing a patio chair. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a BBQ. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens.

There is a closed patio door leading north. There is a closed barn door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You arrive in a bathroom. A standard one.

You have moved into the most usual of all possible livingrooms. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a sofa. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed front door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a tomato and a yellow apple. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
