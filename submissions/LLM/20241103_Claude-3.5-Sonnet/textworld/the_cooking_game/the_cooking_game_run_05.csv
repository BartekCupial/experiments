Ah, the backyard. This is some kind of backyard, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty.
