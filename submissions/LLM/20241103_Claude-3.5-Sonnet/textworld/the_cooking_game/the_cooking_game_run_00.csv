If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You're now in a livingroom.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a sofa. The sofa appears to be empty.

There is an open front door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
