Well, here we are in a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty.

There is an open fiberglass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You can see a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh, great. Here's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? On the counter you can make out a red apple, a tomato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
