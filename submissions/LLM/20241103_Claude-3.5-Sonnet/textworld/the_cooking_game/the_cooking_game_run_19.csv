You've just walked into a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see an opened oven nearby. What a letdown! The oven is empty! You can make out a table. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a livingroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a backyard. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You see a patio table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a BBQ.

There is an open barn door leading east. There is an open screen door leading south. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
