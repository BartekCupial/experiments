You've just walked into a backyard. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio chair. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. Silly patio chair, silly, empty, good for nothing patio chair. You make out a BBQ.

There is a closed barn door leading east. There is an open sliding patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see a fridge. You see an oven. You can make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table! oh well. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a yellow apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an open sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
