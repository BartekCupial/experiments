        "Based on the current observation, I'll start by collecting wood from the nearby tree. To do this, I need to move towards the tree and then use the \"Do\" action to collect it.\n\nAction: Move North",
        "Based on the current observation, it seems we have been trying to make a wood sword but haven't succeeded, likely because we don't have a table nearby. Since we have wood in our inventory, let's try to place a table first.\n\nPlace Table",
        "Based on the current observation, it seems we have collected some resources but haven't been able to make a wood sword yet. Since we have wood in our inventory, let's try to make a wood sword again.\n\nMake Wood Sword",
        "Based on the current observation, I see that we have wood in our inventory, which is necessary to make a wood sword. However, we haven't been successful in making the wood sword with our previous attempts. This suggests we might be missing a required element, likely a table nearby to craft on.\n\nGiven this, our next best action should be to place a table, which will allow us to craft items. This action will also help us achieve one of the game achievements.\n\nAction: Place Table",
        "Based on the current observation and inventory, we should focus on gathering more resources and progressing towards our achievements. Let's start by collecting more wood, which we'll need for crafting.\n\nMove South",

        "Based on the current observation, we have some wood in our inventory but not enough to make a wood sword. We also don't have a table nearby to craft items. Let's focus on gathering more resources. The closest resource seems to be the stone to our west.\n\nAction: Move West",
        "Based on the current observation and inventory, I'll change my strategy. We have wood in the inventory, which is necessary to make a Wood Sword. Let's try to craft it now.\n\nMake Wood Sword",

        "Based on the current observation, I think the best action to take is:\n\nMove West\n\nReasoning:\n1. We have low health (2/9), so we should avoid combat for now.\n2. We have some resources in our inventory, but not enough to craft better tools or weapons yet.\n3. Moving west will bring us closer to the stone and path, which might lead to more resources or a safer area.\n4. Moving away from the arrow to the north is a good idea given our low health.",
        "Based on the current observation and inventory, it seems we have the materials to make a Wood Sword, which is one of our achievement goals. Let's try that.\n\nMake Wood Sword",
        "Given the current observation, I'll adjust my strategy:\n\n1. Our health is low, so we need to be cautious.\n2. We have wood in our inventory, which is a key ingredient for many crafting recipes.\n3. We haven't made a wood sword yet, which is one of the achievements.\n\nBased on this, I'll attempt to craft a wood sword:\n\nMake Wood Sword"
