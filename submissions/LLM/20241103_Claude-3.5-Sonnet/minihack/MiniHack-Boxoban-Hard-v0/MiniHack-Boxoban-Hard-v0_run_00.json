        "Based on the current observation, I'll analyze the situation and choose an action:\n\n1. We're in a confined space with boulders and fountains.\n2. Our goal is to push boulders onto fountains.\n3. There are boulders adjacent to us in the north and northeast directions.\n4. There's a fountain very near to the northnortheast.\n\nGiven this information, the best action would be to try to push a boulder onto a fountain. The boulder to the north seems to be in a good position to be pushed towards the fountain.\n\nAction: north\n\nThis action will attempt to push the boulder north, potentially towards the fountain. We'll need to see the result of this action to determine our next move."
