        "Based on the current observation, I think the best action is:\n\nleft\n\nReasoning: We're trying to create a new rule \"KEY IS WIN\" to change the win condition. We've moved the \"IS\" block into position, and now we need to move the \"KEY\" block to the left to complete the rule. This will allow us to win the level by touching the key object instead of needing to reach a different win condition.",

By moving up, we can start to manipulate the \"key is win\" rule, which will allow us to win the level by reaching the key instead of its current win condition.",
