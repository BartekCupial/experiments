        "Based on the current observation, I think the best action is:\n\ndown\n\nReasoning: We're currently positioned next to the 'is' rule block. Moving down will allow us to start manipulating the rules at the bottom of the level, which could be crucial for solving the puzzle. Specifically, we can potentially create new rules like \"door is win\" or \"ball is you\", which might be necessary to complete the level.",
