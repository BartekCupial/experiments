Well, here we are in a bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north.

You find yourself in a pantry. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north.
