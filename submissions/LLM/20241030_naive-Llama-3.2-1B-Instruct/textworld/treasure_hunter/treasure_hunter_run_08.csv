What's that over there? It looks like it's a drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a drawer in a room. What a letdown! The drawer is empty! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.
