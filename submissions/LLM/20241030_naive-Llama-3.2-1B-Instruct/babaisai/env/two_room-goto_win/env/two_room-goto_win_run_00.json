        "To alter the rules, I'll examine the current situation.\n\nI notice that the `wall 1` object is defined as having 3 steps of `down` and 1 step of `up`. This means that if I move a `wall` object 4 steps to the right, it will be blocked by the `up` step, and if I move it 3 steps to the right, it will be blocked by the `down` step.\n\nI also notice that the `rule `wall` 4 step to the right and 3 step up` rule is blocking a `wall` object at position `wall 1`. This means that the `wall 1` object is effectively impassable.\n\nMy goal is to change the rules so that the `wall 1` object is no longer blocked by the `up` and `down` steps.\n\nAction: move the `wall 1` object 4 steps to the right."
