        "I'll start by examining the level carefully to identify potential changes to the rules.\n\nInitially, the rules seem to be trying to convey a sequence of steps (up, right, down) to reach the \"wall\" or \"ball\". I notice that the \"wall\" rule is trying to convey a specific distance (4 steps to the left and 1 step up) that might be useful for finding the ball.\n\nSince I can only move objects or text that are not defined as \"STOP\" or immovable, I'll take a closer look at the rule \"wall\" to see if there's a way to make it more specific. Possible modifications could include changing the \"4 steps to the left\" part to \"4 steps to the right\" or \"4 steps to the left and 1 step down to reach the ball\", or adding an additional \"up\" or \"down\" to reach the ball.\n\nAction: Modify rule `wall` to move the \"4 steps to the left\" and \"1 step up\" parts to \"4 steps to the left and 1 step down\""
