        "Considering the current state of the game, I'd like to examine the rules more closely, especially the \"wall\" rules that seem to be blocking certain paths.\n\nUpon closer inspection, I notice that the \"wall\" rule `wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up` seems to be interfering with the path to the \"win\" rule `win 9 steps to the right and 4 step up`. This might provide an opportunity to create a new rule.\n\nI'd like to try moving the \"wall\" rule to the \"is\" rule, potentially changing the starting point of the \"win\" rule. If successful, I can adjust the rules accordingly.\n\nMy next action is to move the \"wall\" rule to the \"is\" rule:\n\n`is wall 1 step to the left and 3 step up`\n\nNow, I'll move the \"is\" rule to the \"baba is you\" rule:\n\n`baba is you IS is`\n\nNext, I'll examine the new \"is\" rule and consider how I can utilize it to create a new rule or change the existing ones.",
