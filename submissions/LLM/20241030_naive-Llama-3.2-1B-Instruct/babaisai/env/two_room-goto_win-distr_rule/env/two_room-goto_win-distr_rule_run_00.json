        "Given the current observation, I would like to examine the map more closely. \n\nFrom what I can see, I notice that the \"door\" rule is positioned 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but its end position is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. This means that the door is currently 6 steps away from the starting point.\n\nI also see that the \"baba is you\" rule is positioned 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, which doesn't seem to be directly related to the current location.\n\nConsidering the rules and the current observation, my next action would be:\n\nup: move the \"ball\" object 6 steps up",
