        "I'd like to examine the current rules to identify potential changes or manipulations that might help me reach the 'win' object.\n\nAfter examining the current rules, I notice that the 'wall' and 'baba' rules have a specific position (3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, respectively). I also see that the 'is' rule has a specific position (7 steps to the right and 3 steps up).\n\nConsidering these observations, I'd like to try to manipulate the rules to create a new rule that includes the 'baba' object (position: 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down) in the 'is' rule. I'll try to create a new rule by moving the 'is' rule to a different position on the map.\n\nAction: Move the 'is' rule 1 step down.",
