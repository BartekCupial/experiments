        "Since I need to examine the level carefully, I'll take a closer look at the current rules.\n\nI notice that there are multiple rules that can be manipulated. I'm particularly interested in the \"wall\" rules, which seem to be the most restrictive.\n\nI see that the \"wall\" rules have different numbers of steps in different directions, but I'm not sure which rule actually controls which direction. Is the \"wall\" rule controlling the direction of the wall? Could it be that the direction of the wall is controlled by the \"wall\" rule?\n\nI'm not sure if this is the correct direction to take, but I think I might be able to make the wall do something useful. If I can control the direction of the wall, I might be able to create a new rule or change an existing one. Perhaps I can use the \"wall\" rule to create a new rule that controls the direction of the wall.",
