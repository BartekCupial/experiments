I also observe that the wall is currently 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up.\n\nConsidering the goal of reaching the `ball` object, which is defined as a \"win\" object, I think I can manipulate the rules to create a new rule that allows me to move towards the ball. I'd like to try repositioning the wall to create a new rule.\n\nAction: Move the wall 6 steps to the left and 2 steps down.",
