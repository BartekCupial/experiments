        "Considering the current state of the map, I'd like to examine the rules more closely to find a possible solution.\n\nI'll examine the rules that are specific to the wall and the key objects. \n\nThe rule `wall` states that the wall is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. The rule `key` states that the key is 6 steps to the right and 1 step up.\n\nI notice that the wall is 2 steps to the right of the key. I think I can exploit this to my advantage. \n\nI'm going to move the wall 2 steps to the left, which will put it 1 step up, and then move it 1 step to the right, which will put it 2 steps directly above the key.\n\nPlease let me know if this action is valid and if it leads to a solution.",
