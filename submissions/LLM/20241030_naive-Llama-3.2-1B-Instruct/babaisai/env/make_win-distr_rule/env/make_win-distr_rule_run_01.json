        "Considering the available rules and the current state of the game, I'd like to propose the following action:\n\nAction: \"Change rule [baba IS YOU] to change the direction of the 'baba' rule from down to up.\"\n\nThis action would create a new rule by moving the \"baba\" rule from its current position (down) to the right, and change the direction of the \"baba\" rule to up. This could potentially lead to interesting changes in the game, such as:\n\n- The \"baba\" rule now moving up, potentially creating a \"baba IS YOU\" that changes direction, and creating a chain reaction of changes.\n\nPlease let me know if this action is plausible or if I need to come up with something else.",
