        "Since the current state of the game is not applicable or directly relevant to the given rules, I will take a more general approach to the game as well.\n\nGiven that I have no specific information about the game's state regarding other objects or the environment, my primary goal is to identify any potential changes to the existing rules.\n\nOne potential change could be altering the rule `baba IS YOU` to `BABA IS YOU` (or vice versa). However, this might not affect the game's overall flow significantly.\n\nConsidering the current rules and the available actions, my first action will be to examine the current rules to see if any potential changes or combinations can be made.",
