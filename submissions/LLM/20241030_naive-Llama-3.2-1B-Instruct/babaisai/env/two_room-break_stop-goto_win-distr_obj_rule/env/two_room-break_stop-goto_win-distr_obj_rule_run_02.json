I'm looking for any objects or text blocks that could be affected by this rule or others.\n\nSpecifically, I'd like to find any objects or text blocks that are not already defined as \"STOP\" or similar immovable properties. This might help me identify any potential changes or modifications that could be made to the rules.\n\nNext, I'll consider my options and choose a suitable action.",
