Here's an action:\n\nAction: Move the `is` rule 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down.\n\nThis move creates a new location with the following rules:\n\n- `is` is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down\n- `baba` is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down\n- `door` is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down\n\nThis new rule might be useful in further game development.",
