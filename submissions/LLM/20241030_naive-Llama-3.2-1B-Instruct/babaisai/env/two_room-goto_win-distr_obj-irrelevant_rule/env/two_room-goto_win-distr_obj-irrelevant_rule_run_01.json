        "To examine the rules and identify the current rules, I will carefully read and analyze the given information.\n\nFrom the initial observation, I see that there are the following rules:\n\n1. `door` is win\n2. `is` is win\n3. `wall` is win\n4. `baba is you` is win\n\nThese rules seem to define the current state of the game, and I want to change these rules.\n\nI notice that the ball is adjacent to the wall with 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and the `is` rule is in the format `wall is` with 8 steps to the right and 3 steps up. This could potentially be used to create a new rule.\n\nI also see that the key is adjacent to the wall with 7 steps to the right and 1 step down, and the `is` rule is in the format `wall is` with 2 steps up. This could potentially be used to create a new rule.\n\nTo change the rules, I will move the ball, key, and wall to different locations, and see if I can create new rules.\n\nAction: Move the ball 1 step to the right.",
