        "I'll start by examining the rules on the map. I notice that the rules `wall`, `is`, `baba`, and `you` are present. I also see that there are multiple walls on the map, which can be used to change rules.\n\nMy first action is to examine the rule `is` more closely. I see that it defines the following properties: subject, property. I notice that the subject is \"wall\" and the property is \"7 steps to the right and 2 steps up\".\n\nI also notice that the rule `baba` defines the following properties: subject, property. I see that the subject is \"baba\" and the property is \"2 step to the left and 4 steps down\".\n\nConsidering the properties of these rules, I wonder if it would be possible to create a new rule that combines elements of both `is` and `baba`. Perhaps something like `wall IS 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up`, which would be a new property defined by combining the subject and property of the `is` rule.\n\nMy next action is to try this new rule and see if it produces any interesting results.",
