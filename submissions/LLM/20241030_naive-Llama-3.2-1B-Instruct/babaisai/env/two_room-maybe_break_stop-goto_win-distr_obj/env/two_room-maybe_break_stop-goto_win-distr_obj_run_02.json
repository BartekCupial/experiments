        "Given the current state of the game and the rules that need to be changed, I would like to take the following action:\n\nAction: Move the wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down.\n\nThis action combines two existing rules: \"wall is stop\" (1 step to the left and 2 steps up) and \"wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down\". By moving it 2 steps to the right, we can create \"wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down\", which is the goal. This will also affect the rule \"wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up\", as now the wall will be 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down instead of 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up."
