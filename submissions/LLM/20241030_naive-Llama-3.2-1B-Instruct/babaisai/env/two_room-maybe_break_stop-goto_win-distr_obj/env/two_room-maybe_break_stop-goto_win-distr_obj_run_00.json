        "I will start by examining the current state of the map.\n\nI notice that there are multiple rules that can be changed or created. I will look at the rules that are not `wall` or `baba` and consider how I can use them to create new rules.\n\nOne rule that catches my eye is `is` with 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I move the `is` rule to the left, it will change the direction of the win condition. However, this will require adjusting the win rule to compensate.\n\nI also notice that the `baba` rule has a different direction than the `is` rule, but they are adjacent on the map. This could potentially be used to create a new rule that combines the two.\n\nI will try moving the `baba` rule to the left to see if it changes the win condition.\n\nAction: move rule `baba` 2 step to the left",
