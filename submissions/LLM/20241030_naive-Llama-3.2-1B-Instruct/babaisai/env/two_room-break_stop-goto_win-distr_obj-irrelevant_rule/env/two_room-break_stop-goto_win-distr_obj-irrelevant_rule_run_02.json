        "I will start by examining the current rules and objects on the map to identify potential starting points for changing the rules.\n\nI notice that there are a few rules that seem to be in conflict with each other. Specifically:\n\n- The \"wall\" rule (4 steps to the left and 1 step up) seems to be conflicting with the \"wall\" rule (4 step to the left and 1 step up) and the \"wall\" 1 step to the left and 1 step up rule.\n- The \"ball\" rule (2 steps to the right and 1 step down) seems to be conflicting with the \"wall\" rule (4 step to the left and 1 step up) and the \"ball\" rule (2 steps to the right and 1 step down).\n\nConsidering these conflicts, my first action would be to try to change or combine some of these rules to create a new, more balanced rule.",
