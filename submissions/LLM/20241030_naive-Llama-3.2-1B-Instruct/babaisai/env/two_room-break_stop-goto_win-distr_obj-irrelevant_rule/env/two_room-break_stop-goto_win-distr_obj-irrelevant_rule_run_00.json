The ball is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down.\n\nSince the ball is defined as \"STOP\", it cannot be moved. The wall, on the other hand, can be moved. Given the wall's position and the fact that it's only 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, it seems that the wall can be moved up 3 steps to stay at the same level.",
