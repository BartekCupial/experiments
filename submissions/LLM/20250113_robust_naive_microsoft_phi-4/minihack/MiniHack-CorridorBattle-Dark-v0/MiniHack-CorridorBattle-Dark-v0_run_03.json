        "To effectively explore the area and potentially find the stairs down, the best course of action is to avoid repeating moves that lead to walls and focus on unexplored directions. Given the current situation, moving **west** seems promising. This direction is adjacent to a vertical wall but hasn't been explored yet, providing an opportunity to discover new areas or interact with objects.\n\n<|west|>",
