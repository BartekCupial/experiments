        "southwest\n\nBy moving southwest, I can explore a new area and potentially discover paths, items, or enemies that weren't previously visible. This direction was chosen because previous attempts to move north, northeast, and southeast encountered walls, indicating that exploring in the opposite direction might reveal new opportunities. This approach aligns with the goal of thorough exploration to find a way to the stairs down.",
        "southwest\n\nBy moving southwest, I aim to explore new areas that could potentially lead me to the stairs down. Previous movement patterns indicate that this direction might provide access to unexplored paths or items, as previous attempts to move north, northeast, and southeast were blocked by walls. This aligns with the overall goal of exploring efficiently to find a way to progress.",
        "southwest  \n\nBy moving southwest, I can explore a new area that is currently unexplored. The observation indicates that there is a vertical wall adjacent to the southwest, which suggests there might be a doorway or a path to navigate through. This direction also aligns with the goal of discovering the stairs down, as it offers an opportunity to find new passages or items that could be crucial for progress. Additionally, exploring different directions systematically helps avoid circular movements and ensures thorough exploration of the level.",
