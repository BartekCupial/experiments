        "west\n  \nThis action is chosen based on the consistent pattern in the observations that a boulder is adjacent to the west, and attempts to push it have been unsuccessful. The goal is to find a way to overcome the obstacle blocking the path to the boulders. Since the environment hasn't significantly changed, exploring the immediate area to the west might reveal new paths or items that could help in interacting with the boulders or the bars. The choice of \"west\" aligns with the ongoing strategy of navigating towards the boulders and the fountain by exploring adjacent areas, despite previous attempts being blocked by bars. This decision is made with the understanding that the environment's layout and obstacles require a careful approach to find a viable path forward.",
