        "To effectively advance in the game and achieve the \"Collect Wood\" achievement, we need to execute the \"Do\" action when we are standing on the tree, as this is the action used to collect wood in Crafter.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Goal**: Collect wood from the tree located 4 steps to the northwest. This is necessary for crafting essential tools and progressing toward other achievements.\n\n2. **Assess Current Location**: You are currently facing grass, with the tree 4 steps northwest. You also have wood in your inventory, suggesting previous successful wood collection or an initial inventory setup.\n\n3. **Plan Movements**:\n   - **Move West**: The tree is northwest, so we need to move west first.\n   - **Move North**: After moving west, move north to reach the tree's position.\n\n4. **Execute the \"Do\" Action**: Once on the tree, execute the \"Do\" action to collect wood.\n\n5. **Consider Threats**: The zombie is 1 step to the east. While moving northwest, ensure that you do not inadvertently move closer to the zombie. If the zombie approaches, reassess the strategy to avoid it or neutralize it if necessary.\n\n6. **Resource Management**: Keep an eye on food, drink, and energy levels. If they drop too low, consider returning to a safe point to rest or eat.\n\n7. **Progression Strategy**: After collecting wood, plan to craft a wood pickaxe to facilitate further resource collection like stone and coal.\n\nFollowing this plan, the immediate action is to move west.\n\n```\n<Action>Move West</Action>\n<|END|>\n```",
        "To reach the tree and collect wood, you need to move northwest. Since you are currently facing east, you'll need to execute a series of movements to get there.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Move West**: First, move west to start heading towards the northwest direction.\n2. **Move North**: Then, move north to reach the tree's location.\n\nThe immediate action, following this plan, is to move west.\n\n```\n<Action>Move West</Action>\n<|END|>\n```",

        "Given your current status and location, it's crucial to address the immediate threat of your low health and energy while also progressing toward the objective of collecting wood. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis and decision-making process:\n\n### Analysis of Current Situation:\n- **Health & Energy:** Both are critically low, with health at 2/9 and energy at 3/9. This makes survival a priority, especially with a zombie nearby.\n- **Inventory:** You have 7 wood and 5 saplings, which can be used for crafting tools and defenses.\n- **Immediate Threat:** The zombie is 1 step to your east, posing a direct threat that needs to be addressed.\n- **Objective:** Collect wood from the tree to craft essential tools.\n\n### Options and Considerations:\n1. **Move West:**\n   - **Pros:** Moves towards the tree, necessary for collecting wood.\n   - **Cons:** Increases proximity to the zombie and does not address low health and energy.\n\n2. **Move North:**\n   - **Pros:** Moves towards the tree, necessary for collecting wood.\n   - **Cons:** Increases proximity to the zombie and does not address low health and energy.\n\n3. **Do:**\n   - **Pros:** Could potentially damage the zombie if used with a weapon.\n   - **Cons:** You currently lack a weapon, making it ineffective for defense or offense.\n\n4. **Sleep:**\n   - **Pros:** Restores energy, crucial for survival.\n   - **Cons:** Does not address health or the immediate zombie threat.\n\n5. **Craft a Wood Sword:**\n   - **Pros:** Provides a weapon to defend against the zombie and collect wood from the tree.\n   - **Cons:** Requires a table, which is not currently available.\n\n6. **Craft a Wood Pickaxe:**\n   - **Pros:** Necessary for future resource collection.\n   - **Cons:** Requires a table, which is not currently available.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the critical status of health and energy, and the immediate threat posed by the zombie, the priority should be to address survival needs. The best course of action is to **sleep** to restore energy, which is essential for performing other actions effectively. Once energy is restored, you can plan to craft a wood sword to deal with the zombie and then collect wood from the tree.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action to take is **Sleep**. This will help restore energy, allowing you to be more effective in subsequent actions, such as crafting a weapon or moving strategically to collect wood.\n\n```\n<Action>Sleep</Action>\n<|END|>\n```"
