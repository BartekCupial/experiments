        "right\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Current Position and Rules:** You are currently at the position where \"BABA IS YOU\" is active. The goal is to reach the \"WIN\" condition, which is currently 2 steps up from your position.\n\n2. **Map Analysis:** The map shows that moving directly up from your current position is blocked by a \"WALL.\" The immediate surroundings include walls to the left, and the \"WIN\" rule is directly above, but inaccessible due to the wall.\n\n3. **Objective:** To reach the \"WIN\" condition, you need to change the rules or manipulate objects to bypass the wall.\n\n4. **Available Actions:** \n   - Moving right is possible and will bring you closer to other objects, particularly the \"WALL IS STOP\" rule located 10 steps to the left and 1 step up.\n   - Moving up is blocked by a wall, and moving left or down does not contribute to reaching the \"WIN\" condition.\n\n5. **Strategic Move:** \n   - By moving right, you can potentially reach and interact with the \"WALL IS STOP\" rule. Manipulating this rule could allow you to change the properties of walls, enabling you to pass through them or alter the environment to reach the \"WIN\" condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The action \"right\" is chosen to explore the possibility of altering the rules or objects that are currently blocking your path to the \"WIN\" condition. This step is crucial for progressing towards the goal."
