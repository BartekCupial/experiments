        "I'm observing a repeated pattern where I attempt to move \"left\" to change the arrangement of text blocks, particularly to manipulate the \"is\" text block relative to \"baba\" and \"you.\" This might be to alter the active rules. The current setup shows \"baba is you\" and \"wall is stop\" as active rules, with \"baba\" in close proximity to the \"is\" text block.\n\nTo progress, I need to manipulate the \"is\" text block to potentially change the rule configuration. Let's try to pick up the \"is\" text block again, as this could allow me to rearrange it relative to \"baba\" and \"you,\" potentially creating a new rule that might enable movement past walls or towards the \"win\" condition.\n\nThe action I will take is to:\n\n<pickup rule `is`</p>",
