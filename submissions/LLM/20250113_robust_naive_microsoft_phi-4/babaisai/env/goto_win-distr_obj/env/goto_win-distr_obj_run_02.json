        "To progress in the game and potentially unlock new mechanics or pathways, consider the following strategy: \n\n1. **Move the `baba` Rule**: Since \"baba is you\" is an active rule, moving the `baba` rule could temporarily change \"you\" to \"baba.\" This could enable interactions or movements that are otherwise restricted.\n\n2. **Explore the Key**: Since the key is nearby (1 step to the left and 1 step up), consider moving the `baba` rule to \"baba\" to see if it allows you to interact with or move the key. Keys often unlock new paths or alter the game state in a meaningful way.\n\n3. **Experiment with Rule Combinations**: Consider moving the `is` rule to see if you can create new rules like \"baba is key\" or \"key is you,\" which might change how you interact with the environment.\n\n4. **Change Win Conditions**: Attempt to move the `win` rule to see if you can redefine what winning means, potentially allowing you to progress without needing to reach the current win condition.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next logical step is to interact with the nearby key by changing the player to \"baba.\" Here's how you can execute this:\n\n1. Move the `baba` rule to the `baba` object.\n2. Move the `is` rule to the `you` object.\n\nThis will make \"baba is you,\" allowing you to move as \"baba\" and interact with the key. After this, you can try moving the `is` rule to the `key` to see if \"baba is key\" allows for new interactions.\n\nLet's start by executing the first move:\n\n<|ACTION|>left"
