        "To solve this puzzle, I need to change the rules to allow \"BABA\" to reach the \"ball\" and win. Currently, the rules are:\n\n- `ball is win`\n- `wall is stop`\n- `baba is you`\n\nThe walls are blocking my path, and I need to change the rules to make them movable or remove their blocking properties. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Move the 'is' text**: I need to rearrange the text blocks to change the rules. Specifically, I need to move the `is` text to the left to change the rule `wall is stop`.\n\n2. **Change the rule for walls**: By moving the `is` text left, I can create a new rule where `wall is baba` or `wall is you`. This would allow \"BABA\" to move the walls.\n\n3. **Implement the change**: Move the `is` text left to connect with `wall`, and then move `baba` or `you` to connect with `is` and `wall`.\n\nLet's start by moving `is` left:\n\n- **Action**: left\n\nThis action will initiate the rule change process. Once `is` is moved, I can proceed to rearrange the other text blocks to complete the rule change.",
