        "To solve this puzzle in \"Baba Is You,\" you need to create a new rule that allows you to reach the \"door,\" which is the current win condition. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Setup:**\n   - The active rules are \"door is win\" and \"baba is you.\"\n   - You are currently on a \"baba\" block, and the door is 7 steps to the right and 5 steps down from your current position.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - You need to reach the door to win, but currently, you can't move through walls.\n\n3. **Identify Movable Objects:**\n   - The \"wall\" rule is 1 step up from you. This is movable because it doesn't have any restrictions like \"stop.\"\n\n4. **Plan the Rule Change:**\n   - To bypass the walls, you can change the rule so that \"baba\" can move through walls. This can be done by creating a new rule: \"baba is wall.\"\n\n5. **Execute the Plan:**\n   - **Take the 'wall' rule and move it up** so that it overlaps with the \"is\" rule, forming \"baba is wall.\"\n\n6. **Resulting Setup:**\n   - The new rule \"baba is wall\" allows you to move through walls as if you were a wall.\n\n7. **Reach the Door:**\n   - With the new rule in place, move through the walls to reach the door.\n\nHere's the action sequence:\n\n- **Take 'wall' up** to create the rule \"baba is wall.\"\n- Move through the walls to reach the door.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to reach the door and win the level.",
