        "idle\n\n**Analysis of the Current Situation:**\n\n- **Active Rules:** Only one rule is active: \"baba is you.\" This limits the ability to interact with the environment or change conditions.\n- **Object Layout:** The current position is blocked by walls above, and there are obstacles and a ball below. The \"win\" condition is unreachable due to these obstacles.\n- **Available Actions:** Moving in any direction is blocked by walls or the \"stop\" rule.\n\n**Patterns and Changes:**\n\n- **Patterns:** The environment hasn't changed since the initial observation. The walls and rules remain static.\n- **Changes:** No changes have occurred in the environment or rules.\n\n**Potential Past Errors:**\n\n- **Repeated Actions:** The repeated attempts to move up have been ineffective due to the wall.\n- **Rule Manipulation:** There has been no attempt to manipulate rules by moving the text blocks.\n\n**Plan Moving Forward:**\n\n1. **Rule Manipulation:** Since movement is blocked, the next step is to manipulate the rules. The goal is to change the \"baba\" rule to interact with other objects or conditions.\n   \n2. **Focus on Rule Blocks:**\n   - **Move 'baba' and 'is' Together:** Shift the \"baba\" and \"is\" text blocks to create new rules. For example, moving them near the \"ball\" or \"door\" could create new interactions.\n   - **Avoid 'stop' Rule:** Ensure that the movement does not trigger the \"stop\" rule, which is positioned near the bottom.\n\n3. **Action Plan:**\n   - **Move Left:** Start by moving left to position the \"baba\" and \"is\" blocks closer to other rule blocks, enabling new rule creation.\n   - **Evaluate New Rules:** After moving, assess any new rules formed and their potential to alter the environment or win condition.\n\nBy focusing on rule manipulation, the goal is to create a new interaction that allows progress towards the \"win\" condition.",
        "left\n\n**Analysis of Current and Past Environment:**\n\n- **Current Active Rule:** The active rule is \"baba is you,\" which restricts movement and interaction.\n- **Environmental Layout:** The map shows walls, a ball, a door, and text blocks with various rules. The key elements for manipulation are the \"is\" blocks, which can redefine baba's identity.\n- **Obstacles:** There are walls and a \"stop\" rule that prevent movement in certain directions.\n- **Changes and Patterns:** The only change in the environment thus far is my movement to the left, which has not yet resulted in a rule change.\n\n**Available Actions and Potential Changes:**\n\n- **Movement Options:** I can move left, right, up, down, or idle.\n- **Rule Manipulation:** To progress, I need to rearrange the \"is\" blocks to create new rules.\n- **Potential New Interactions:** By moving \"baba\" and \"is\" together, I can potentially transform baba into another object, like \"ball\" or \"door.\"\n\n**Reflection on Past Performance:**\n\n- **Previous Mistakes:** Continued movement without rule changes has been ineffective.\n- **Current Strategy:** Moving left aims to align \"baba\" and \"is\" for potential rule creation.\n\n**Action Justification:**\n\n- **Chosen Action:** Move left.\n- **Reasoning:** This action positions \"baba\" and \"is\" closer, potentially allowing me to create a new rule by moving them together. This could redefine baba's identity, enabling interaction with other objects like the ball or door, which could alter the environment and progress towards the win condition. This approach is strategic, focusing on rule manipulation rather than mere movement.",
