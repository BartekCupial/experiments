The \"key\" is currently one step to the left of my position, so moving right aligns me with it. Once I reach the key, I can pick it up by moving onto its tile, which will make me a \"key\" and allow me to unlock the door. After picking up the key, I can then move down to the door, still following the existing rules, to achieve the win condition.",

After acquiring the key, I will move downward to reach the door, as per the current rule that defines the door as the win condition.",

Once I reach the key, I can pick it up by moving onto its tile, transforming into a \"key\" object. This transformation will allow me to unlock the door and achieve the win condition.
