        "To progress in the game, you need to reach the \"WIN\" condition. Currently, \"baba is you,\" and the \"WIN\" rule is 4 steps up from your current position. However, you're blocked by walls and other rules that prevent movement to the right.\n\nHere's a strategic approach:\n\n1. **Move Up**: Head towards the \"WIN\" rule by moving up.\n\nAction: `up`",
        "To progress towards the \"WIN\" condition, you need to manipulate the rules and objects effectively. Currently, you are blocked by walls, and moving directly up is not possible without altering the rules.\n\nHere's a revised strategy:\n\n1. **Reposition the \"is\" Rule**: Move the \"is\" rule to change your identity or the properties of objects around you. This can potentially allow you to bypass obstacles or change the conditions required to win.\n\n2. **Move the \"is\" Rule**: The \"is\" rule is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up.
