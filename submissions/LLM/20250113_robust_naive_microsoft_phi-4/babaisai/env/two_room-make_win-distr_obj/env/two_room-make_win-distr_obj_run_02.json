        "Take rule \"is\" 1 step to the right and 1 step up. This action aims to rearrange the rules so that \"baba\" becomes \"key\" instead of \"you.\" By doing this, \"baba\" can move to the key, allowing \"you\" to interact with the key directly. This strategic move opens up the possibility of unlocking or changing the level's dynamics, potentially enabling a path to reach the win condition. The key idea here is to leverage the game's rule manipulation mechanics to overcome obstacles, such as walls, by altering the properties of objects or entities within the game world.",
