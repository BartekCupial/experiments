        "To solve the puzzle in \"Baba Is You,\" we need to change the rules so that \"BABA\" can reach the \"WIN\" condition. Currently, the active rules are:\n\n- `baba is you`\n\nThis means that \"BABA\" and \"YOU\" are interchangeable. The \"WIN\" condition requires \"YOU\" to be on the same tile as \"WIN.\"\n\n### Current Position and Obstacles:\n- \"BABA\" is currently in a position where it cannot move right due to \"STOP.\"\n- The \"WIN\" condition is two steps to the right.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The \"STOP\" rule prevents movement in certain directions.\n- The \"door\" is not directly involved in the current obstacle.\n- The \"ball\" is not directly involved in the current path to \"WIN.\"\n\n### Strategy:\nTo reach \"WIN,\" we need to change the rules so that \"BABA\" can bypass \"STOP.\" We can achieve this by creating a new rule that allows \"BABA\" to move freely or by redefining the \"STOP\" rule.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Rearrange Text Blocks:**\n   - Move the \"door\" text block to the \"STOP\" position to create a new rule: `door is stop`.\n   - This effectively removes the \"STOP\" condition from the path to \"WIN.\"\n\n2. **Move Right:**\n   - With \"STOP\" no longer blocking, move right twice to reach \"WIN.\"\n\n### Action Plan:\n1. Move the \"door\" text block to the \"STOP\" position.\n2. Move right twice to reach \"WIN.\"\n\n### Chosen Action:\n- First, move the \"door\" text block to the \"STOP\" position.\n\n<|ACTION|>up",
