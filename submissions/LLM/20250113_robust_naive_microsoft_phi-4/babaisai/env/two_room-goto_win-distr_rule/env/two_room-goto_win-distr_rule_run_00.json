        "To solve the puzzle, we need to reach the door, which is currently 8 steps to the left and 1 step up from the starting position. The key is to rearrange the rules to either make the \"stop\" immovable or allow \"baba\" to pass through it. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Move Right to Reach the Rule \"stop\"**:  \n   - Move right four times to reach the rule `stop`.\n\n2. **Rearrange Rules**:  \n   - Once at the `stop` rule, move up to align with the rule `win`.\n   - Push the `stop` rule up, so it aligns with `win`. This creates a new rule: `stop is win`.\n   - Now, `stop` is no longer an obstacle because it becomes the win condition.\n\n3. **Navigate to the Door**:  \n   - Move left and up to reach the door, which is now accessible.\n\nLet's execute the first step:\n\n**Actions**:\n- right  \n- right  \n- right  \n- right  \n\nNow, I'm at the rule `stop`, ready to rearrange the rules.",

Since the `stop` rule is 8 steps to the left, I should start by moving left.\n\n2. **Navigate Around the Walls**: There are walls at 5 steps to the left and 1 step up, and various other positions. I need to avoid these while moving left.\n\n3. **Rearrange Rules**: Once I reach the `stop` rule, I will move up to align it with `win` and rearrange them to create `stop is win`.\n\n4. **Reach the Door**: With `stop` as the win condition, I can move to the door without being stopped.\n\n**Immediate Action**:\n\n- Move left to start navigating towards the `stop` rule.\n\n**Action**:\n\n- left"
