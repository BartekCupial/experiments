Here's the plan:

1. **Change the ""stop"" rule**: We want to remove the restriction of ""stop"" to allow BABA to move freely. To do this, we need to manipulate the rules:
   - Move the ""is"" text to combine with ""baba"" to make ""baba is key.""
   - Then, move the ""key"" text to combine with ""door"" to make ""door is key.""

2. **Reach the door**: With ""baba is key"" and ""door is key,"" BABA can interact with the door, which is currently a win condition.

Let's execute these steps:

1. Move ""is"" to the left to combine with ""baba"":
   - `left`

2. Move ""key"" to the right to combine with ""door"":
   - `right`

3. Move ""key"" down to combine with ""door"":

4. Move ""key"" down again to finalize ""door is key"":

27,"To solve the puzzle, we need to change the rules so that BABA can interact with the door. The current active rules are `door is win` and `baba is you`, and the path is blocked by `wall` and `stop`. Here’s the plan:

1. **Change the ""stop"" rule**: We need to remove the restriction of ""stop"" to allow BABA to move freely. This requires manipulating the rules:
   - Move the ""is"" text to combine with ""baba"" to make ""baba is key.""
   - Then, move the ""key"" text to combine with ""door"" to make ""door is key.""

2. **Reach the door**: With ""baba is key"" and ""door is key,"" BABA can interact with the door, which is currently a win condition.

Let's execute these steps:

1. Move ""is"" to the left to combine with ""baba"":
   - Action: `left`

2. Move ""key"" to the right to combine with ""door"":
   - Action: `right`

3. Move ""key"" down to combine with ""door"":

4. Move ""key"" down again to finalize ""door is key"":
