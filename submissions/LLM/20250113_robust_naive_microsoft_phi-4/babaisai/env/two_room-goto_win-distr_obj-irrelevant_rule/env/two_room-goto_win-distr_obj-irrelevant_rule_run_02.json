        "To solve the puzzle, we need to change the rules so that BABA can reach the \"door\" and win. Currently, \"door is win\" is the active rule, and BABA is stuck because the path is blocked by \"wall\" and \"stop.\"\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Change the \"stop\" rule**: We want to remove the restriction of \"stop\" to allow BABA to move freely. To do this, we need to manipulate the rules:\n   - Move the \"is\" text to combine with \"baba\" to make \"baba is key.\"\n   - Then, move the \"key\" text to combine with \"door\" to make \"door is key.\"\n\n2. **Reach the door**: With \"baba is key\" and \"door is key,\" BABA can interact with the door, which is currently a win condition.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n1. Move \"is\" to the left to combine with \"baba\":\n   - `left`\n\n2. Move \"key\" to the right to combine with \"door\":\n   - `right`\n\n3.
