The immediate goal is to move the `win` rule closer to Baba, allowing Baba to win by reaching it.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the `win` rule closer to Baba by moving it to the right.\n2. Ensure that no `wall` blocks the path.\n\nCurrent position of `win`: 6 steps to the right and 1 step up.\nCurrent position of Baba: 1 step to the right.\n\nTo achieve this, let's move the `win` rule one step to the right.\n\n**Action:**\n\nright"
