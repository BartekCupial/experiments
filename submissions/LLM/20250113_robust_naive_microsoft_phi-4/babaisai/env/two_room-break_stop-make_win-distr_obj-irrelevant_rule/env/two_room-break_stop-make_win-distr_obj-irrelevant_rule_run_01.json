        "Collect the text block `is` located 5 steps down from Baba. This action allows you to manipulate the rules by placing the `is` text block adjacent to `baba`. \n\nAfter collecting `is`, place it next to `baba` to change the rule to `baba is is`. This effectively makes `baba` the same as whatever `is` is currently assigned to. \n\nIn the current map, `is` is associated with `you`, so `baba is is` results in `baba is you`. This does not initially change the game state, but it sets up for further manipulation.\n\nNext, move the `is` text block to the `key` rule, making the new rule `key is is`. Since `is` is `you`, this changes the rule to `key is you`, allowing `baba` to interact with the `key` as if it were `you`.\n\nNow, move `baba` to the `key`. Since `key is you`, `baba` can now pick up the `key`.\n\nWith the `key` picked up, move the `is` text block to the `door` rule, creating `door is is`. This changes the rule to `door is you`, allowing `baba` to open the `door`.\n\nFinally, move `baba` to the `door` to open it, using the `key` to unlock it if necessary. This should clear the path to the `win` condition, allowing you to complete the level. \n\nChosen action: take `is` 5 steps down.",

        "You're currently in a position where interacting with the `is` text block could alter the rules of the game. The text blocks you can interact with are `is`, `baba`, and `you`. \n\nHere's a strategic plan:\n\n1. **Objective**: Change the rules to progress in the game.\n2. **Current Rule**: `baba is you` restricts you from moving because of walls and stop blocks.\n3. **Potential Strategy**:\n   - **Change Baba's Identity**: You can swap the `is` text block with either `baba` or `you` to change what \"BABA\" represents. This could potentially allow you to move as an object that isn't blocked by walls or stop blocks.\n\nLet's attempt to make Baba into an object that can move freely, like a ball:\n\n- Move the `is` text block to the `ball`. This changes the rule to `baba is ball`, allowing Baba to roll over walls and stop blocks.\n\n**Action**: Take `is` 6 step to the right and 2 step down.",
