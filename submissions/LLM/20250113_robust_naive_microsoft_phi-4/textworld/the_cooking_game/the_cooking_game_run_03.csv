You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
