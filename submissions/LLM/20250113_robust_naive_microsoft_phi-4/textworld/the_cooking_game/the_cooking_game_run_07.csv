You find yourself in a pantry. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north.
