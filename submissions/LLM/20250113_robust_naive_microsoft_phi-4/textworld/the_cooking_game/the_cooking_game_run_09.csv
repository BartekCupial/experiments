You have come into a livingroom. Not the livingroom you'd expect. No, this is a livingroom.

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed fiberglass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
