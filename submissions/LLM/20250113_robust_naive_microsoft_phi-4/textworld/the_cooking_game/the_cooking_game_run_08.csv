Ah, the backyard. This is some kind of backyard, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table! oh well. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a BBQ.

Ah, the backyard. This is some kind of backyard, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table! oh well. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a BBQ. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens.

There is an open wooden door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You've walked into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the shed.

You can make out an opened toolbox right there by you. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. You shudder, but continue examining the workbench. The workbench is wooden. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the workbench.

There is an open wooden door leading south.
