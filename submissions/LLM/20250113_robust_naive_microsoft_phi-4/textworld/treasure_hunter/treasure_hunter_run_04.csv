There is an unblocked exit to the north.",0,False
1,"take mantle

This action is chosen because the mantle is a visible object within the cubicle. By taking the mantle, I may discover if it conceals any hidden items or clues. Additionally, it's crucial to use every opportunity to interact with objects in the environment, as they might be essential for solving puzzles or accessing new areas. Taking the mantle is a direct and simple action that aligns with the goal of exploring and gathering useful items.",,That's not a verb I recognise.,0,False
2,"take mantle from cubicle  

This action is explicitly focused on taking the mantle from the cubicle, using the correct verb structure required by the game. By specifying ""from cubicle,"" I ensure the game correctly recognizes the command, addressing the initial error of an unrecognized verb. This action remains aligned with the strategy of collecting potentially useful objects in the environment.",,That's not a verb I recognise.,0,False

This aligns with the strategy of thorough exploration and interaction with the environment.",,You can't see any such thing.,0,False

This action is chosen because the spork is visible and within reach in the cookery.

This aligns with the strategy of gathering all potentially useful items to increase the chances of overcoming obstacles and achieving the game's objectives.",,You can't see any such thing.,0,False
