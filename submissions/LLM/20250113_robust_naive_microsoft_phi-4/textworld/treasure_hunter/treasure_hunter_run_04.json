Additionally, it's crucial to use every opportunity to interact with objects in the environment, as they might be essential for solving puzzles or accessing new areas. Taking the mantle is a direct and simple action that aligns with the goal of exploring and gathering useful items.": 1,
        "take mantle from cubicle  \n\nThis action is explicitly focused on taking the mantle from the cubicle, using the correct verb structure required by the game.
