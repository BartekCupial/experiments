Well, here we are in a bedroom. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
