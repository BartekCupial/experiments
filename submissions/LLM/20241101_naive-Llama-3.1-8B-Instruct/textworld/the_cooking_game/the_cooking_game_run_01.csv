You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a fridge. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. On the counter you make out a red apple, a tomato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
