To reach the door, we need to move it downward. \n\nSince the rule \"baba is you\" is active, moving the \"baba\" object (which is us) downward should also change the property of the baba object. The rule \"baba is you\" will be affected and we will be able to move the \"baba is you\" rule.\n\nAction: down",
