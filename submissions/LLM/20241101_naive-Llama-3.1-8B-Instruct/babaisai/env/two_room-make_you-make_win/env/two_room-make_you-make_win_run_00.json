        "Based on the current observation, it appears that the goal is to reach the \"rule `win`\" object. To do this, we need to find a way to reach the position where the \"rule `win`\" object is located (7 steps to the right and 4 steps up). \n\nHowever, we cannot directly move to this position because of the wall objects in the way. \n\nLet's try to change the rules to make it possible to move through the walls or to change the position of the key object that might be necessary to unlock the \"rule `win`\" object. \n\nFirst, let's try to change the rule \"wall is stop\" to see if we can make the walls movable.
