        "From your observation, it seems like you need to reach the \"door\" to win. However, the rules currently restrict you from moving towards it. \n\nNotice that the rule \"baba is you\" is active, and the rules defining \"baba\" and \"you\" are quite similar to the movements of the door. This could be the key to solving the puzzle.\n\nI'll try to manipulate the rules to make myself closer to the door by moving the \"baba\" rule. \n\nAction: left",
