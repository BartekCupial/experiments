Let's see. The goal is usually to get to the WIN object, which in this case is the door. So the active rules are door is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. That means I'm Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall. The door is the target.

Looking at the objects on the map, the door is quite far to the right. There's a wall blocking the path directly to the door. The walls are 4 steps to the right in various positions. There's also a key mentioned, but I don't see it on the initial list. Wait, the rule 'key' is 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But the objects listed include a ball at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant yet.

Since I'm Baba and can move (because baba is you), I need to figure out how to get past the walls. The walls are stop, so I can't move into them. But maybe I can change the rules to make the walls not stop. For example, if I can make wall be something else, like 'push' or 'you', then I could move through them. But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules.

The existing rules are door is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. These are text blocks on the map. The rules are located at specific positions. For instance, the 'door' rule is 7 steps right and 2 up, 'is' is 8 right and 2 up, 'win' is 9 right and 2 up. Similarly, there's a 'wall' rule at 1 left and 1 up, another 'is' at 1 up, 'stop' at 1 right and 1 up. So the original rule ""wall is stop"" is made up of those three blocks.

To change the wall's property, I need to either move the 'stop' block or replace it with another property. But I can only move objects that aren't stop. Since walls are stop, I can't move them. However, the text blocks that make up the rules might be movable if they aren't part of a stop rule. Let me check which text blocks are movable.

The 'door', 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'baba', and 'you' rules are all text blocks. The 'wall' is stop, so the individual text blocks that form ""wall is stop"" (wall, is, stop) might be stop themselves? Wait, no. The rule ""wall is stop"" applies to the wall object. So the wall object is stop, but the text blocks themselves (the words 'wall', 'is', 'stop') are separate objects. Wait, in Baba Is You, the text blocks that make up a rule are movable unless the rule defines them as stop. For example, if a rule says ""text is stop"", then those text blocks can't be moved. But in this case, the rules are ""door is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"".

So the text blocks for 'door', 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'baba', 'you' are all separate. The 'wall' object is stop, but the text blocks that form the ""wall is stop"" rule (wall, is, stop) might not be stop unless specified. So maybe I can move those text blocks.

The goal is to either make the wall not stop, or make myself able to go through stop objects. Alternatively, make the door something else, but door is win. Wait, the active rule is door is win, so the door is the win condition. So I need to reach the door. But the path is blocked by walls.

Looking at the positions of the rules: the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up, 1 up, and 1 right and 1 up. So those three blocks are forming the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the 'stop' block from that rule, then the rule would become ""wall is"", which is invalid, so the original rule would be removed. That would make walls not stop anymore. Then I could walk through them.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes me able to pass through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"" or ""baba is move"", but I need to have the text blocks for that. However, the available text blocks on the map include 'baba', 'is', 'you', 'win', 'door', 'stop', 'wall', and 'key' rule. The 'key' rule is at 5 right 2 down. But how do I get there?

Wait, let's map out the positions more clearly. The player (Baba) is probably at a starting position, but the current observation doesn't mention Baba's position. Hmm, the problem is that without knowing where Baba is located on the map, it's hard to plan the exact path. But maybe the objects listed include where Baba is. Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'baba' at 1 left and 4 down, 'is' at 4 down, 'you' at 1 right and 4 down. So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed by those three blocks. That makes sense.

But where is Baba's actual avatar? The objects listed include ""wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up"", etc., but not Baba. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player's character (Baba) is an object on the map, and the rule ""baba is you"" allows them to control that object. So assuming that the Baba avatar is somewhere on the map, perhaps near the ""baba is you"" rule. But without knowing the exact positions, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the key at 5 right 2 down is relevant. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock something. But how? The door is the win condition, but maybe there's a rule that requires a key to open the door. However, the current active rules don't mention a key. So perhaps the key is a red herring, or maybe I need to create a rule that links the key to opening the door.

But first, the immediate problem is the walls blocking the path to the door. Let's focus on manipulating the ""wall is stop"" rule. The 'stop' block in that rule is at 1 step right and 1 up. If I can move that 'stop' block, then the rule would become ""wall is"", which is invalid, so the wall would no longer be stop. Then I could walk through the walls.

To move the 'stop' block, I need to be able to move it. Since the 'stop' block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but the rule itself makes walls stop. However, the text blocks (stop) themselves are not necessarily stop unless the rule says so. Wait, in Baba Is You, the properties are applied to the objects, not the text blocks. So the 'stop' text block is just a tile; unless there's a rule that says ""text is stop"", the text block can be moved. In this case, the only stop rule is ""wall is stop"", which affects the wall object, not the text blocks. Therefore, the 'stop' text block at 1 right and 1 up can be moved.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to navigate to its position and move it. The 'stop' block is at 1 right and 1 up. So from wherever I am, I need to move right and up to get there. But I don't know my current position. Let's assume that the rules are arranged on the map, and the player (Baba) is near the ""baba is you"" rule. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left and 4 down, 'is' at 4 down, 'you' at 1 right and 4 down. So perhaps the player is near there. If I move down to reach those rules, but maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, the door is 7 steps right and 2 up from the 'door' rule. Wait, the 'door' rule is at 7 right and 2 up. So the door object is probably at that position? Or is the rule located there, and the door is elsewhere? In Baba Is You, the text blocks that form a rule are separate from the objects they describe. So the door object is a separate entity, and the rule 'door' is a text block that, when combined with 'is' and 'win', makes the door a win condition.

This is getting a bit confusing without seeing the map layout. Let me try to reconstruct possible positions.

Assuming that the player (Baba) is near the ""baba is you"" rule, which is at 1 left 4 down, 4 down, and 1 right 4 down. So those three blocks form the ""baba is you"" rule. Let's say the player is at the position of the 'baba' text block, which is 1 left and 4 down. From there, moving right would bring them to the 'is' block, then right again to the 'you' block. But that area might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, the player could be elsewhere. Since the walls are 4 steps to the right in various positions, perhaps the map is arranged with a long corridor to the right, blocked by walls, and the door is at the end. The key is at 5 right 2 down, which might be below the main path.

But to proceed, I need to focus on the immediate actionable steps. The key actions are moving the 'stop' block to remove the wall's stop property. To do that, I need to reach the 'stop' block at 1 right and 1 up. From the player's position (assuming they're near the bottom left where the 'baba is you' rule is), moving right and up might be the way.

But how to get there? Let's think about the movement. Suppose the player is at position (0,0). The 'baba' rule is at (-1, -4), 'is' at (0, -4), 'you' at (1, -4). The 'stop' block is at (1, 1). To get there, the player would need to move right (from 0 to 1) and up four steps. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the objects: there are walls at 4 steps right in various positions. For example, wall 4 right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, etc. So if the player is starting near the bottom left, moving right towards the 'stop' block at (1,1) might be possible without hitting walls. But if there are walls blocking the path, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move up first. If the player moves up from their starting position, they might avoid the walls. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say.

Another approach: instead of removing the 'stop' from the wall rule, create a new rule that allows Baba to pass through walls. For example, ""baba is push"" or ""baba is move"". To do this, the player would need to move the 'baba', 'is', and appropriate property (like 'push') text blocks together. However, the available text blocks include 'baba', 'is', 'you', 'win', 'door', 'stop', 'wall', and 'key'. So 'push' isn't present, but maybe 'move' isn't either. Unless the key is involved, but the key's rule is at 5 right 2 down.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"", which would make the player win upon touching anything, but that's probably not helpful here. Or make ""baba is key"", but that doesn't help with moving through walls.

Alternatively, change the door's rule to something else. But the door is win, so if we make door be something else, the win condition changes. But the goal is usually to reach the door, so that's counterproductive unless there's another win object.

Wait, the current active rules are door is win, so the win condition is the door. The ball at 5 right 3 down is probably not a win unless a rule changes that. But there's no rule stating ball is win.

Back to the main problem: walls are stop. Need to get past them. So either remove the stop property from walls or make Baba able to ignore stop.

The most straightforward way is to remove the 'stop' from the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, move the 'stop' text block. The 'stop' block is at 1 right and 1 up. So from wherever the player is, the path to (1,1) needs to be cleared.

Assuming the player is near the bottom left (where the 'baba is you' rule is), moving right once and up four times would reach the 'stop' block. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 right 2 up, 4 right 1 up, etc. So the path to (1,1) is likely not blocked by walls. The walls are further to the right. So moving right once and up four steps should be possible.

Therefore, the action would be to move right and then up, but since each action is a single step, the player needs to sequence the moves. However, the problem requires choosing exactly one action. So the first step is to move right to get to x=1, same y. Then move up once to y=1. But the question is, what's the immediate action to take?

Wait, the current observation doesn't specify the player's position. This is a problem. Without knowing where the player is located on the map, it's impossible to determine the exact movement needed. The objects listed are the walls, rules, and other items, but the player's position isn't mentioned. This is a flaw in the problem statement.

Assuming that the player is at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 1 left and 4 down, then to reach the 'stop' block at 1 right and 1 up, the player would need to move right twice (from -1 to 0 to 1 in x-coordinate) and up five times (from -4 to -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 in y-coordinate). But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different position. Since the problem provides the positions of all objects but not the player, it's challenging. However, in typical Baba Is You levels, the player starts near the ""baba is you"" rule. So perhaps the player is adjacent to those text blocks.

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to focus on manipulating the 'stop' block. To do that, the player needs to move right and up. The first step would be to move right towards the 'stop' block. So the chosen action would be 'right'.

But wait, the player might be blocked by other objects. For example, if moving right from their current position would take them into a wall. But the walls are 4 steps to the right, so if the player is near the left side, moving right shouldn't hit a wall immediately.

Alternatively, the player could be at a position where moving up is necessary first. Without knowing, it's hard to say. But given the available information, the most logical first step is to move right towards the 'stop' block's x-coordinate.

Therefore, the chosen action is to move right.

Let's see. The user is playing Baba Is You and needs to figure out the next move. I'll start by understanding the current state based on the observation provided.

First, the active rules are door is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. That means if Baba touches a wall, he stops (can't move through it), and the goal is to reach the door. But maybe those rules can be changed by moving text blocks around.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The ball is nearby, but not sure if that's relevant. The rules related to key might be there to interact with. The walls are mostly to the right, so movement might be restricted there. 

The player is likely Baba, since ""baba is you"" is a rule. The goal is the door, which is currently set as win. But maybe the solution involves changing the win condition or making Baba have other properties.

The key could be important. If I can pick up the key, maybe it can be used to unlock something. But how? In Baba Is You, sometimes objects can be pushed if they're not stopped. Since wall is stop, maybe the key can be moved. Let's check where the key is located. It's 4 steps right and 2 down from the player's current position. Wait, in the initial observation after moving right, the key is now at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So if the player is at position (assuming starting point), moving down twice and right four times would reach the key. But how to move there without hitting walls?

Looking at the walls: There's a wall 4 steps right (directly right from the player?), and walls at 3 steps right in various directions. The path to the key might be blocked. Let me visualize the grid. Suppose the player is at position (0,0). After moving right once, they are at (1,0). The key is at (4, -2) maybe? Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the object positions relative to the player's current position.

The objects are described relative to the player's current position. For example, wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up would be at (4, 2). After moving right, the player is now at a new position, and the objects are adjusted accordingly. So the key is now 4 steps right and 2 steps down from the player. So to reach the key, the player needs to move right three more times (from their current position, which was originally at 1 step right after the first move) and down two times. But are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the current objects after moving right:

- Wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up (player is at 3 right, 0 up? Or maybe the coordinates are different. This part is a bit unclear. Let me think again.)

Alternatively, maybe the player's position has changed, and the objects are listed relative to the new position. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. So to get there, the player needs to go right 4 steps and down 2. But are there walls in between?

Looking at the walls listed: wall 3 steps right, wall 3 right and 1 down, 2 down, 3 down, 4 down. So the path right to 3 steps is clear, but to go further right to 4, there's a wall at 4 steps right (wall 4 steps to the right). Wait, in the current observation, after moving right, the walls are at 3 steps right, and 3 right with various down steps. So maybe the player is at 3 steps right now, and the key is at 4 right, 2 down. But between the player (3 right) and the key (4 right), there's a wall at 4 steps right. So the player can't go directly right past that wall. Unless they can move the wall rule.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop. So any text blocks that say ""wall"" are creating the stop property. The rule ""wall is stop"" is present. If the player can move the ""wall"" text block, they could change what is a wall. For example, if they can make ""key is stop"" or something else, but that's probably not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to get the key to combine it with other rules. If the key is an object, perhaps ""key is push"" or ""key is you"" could be made. But to do that, the player needs to interact with the key and the text blocks.

Alternatively, the door is the win condition. But the player is blocked by walls. Maybe they need to change the ""door is win"" rule to something else. For example, if they can make ""baba is win"", then just reaching Baba (themselves) would win. But how?

The current rules are door is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The player is Baba, so if they can change ""door is win"" to ""baba is win"", then just moving around as Baba would be enough. To do that, they need to move the ""door is win"" text blocks. The rule ""door"" is at 6 right, 2 up; ""is"" at 7 right, 2 up; ""win"" at 8 right, 2 up. So the entire rule ""door is win"" is three text blocks forming that rule. To break the rule, the player needs to move one of those blocks away. But since the player is Baba (you), they can move objects unless they are stopped. The walls are stop, so if the player can get past the walls to reach those text blocks.

The path to the ""door is win"" text blocks: the player is currently at position (3 right, 0 up?), and the rule is at 6 right, 2 up. So the player needs to move right 3 times and up 2 times. But between them and the rule, are there walls?

Looking at the walls in the current observation:

- Wall at 3 steps right and 2 up (from player's position). So that's directly in the path. So the player can't go straight right and up because there's a wall there. So they need to find another way around.

Alternatively, maybe the player can push the wall? But wall is stop, so unless the player has a property that allows moving stop objects, they can't. The active rules are wall is stop, so the player (being Baba) can't push walls unless they change the rule.

Another approach: The key is at 4 right, 2 down. If the player can get the key and then use it to interact with other objects. For example, if ""key is you"", then the player becomes the key. But how to make that rule?

To create ""key is you"", the player needs to have the ""key"" text block and the ""you"" text block next to each other. The ""you"" rule is currently at 4 steps down. So if the player can move the ""you"" block to be near the ""key"" block, they can form the new rule.

But the player needs to reach the key first. To get to the key at 4 right, 2 down, considering the walls:

From the player's current position (after moving right once), the path to the key is right to 4, down to 2. But there's a wall at 4 steps right (directly right from player's position?), so the player can't go past that. Wait, in the current observation, the walls are listed as:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up

- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up

- wall 3 steps to the right

- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down

- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down

- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down

So the player is at 3 steps right (after moving right once initially). The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. But between the player's position (3 right) and the key (4 right), there's a wall at 4 steps right. So the player can't move directly right to 4 because of that wall. They need to find a way around.

Maybe the player can move down first to avoid the wall. For example, move down past the walls. Let's see: the player is at 3 right. If they move down, they can go to 3 right and 1 down (which is a wall), then 3 right and 2 down (another wall), etc. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, go up around the wall at 3 right and 2 up. The wall is at 3 right, 2 up. The ""door is win"" rule is at 6 right, 2 up. So if the player goes up two steps from their current position (3 right, 0 up?), reaching 3 right, 2 up, but there's a wall there. So they can't go up there.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the solution is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. If the player can make ""wall is nothing"" or ""wall is push"", then they can move through walls. To do that, they need to manipulate the existing rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". If the player can move the ""stop"" block to a different position, they could change the rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So the rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by the text blocks at positions relative to each other. If the player can move the ""stop"" block away, they can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, and the player could move through them.

To move the ""stop"" block, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up from the player's current position. So if the player moves up once, they can push the ""stop"" block (assuming they can move it since it's not stopped unless the rule says so). Wait, but ""wall is stop"" is the active rule, but ""stop"" here is part of the rule, not an object with the stop property. Wait, no. The ""stop"" text block is part of the rule ""wall is stop"". So the actual stop property is on the wall. The ""stop"" text block is just a component of the rule. So moving the ""stop"" text block would disrupt the rule, making walls not stop anymore.

So if the player can move the ""stop"" text block (which is at 1 step up), they can do that. To move it, they need to be next to it and move it in a direction. The player is at 3 steps right. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step up. So the player is three steps to the right of the ""stop"" block. They need to move left to get to the ""stop"" block's position.

Wait, the player's current position after the first move is such that the ""stop"" block is 1 step up. So the player is at, say, position (3,0), and the ""stop"" block is at (3,1). So to reach it, the player needs to move up once. But moving up would take them to (3,1), where the ""stop"" block is. Then, can they move the ""stop"" block? Since the player is Baba (you), they can move objects unless they are stopped. The ""stop"" block is part of a rule, but it's just a text block. Text blocks can be moved unless they are part of a rule that makes them stop. But in this case, the rule is ""wall is stop"", which refers to the wall objects, not the text blocks. So the text blocks themselves can be moved as long as they aren't stopped by another rule. Since there's no rule saying ""text is stop"", the player can pick up the ""stop"" block and move it.

So the plan could be: move up to the ""stop"" block, then move it somewhere else to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls are no longer stop, and the player can walk through them. Once that's done, they can navigate to the ""door is win"" text blocks and change them to ""baba is win"", making the player win by touching themselves.

Alternatively, after removing ""wall is stop"", the player can go around the walls to reach the ""door is win"" text blocks. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move up to the ""stop"" block (1 step up from player's current position).
2. Move the ""stop"" block to a different location, say, to the right or left, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so the player can move through them.
4. Navigate to the ""door is win"" text blocks (at 6 right, 2 up) and rearrange them to ""baba is win"".
5. Then, simply move around as Baba to win.

But this requires several moves. The immediate next action would be to move up to the ""stop"" block.

In the current observation, after moving right once, the player's position has the ""stop"" block at 1 step up. So the player needs to move up once to reach it. Then, they can push it, say, to the right, making the rule ""wall is sto"" (incomplete) or moved apart.

So the first action should be to move up.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So normally, I need to get to the door to win. But looking at the objects on the map, the door is 8 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the way. The wall is defined as ""stop"", which means I can't pass through them. So how can I get past the walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""stop"" 1 step up. Wait, that's probably a text block that says ""STOP"". If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can turn off the stop property of the walls. But how? To move a text block, I have to be either the same as ""baba is you"" or if the text block is not stopped. Since the walls are stop, but the text blocks might not be. The rule ""stop"" is 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then maybe the walls won't be stop anymore. But how do I get to it?

Let me check the current position. The player is Baba, right? So ""baba is you"" means I can move. The objects around: there's a ""stop"" rule 1 step up. To get there, I need to move up once. But is there anything blocking? Let me look. There's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I'm currently at the starting position, which is probably 3 steps to the right (since the walls are 3 steps right in various positions), moving up would take me to that wall. But the wall is stop, so I can't move through it. Wait, but if I can move the ""stop"" rule first, maybe the wall isn't stop anymore. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. There's a ""key"" at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Do I need to get the key? But the active rules don't mention key being anything. If I can pick up the key by moving to it, but since key isn't a property yet, maybe that's not useful. Unless I can create a new rule like ""key is push"" or something. But I don't know if that helps yet.

Wait, the ""door is win"" means that reaching the door makes me win. But the door is blocked by walls. The walls are stop, so I can't move through them. So changing the ""stop"" property of the walls would be necessary. The ""stop"" rule is a text block, so if I can move that text block away, the walls would no longer be stop. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to somewhere else, like next to a wall, then maybe the wall's property changes. Wait, no. The rules are defined by the text blocks. Each text block like ""wall is stop"" creates the rule. If I remove the ""stop"" text block, then the wall's stop property is gone.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule away. To do that, I need to be able to move. Currently, I'm Baba, so I can move. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move up, but there's a wall in the way. Wait, the wall is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Let me visualize the map. Suppose the player is at position (3,0). Then the wall at (3,1) is blocking the path up. The ""stop"" rule is at (x,1), where x is 1 step up from where? Maybe the player is at (3,0), and the ""stop"" rule is at (3,1). But the wall is also at (3,1). So moving up from (3,0) to (3,1) would hit the wall, which is stop, so I can't move there.

Hmm, this is a problem. So how to get to the ""stop"" rule? Maybe I need to rearrange other text blocks to make a path. Let's look at the other text blocks. There's a ""door"" rule at (6,1), ""is"" at (7,1), ""win"" at (8,1). Those are probably forming the rule ""door IS WIN"", but the active rule is ""door is win"", so maybe that's already parsed correctly. Then the ""wall"" rule is at (2,0) (2 steps left) and ""is"" at (1,0). So the rule ""wall IS STOP"" is created by those. So the wall's stop property comes from that text block.

If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how? To move the text blocks, I need to be able to move them, which requires that they are not stopped. The ""wall"" text blocks are part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but once the rule is active, the walls are stop. However, the text blocks themselves might not be stop unless specified. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" makes any wall object have the stop property. But the text blocks themselves (like the ""wall"" written on the ground) are separate objects. So perhaps those text blocks can be moved if they're not stopped. Let me check the active rules. The only active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's no rule saying that text blocks are stop. So the text blocks can be moved.

So the ""wall"" rule is at (2,0) and ""is"" at (1,0), forming ""wall IS stop"". If I can move those text blocks away, then the existing walls (the ones that are objects) would no longer have the stop property. But how to move them? The player is Baba, so ""baba is you"" allows moving. The text blocks like ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc., are objects that can be moved unless they are stopped. Since there's no rule making text blocks stop, they can be moved.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule (which is at 1 step up) somewhere else. But to get there, the path is blocked by a wall. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up from the player's current position. If the player is at (3,0), then moving up to (3,1) is blocked by a wall. So how to get past the wall? Maybe by turning the wall into a non-stop object. But to do that, we need to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. To remove that rule, we need to move either the ""wall"" text block or the ""stop"" text block away.

The ""wall"" text block is at (2,0), and the ""is"" is at (1,0). So the rule ""wall IS stop"" is formed by those two. If I move either of them, the rule is broken. For example, if I move the ""is"" text block from (1,0) to somewhere else, then the rule ""wall IS stop"" is no longer active, so walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Then I could move through them.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" text block that's 1 step up. But that's blocked by a wall. So perhaps first, I need to move that wall. But the wall is stop, so I can't move it unless I change its property. This is a catch-22.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's look at other text blocks. There's a ""key"" at (4,3) and a ""ball"" at (4,4). The ""baba"" text block is at (2,5) and ""is"" at (1,5), ""you"" at (4,5). So if I can form a new rule like ""baba is key"" or something, but that might not help. Alternatively, ""key is push"" so I can push walls. But first, I need to create that rule.

But let's focus back. The immediate problem is moving the ""stop"" rule or the ""wall is stop"" rule to remove the stop property from walls. Let's see. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,1) (assuming the player is at (3,0)), but there's a wall at (3,1). So moving up isn't possible. Maybe I need to go around the walls. But the walls extend to the right and down. The door is to the right, but blocked by walls. The only open path might be down or left.

Wait, the player is at (3,0), I think. Let me try to map this out:

Current position of player (Baba): Let's assume based on the objects. The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. The ""baba"" rule is at (2,5) and ""is"" at (1,5), ""you"" at (4,5). So the player is probably at (3,5) because the ""you"" rule is at (4,5), which would make ""baba is you"" by placing the text blocks adjacent. So maybe the player is at (3,5).

Looking around, the walls are at 3 steps right in different positions. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step up from the player's position, which would be (3,4). But there's a wall at (3,4) and a rule ""stop"" there. So moving up from (3,5) to (3,4) is blocked by the wall. But if I can remove the ""stop"" rule, the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. But the ""stop"" text block is at (3,4), which is where the wall is. So moving it would require pushing the wall, but the wall is stop. Wait, unless I can change the wall's property first.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: instead of removing the stop property, create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""you can move through stop"". But how? To do that, I need to create a rule like ""baba is stop"" or ""baba is not stop"". Wait, if I can make myself not stop, then I can pass through walls. But how?

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""baba is push"", which would let me push walls. But to create that rule, I need to move the ""push"" text block. But there's no ""push"" rule here. The available text blocks are ""door"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""key"", ""baba"", ""you"". So maybe I can form ""baba is push"" by combining the existing text blocks. But where is the ""push"" text block? It's not present. So I can't create that rule.

Wait, the key is at (4,3). If I can get the key, maybe there's a rule involving the key. But again, without a ""key is..."" rule, it's not useful.

Another thought: the ""door is win"" means that if I can make the door be something else, like ""you"", then touching the door would make me win. But the current active rule is ""door is win"", so that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then just being Baba would make me win. But how? That would require creating the rule ""baba is win"".

To create that rule, I need the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" placed adjacent. Let's see where those are. The ""baba"" text block is at (2,5). The ""is"" text block is at (1,5). The ""win"" text block is at (8,1) in the current observation. So to form ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"". But how to get there?

The player is at (3,5). The ""win"" rule is at (8,1), which is quite far to the right and down. That's probably not feasible in one move. Plus, the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, look for other text blocks. The ""key"" is at (4,3). Maybe use the key to create a new rule. But without a ""key is..."" rule, it's not helpful.

Wait, another angle: the ""door is win"" rule. If I can move the ""door"" text block next to the ""win"" text block, but that might not change anything. Or maybe make ""door"" be something else. For example, if I make ""door is you"", then touching the door would make me you, but the active rule is still ""door is win"", so that wouldn't trigger the win condition.

Alternatively, if I can make ""win"" be a different object, like ""baba"", then I'd win by being Baba. But again, how?

Let's recap. The main obstacles are the walls that are stop. To pass them, either remove the ""stop"" property from walls, or make myself not stop. To remove ""stop"" from walls, need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, need to move either the ""wall"" text block at (2,0) or the ""stop"" text block at (1,1). But moving those requires getting to their positions, which might be blocked.

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, ""wall is not stop"". But there's no ""not"" text block. The available text blocks are ""door"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""key"", ""baba"", ""you"". So ""not"" isn't present. Can't form that rule.

Another idea: use the ""key"" to create a new rule. If I can pick up the key (by moving to it), but since there's no rule allowing that, maybe I can't. Unless I create a rule like ""key is you"", making the key controllable. But again, no ""key is you"" rule exists.

Wait, the player is at (3,5). The ""you"" rule is at (4,5). If I move right once, I can reach the ""you"" text block. But moving right from (3,5) to (4,5) would place me next to the ""you"" text block. Then, if I can move the ""you"" text block somewhere else, maybe I can form a new rule. But how does that help?

Alternatively, move the ""baba"" text block. The ""baba"" text block is at (2,5). If I can move it next to ""is"" and ""you"" to form ""baba is you"", but that's already the case. The active rule is ""baba is you"".

Hmm. This is challenging. Let's look at the current active rules again: ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects are walls blocking the path to the door. The key is somewhere, but not sure how it helps.

Wait, maybe the solution is to move the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,1) relative to the player's position (3,5). So moving up from (3,5) to (3,4) is blocked by a wall. But if I can move the ""stop"" rule from (1,1) to another position, like next to a wall, then the wall's stop property might be removed. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block to be next to a wall, does that change its property? Not necessarily, unless there's a rule that links ""stop"" to a property. But I think moving the ""stop"" rule would just remove it from its current position, thus deleting the ""stop"" rule for any objects it was affecting.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away. To do that, the player needs to move to its position (1,1) and then move it. But the path is blocked by a wall at (3,4). Wait, where is the ""stop"" text block located? In the current observation, the ""rule `stop` 1 step up"" is present. So if the player is at (3,5), the ""stop"" rule is 1 step up, which is (3,4). But there's a wall at (3,4). So moving up to (3,4) is impossible because it's a stop wall. Therefore, the player can't reach the ""stop"" rule to move it.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's another way. Let's look for other text blocks that can be rearranged to create a new rule. The ""key"" is at (4,3). If I can create a rule like ""key is push"", then I could push walls. But there's no ""push"" text block. Alternatively, ""key is stop"" would make the key a stop object, but that doesn't help.

Wait, the ball is at (4,4). Maybe ""ball is win"" would make touching the ball win, but the active rule is ""door is win"". So unless I can change the active rule, that won't help.

Another angle: the ""door is win"" rule. If I can move the ""door"" text block next to the ""win"" text block, forming ""door IS WIN"", but that's already the case. The active rule is already ""door is win"".

Wait, what if I can make the door be a you object? Like ""door is you"". Then touching the door would make me you, but since I'm already you, that might not help. Or if the door is win and you, then touching it would satisfy both.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" so that just being Baba makes me win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"". The ""baba"" text block is at (2,5), ""is"" at (1,5), and ""win"" is at (8,1). So I need to move the ""win"" text block from (8,1) to (2,5) area. That's a long distance, but maybe possible with multiple moves. However, the path is blocked by walls. From (3,5), moving right to reach (8,1) would require passing through several walls. For example, moving right from (3,5) to (4,5) is possible (since there's a ""you"" rule there), but then the next steps are walls. So this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, look for a way to teleport or override the walls. Another idea: use the ""key"" to create a new rule. If I can pick up the key (by moving to it), but there's no rule allowing that. Unless I can create a rule like ""key is you"", making the key controllable. But again, no ""key is you"" rule exists.

Wait, the player is at (3,5). The ""rule `you","

The goal is to reach the door which is defined as win. Right now, the active rules are door is win and baba is you. So as Baba, I need to get to the door.

Looking at the objects, the walls are stopping me. There's a wall directly in front of me to the right. The door is 8 steps to the right, but I'm blocked by walls. The key is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how?

Wait, there's a rule block ""key"" at 4 steps right, 3 down. But to move it, I might need to be able to push objects that aren't stop. The current active rules have wall as stop, so walls can't be moved. But maybe if I change the rule so that wall isn't stop, I could move them. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows moving.

Looking at the rule blocks available. There's a rule ""baba is you"" which is probably important. The ""is"" and ""you"" blocks are scattered. If I can form new rules by moving these ""is"" and ""you"" blocks together, I might be able to change what I can do.

For example, if I can move the ""key"" rule to be next to another ""is"" and ""you"" to make a new rule like ""key is you"" or ""key is win"". But first, I need to reach those rule blocks. The key is 4 right, 3 down. From my current position, how do I get there?

Let me check my current position. The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. The door is 8 steps right. The rule ""stop"" is 1 step up. So maybe I'm at position (0,0), and walls are at (3,1), (3,2), etc. The key is at (4,3). To get there, I need to move down, right, but walls are blocking. Wait, the wall at 3 steps right is blocking the path to the right. Maybe I need to change the wall's rule to not be stop. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can push a wall if it's not stop. Wait, the active rule is wall is stop, so walls are immovable. So I can't push them. Hmm. That complicates things. Then I need to find another way around.

Another thought: If I can make myself a key, then maybe I can pick up the key. But how? The rule ""key"" is a text block. If I can create a rule like ""baba is key"", then as Baba, I would be a key. Then maybe I can move the key to the door? But the door is win, so maybe that's not necessary. Or maybe the key opens the door, but the door is already win, so perhaps I just need to reach it regardless.

Wait, the door is win, so touching it would make me win. But I'm blocked by walls. So the challenge is to remove the walls or find a way around them. Since walls are stop, I can't pass through them. So maybe I need to change the wall's rule to something else. For example, if I can make wall not stop, then I can move through them.

To change the rule, I need to manipulate the text blocks. The existing rules are ""door is win"", ""baba is you"", and ""wall is stop"". The rule blocks are scattered on the map. For example, there's a ""wall"" rule at 2 steps left and a ""stop"" rule at 1 step up. Maybe I can move these to form a new rule like ""stop is nothing"" or something else that would remove the stop property from walls.

But how do I move the rule blocks? To move a rule block, I need to be able to push it, which requires that the object or rule I'm moving is not stop. Since wall is stop, I can't move walls. But the rule blocks themselves are not walls unless they're part of a rule. Wait, the rule blocks are separate objects. For example, the rule ""wall"" is a text block, which is not a wall unless it's part of a rule that defines wall as something. So maybe the rule blocks can be moved as long as they're not stop. But in the current rules, wall is stop, but the rule blocks themselves (like the ""wall"" text) are separate. Are they considered stop?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. In Baba Is You, the rules are formed by text blocks. So if a rule says ""wall is stop"", then any object named wall has the stop property. The text blocks themselves (like the ""wall"" written on a tile) are separate objects. So to move a rule block, you need to be able to move that text block. The text blocks might have their own properties. For instance, if a text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, then you can't move it. But if the text block isn't part of any rule, or its rule is modified, then you can move it.

In the current observation, the active rules are door is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The rule blocks on the map include ""stop"" at 1 step up, ""wall"" at 2 steps left, etc. So the ""stop"" rule block is a separate object. Since wall is stop, but the ""stop"" rule block itself isn't a wall. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule block to change the rule.

But how? To move the ""stop"" rule block, I need to be able to push it. Since the current rules don't say that ""stop"" is stop, unless there's a hidden rule. Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop"", which makes walls stop, but the ""stop"" text block is a different object. So unless there's a rule that says ""stop is stop"", which there isn't, the ""stop"" rule block itself isn't stop. Therefore, I can move it.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule block somewhere else to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, thereby making walls passable. Then I can go around the walls to the door.

But how to do that? Let's see. The ""stop"" rule block is 1 step up. If I can move it, perhaps by moving up to grab it. Wait, in the game, you can push objects or text blocks by moving into them from adjacent tiles. So if I'm next to the ""stop"" rule block, I can move into it, and it will push it in the direction I'm coming from.

In the current observation, the ""stop"" rule block is 1 step up. Where am I located? Let's assume my position is at (0,0). The ""stop"" rule block is at (0,1). To move the ""stop"" block up, I would need to move up into it, which would push it further up. But if I move up, I would be moving into the ""stop"" block, and it would move to (0,2). Then the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is formed by the ""wall"" rule block at (2 left) and ""is"" at (1 left,1 up), and ""stop"" at (1 up). If I move the ""stop"" block away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, because the ""stop"" part is missing.

Yes, that makes sense. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule block away, then the wall's stop property is removed. Then walls can be passed through.

So the steps would be:

1. Move up to the ""stop"" rule block (1 step up from my current position).
2. Push it up by moving up again, so it moves to 2 steps up.
3. Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because the ""stop"" part is gone.
4. Then, I can move around the walls to reach the door.

But let's check the positions again. The ""stop"" rule block is 1 step up. If I move up (action 'up'), I would be next to it. Then, moving up again would push it to 2 steps up. That should break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, the walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them. Then, I can go right to reach the door at 8 steps right.

So the next action should be 'up' to move to the ""stop"" rule block, then another 'up' to push it away. But according to the current observation, after the previous action 'up', the observation shows that the ""stop"" rule block is now 1 step up, and the walls are adjusted. Wait, looking back at the history, after the user's first action 'right', then 'up', and now the latest observation has the ""stop"" rule block at 1 step up, same as before. Wait, maybe the previous actions didn't actually move the blocks because the assistant's previous answer was 'up' which might have not been valid.

Wait, the user's previous input was 'up', which the system said failed. Then the default was 'idle'. Now, in the current observation, the ""stop"" rule block is still at 1 step up. So perhaps moving up once wasn't enough. Maybe the assistant needs to move up twice: first to reach the ""stop"" block, then push it.

But how does moving work? In Baba Is You, to push a block, you have to move into it from the adjacent tile. So if I'm adjacent to the ""stop"" block and move in the direction towards where I want to push it, the block will move one step in that direction.

So in this case, if I'm at position (0,0), and the ""stop"" block is at (0,1). To push it up, I need to move up from (0,0) to (0,1), then move up again from (0,1) to (0,2). That would push the ""stop"" block to (0,2), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But in the current observation, after the previous 'up' action, the ""stop"" block is still at 1 step up. So perhaps the assistant's previous 'up' action didn't actually place them adjacent to the ""stop"" block. Maybe the initial position is different.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant needs to move right first to get next to the ""stop"" block. Let me re-examine the map.

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule block is 1 step up. The walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So if the player (Baba) is at position (0,0), then the ""stop"" block is at (0,1). To get there, the player needs to move up once. But if moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is possible, then they can push it further up.

Wait, but in the current observation, after the previous 'up' action (which failed), the player is now in a position where the ""stop"" block is still 1 step up. Maybe the player's position hasn't changed because the 'up' action wasn't possible. Perhaps there's a wall blocking the way.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. But that's the wall's position, not the player's. The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the objects, maybe the player is at (0,0), and the walls are at (3,1), (3,2), etc. So the path up is clear. The ""stop"" block is at (0,1), which is one step up from the player. So moving 'up' should take the player there.

But the previous attempt to 'up' resulted in failure. Maybe the player was already at (0,1), so moving up again would push the ""stop"" block to (0,2). Let's check the current observation again.

In the current observation, after the previous 'idle' action, the ""stop"" rule block is still at 1 step up. So perhaps the player is adjacent to it. Therefore, the next action should be 'up' again to push it to 2 steps up.

So action: up. This would move the player to (0,1) and push the ""stop"" block to (0,2), removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls are no longer stop, and the player can move through them to reach the door at 8 steps right.

Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, the player can move right past the walls. So after moving the ""stop"" block, the active rules would be door is win and baba is you. The walls are no longer stop, so they can be passed.

Therefore, the correct action here is to move 'up' to push the ""stop"" rule block away, breaking the wall's stop property.

Let's see. The active rules are door is win and baba is you. So, I need to get to the door because that's the win condition. But how?

Looking at the objects, there's a door 8 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, right next to the door. Wait, the door is 8 steps right, so maybe the walls are in the way. Also, there's a rule 'stop' 1 step up. So any object that's stop can't be moved through.

I need to figure out how to remove the walls or change the rules. The key might be important. There's a rule 'key' at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. But how do I reach it? The current position isn't given, but maybe I can figure out the path.

Since I'm Baba, and I can push objects unless they're stop. Wait, the wall is stop, so I can't push it. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make a rule that says 'wall is not stop', then I could move through walls. But how?

The rules are on the map. There's a 'rule stop' 1 step up. Maybe if I can move that rule somewhere else or replace it. Let me check the objects again. The rule 'stop' is 1 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule, then maybe walls aren't stop anymore. But how to move it? I need to be able to move text blocks. Since Baba is you, I can move any object unless it's stop. But the rule 'stop' is a property, not sure if that affects moving text blocks.

Wait, the rules are made of text blocks like ""wall is stop"". The individual words are 'rule wall', 'rule is', 'rule stop', etc. So maybe I need to move those individual rule parts. For example, the 'stop' rule is at 1 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

But how to move the 'stop' rule. The rule is made of 'rule stop', so to delete it, maybe I need to move 'rule stop' out of the active rule. But active rules are formed when three text blocks are connected: subject, is, property. So to break the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to move either 'wall', 'is', or 'stop' so they're not connected.

Looking at the current setup: the 'wall is stop' rule is probably formed by the 'rule wall' at 2 steps left, 'rule is' at 1 step left, and 'rule stop' at 1 step up. So those three are connected to make the rule. If I can move one of them apart, the rule would be broken.

So the plan is: move the 'rule stop' (1 step up) away from the 'is' and 'wall' parts. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, allowing me to push them or move through. Then I can navigate past the walls to the door.

But how to move the 'rule stop' block. Since I'm Baba, I can move any object that's not stop. The 'stop' rule is a property, but the actual text block is a rule. So the 'rule stop' block itself isn't stop unless it's part of an active rule. But since 'wall is stop' is active, maybe the 'rule stop' is considered stop. Wait, the 'stop' property is assigned to walls, not the rule blocks. So maybe I can move the 'rule stop' block because it's not part of a stop object. Wait, the 'rule stop' is a text block that defines the stop property. But since the wall is stop because of that rule, maybe the rule block itself isn't stop. So I can move it.

If I move the 'rule stop' block away, then the 'wall is stop' rule is broken. Then walls wouldn't be stop, so I can move through them or push them. Then I can go past the walls to the door.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'rule stop' block (1 step up) somewhere else. But where? Maybe to the right or left so it's not connected to 'wall' and 'is'.

Looking at the current positions:

- 'rule wall' is 2 steps left.
- 'rule is' is 1 step left.
- 'rule stop' is 1 step up.

So if I move 'rule stop' down, say to where the 'door' rules are, maybe that breaks the connection. Alternatively, move it to the same column as the 'wall' and 'is' but in a different row so they're not connected.

But how to move it. Since the action is to choose one of the directions, maybe I need to move the 'rule stop' block by moving it in a direction that takes it away from the 'wall is' parts.

For example, the 'rule stop' is 1 step up. If I move it down, that would be moving towards the direction of the door. But I need to see if that breaks the rule.

Alternatively, perhaps moving left or right. Let me check the positions again.

The 'rule wall' is at 2 steps left, 'rule is' at 1 step left, and 'rule stop' at 1 step up. These are connected vertically. If I move the 'rule stop' down one step, it would be in the same column as the 'rule is' but one step down. Then the connection between 'rule wall', 'is', and 'stop' would be broken. That would deactivate the 'wall is stop' rule.

So the action would be to move the 'rule stop' block down. But in the game, how do you move the rule blocks? By moving them step by step, like using the up, down, left, right actions. So if 'rule stop' is 1 step up, moving it down would take it to the same position as the 'rule is' which is 1 step left. Wait, maybe not. The positions are relative. The 'rule stop' is 1 step up from where? Maybe from the player's position. But the player's position isn't specified here. This is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is located at the starting point, and the objects are positioned relative to the player. For example, the 'rule stop' is 1 step up from the player. So moving up would take the player to where the 'rule stop' is, allowing them to pick it up and move it.

Wait, the actions are for the player (Baba) to move. So the player can move up, down, left, right, or idle. Each move would take them one step in that direction. If they move into a text block, they can pick it up and move it with them.

So, for example, if the player is next to the 'rule stop' block, moving up would allow them to grab it and then move it to another location. But the problem is figuring out where the player is located relative to these objects.

Looking at the objects, the 'rule stop' is 1 step up. If the player is at the same position as the 'rule wall' or 'rule is', but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the player is at the bottom of the map, near the 'rule baba' and 'you' rules.

Assuming the player is at the position of 'rule baba' which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. To reach the 'rule stop' which is 1 step up, the player would need to move up from there. But moving up from 2 left,5 down would be to 2 left,4 down, then 2 left,3 down, etc., until reaching 1 step up. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position where the active rules are 'door is win' and 'baba is you', which might be at the bottom of the map. Let's think differently.

The key is to get to the door. The door is at 8 steps right. There are walls blocking the way. To remove the walls' 'stop' property, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'rule stop' is 1 step up. If I can move that 'rule stop' block away, then the rule is broken.

So the plan is: move the 'rule stop' block to a different spot. To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to it and then move it. Since the player is Baba and can move, they can navigate to the 'rule stop' block.

Assuming the player is at a position where moving up gets them to the 'rule stop' block. Once they move up, they can pick up the 'rule stop' block and move it elsewhere, say to the right or left, breaking the connection between 'wall', 'is', and 'stop'.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move up to reach the 'rule stop' block.
2. Move it to a new location, say to the right, so it's no longer connected to 'wall' and 'is'.

But in the current observation, after the previous actions, the 'rule stop' is still 1 step up. So the last action was 'up', which might have moved the player to where the 'rule stop' is. Then, moving right or left would move the 'rule stop' block, breaking the rule.

But in the latest observation, after the user's previous action 'up', the observation shows that the 'rule stop' is still 1 step up. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the player is not yet next to the 'rule stop' block.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to move in a different direction. Let's see.

Looking at the objects again:

- 'rule stop' is 1 step up.
- 'wall' is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up.
- The door is 8 steps to the right.

So the walls are blocking the direct path to the door. To get past them, either move them (but they're stop), or make them not stop.

To make them not stop, break the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'rule stop' is 1 step up. If I can move that 'rule stop' block away, then the rule is broken.

So the player needs to move to the position of 'rule stop' (1 step up) and then move it in a direction that disconnects it from the 'wall is' parts.

Assuming the player is at a position where moving up lands them next to 'rule stop', then moving right or left would move the 'rule stop' block, breaking the rule.

But in the current observation, after the previous 'up' action, the 'rule stop' is still 1 step up. That suggests the player hasn't reached it yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at a different location. Let's try to infer the player's position.

The 'rule baba' is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. The 'you' rule is at 5 steps down. So maybe the player starts at the position of 'rule baba', which is 2 left,5 down. To get to the 'rule stop' which is 1 step up, the player would need to move up from there.

From 2 left,5 down, moving up once would take them to 2 left,4 down. Then again to 2 left,3 down. Then up to 2 left,2 down. Then up to 2 left,1 down. Then up to 2 left,0 down (same level as the 'rule is' at 1 step left and 1 step up? Not sure about the coordinate system here.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best action is to keep moving up to reach the 'rule stop' block. Alternatively, move in a direction that allows accessing the key and then create a new rule.

Wait, there's a key at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe picking up the key allows accessing a new area or creating a rule. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make 'baba' a key or something else. For example, moving the 'key' rule to be 'baba is key', then maybe using the key to open a door. But the current active rule is 'door is win', so getting to the door is still necessary.

Another approach: change the 'win' condition. If I can make 'baba' win, then standing on the door wouldn't be necessary. But that might not help.

Wait, the active rules are 'door is win' and 'baba is you'. So to win, you need to be at the door. So the goal is to reach the door.

But walls are blocking the path. So the key is to remove the 'stop' property from walls.

Therefore, the priority is to break the 'wall is stop' rule by moving the 'rule stop' block away.

Assuming the player can reach the 'rule stop' block by moving up, then moving it to the right or left.

In the current observation, after moving up previously, the 'rule stop' is still 1 step up. So maybe the player is now next to it. The next action would be to move right or left to move the 'rule stop' block.

For example, if the player moves right, taking the 'rule stop' block with them to the right, then the 'wall is stop' rule would be broken because the 'stop' part is disconnected.

So the chosen action would be 'right' to move the 'rule stop' block to the right, breaking the rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, I need to get to the door to win. But let me check the objects around me.

Looking at the current observation, the map layout has walls on various positions. The player (Baba) is probably at a starting point, maybe near the bottom left since there's a ""rule `baba`"" 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, but in the current observation, the active rules are door is win and baba is you. So I'm controlled by Baba.

The objects on the map include doors, walls, keys, and a ball. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? There are walls blocking the path. Let me see the positions again.

The walls are spread out in a grid. To the right, there are walls at 2 steps right, 2 steps right and 1 down, etc. The key is at 3 steps right and 3 down. But to get there, I might need to move past some walls. Wait, the rule `stop` is 1 step to the left and 1 up. Does that mean walls are stoppable? Since ""wall is stop"" was a previous rule but now it's not active. Wait, the current active rules only have ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So walls are not stop anymore? Wait, no, the active rules are the ones that are currently in effect. If ""wall is stop"" was previously a rule but it's not listed now, then maybe it's no longer active. So can I push walls or move through them?

Wait, in Baba Is You, if a rule like ""wall is stop"" is active, then touching a wall stops you. If that rule is removed or changed, walls might not block movement. But in the current observation, the active rules only have ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So there's no ""wall is stop"" active. That means walls might not be blocking movement anymore. So I can walk through walls?

Wait, but the objects list includes walls at various positions. For example, wall 2 steps to the right, wall 2 right and 1 down, etc. But if walls aren't stop, then I can move through them. So maybe I can go around them.

The goal is the door, which is at 7 steps right. So the path to the door is blocked by walls. But if walls aren't stop, I can just walk over them. Let me check the positions again.

From the current position (assuming Baba is where the ""rule `baba`"" is, which is 3 left and 5 down. Wait, no, the ""rule `baba`"" is an object on the map. Wait, the objects on the map include ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"". So that's a text block saying ""BABA IS YOU"", but since ""baba is you"" is already an active rule, that text block might be redundant. So perhaps the player is at a position near that rule block.

But maybe I'm misunderstanding. The player's position isn't directly listed; instead, the objects are positioned relative to something. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is represented by the ""BABA"" text block that has the ""IS YOU"" rule attached to it. Since ""baba is you"" is an active rule, the player is the Baba object. So where is that Baba located?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left and 5 down. But that's a text block, not the actual Baba. Wait, no, the actual Baba would be the object that has the ""YOU"" rule. Since ""baba is you"" is active, the Baba tile is the one that is controlled. So perhaps the Baba is at the position of the ""BABA"" text block that's paired with the ""IS YOU"" rule. But in the current observation, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"", so the ""IS YOU"" is attached to Baba. Therefore, the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""BABA"" text block, which is 3 left and 5 down. But that's quite far from the door at 7 right. So how do I get there?

Wait, maybe I need to move right. The problem is the walls blocking the path. Let's see: between me (at 3 left, 5 down) and the door (7 right), there are walls at 2 right, 2 right and 1 down, etc. But if walls are not stop, I can walk through them. So maybe I can just move right past them.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to change what's stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I can move through walls. But how? To do that, I need to find the relevant text blocks. The ""wall is stop"" rule was present in previous observations but not in the current active rules. So maybe it's been moved or destroyed.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 2 step to the left"". So if I can move those text blocks to create a new rule, like ""wall is not stop"" or something else. But to do that, I need to be able to move the text blocks. Since the active rules only have ""baba is you"" and ""door is win"", can I move the text blocks?

In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Since ""stop"" is not an active rule here, maybe I can move the ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `is`"" blocks. Let's see their positions:

- rule `wall` is 3 steps to the left.
- rule `is` is 2 steps to the left.

If I move the ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" block, I could create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" to the right of ""wall"", then combine them to make ""wall is [something]"". But what's the something? There's a ""rule `win`"" at 7 steps right and 1 up, but that's far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that makes Baba a stop, allowing me to push blocks. Wait, but the goal is to get to the door. Another approach: if I can make the door a you, then I could be the door. But the active rule is ""door is win"", so changing that to ""door is you"" would mean I become the door, and then I can just move into it. But how to do that?

To change ""door is win"" to ""door is you"", I need to break the existing rule and create a new one. The existing rule is formed by ""door"" + ""is"" + ""win"". So if I can move the ""win"" text block away and place a ""you"" block next to it, that would work. Let's check the objects:

There's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So if I can move that ""you"" block next to the ""door"" and ""is"" blocks, I could create ""door is you"".

But to move the ""you"" block, I need to be able to move it. Since the active rules don't restrict movement (no ""stop"" rule), I can probably move it. The ""you"" block is at 1 left, 5 down. My position (Baba) is at 3 left, 5 down. So I need to move right to get to the ""you"" block.

Wait, if I move right from my current position (3 left, 5 down), each step right would bring me closer. Let's see:

Current position (assuming based on the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left, 5 down): So to move right, I'd be at 2 left, 5 down, then 1 left, 5 down, then 0 left, 5 down, etc. But there's a wall at 2 steps right (from where? Maybe the walls are positioned relative to the player's position). This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the available text blocks.

The key is at 3 right, 3 down. But I don't see a ""key is you"" or ""key is win"" rule, so getting the key might not help directly. The ball is at 4 right, 4 down, but again, no relevant rules there.

Alternatively, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 1 left and 1 up. If I can remove that rule, walls might no longer be stop. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block away or break the rule. Since I can move most blocks, I could move the ""stop"" block to another location, effectively removing the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how does that help? If walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. So the path to the door at 7 right might be clear if I can move past the walls. Let's see the wall positions:

- wall at 2 right, 1 up
- wall at 2 right
- wall at 2 right, 1 down
- etc., going down to 5 down.

So from the door at 7 right, the path to the right is clear. But from my current position (assuming I'm at the ""rule `baba`"" position, 3 left, 5 down), moving right would require passing through walls at 2 right, but if walls are not stop, I can walk through them. Wait, but the walls are objects on the map. In Baba Is You, if a wall is not stop, you can move through it, but you can't push it unless there's a ""push"" rule or something. But since there's no rule restricting movement, maybe I can just walk through the walls.

So possible steps: move right past the walls towards the door. But how many steps?

Assuming each ""step right"" moves one unit, from 3 left to 7 right would require moving 10 steps to the right, passing through walls at 2,3,4,5,6 right. But if walls are not stop, I can move through them. So maybe the solution is to keep moving right until I reach the door.

But in the previous steps, the user tried moving up and right, but the game might have required specific movements. Let me check the previous history.

In the earlier observations, the user moved right, up, right, etc., but after some steps, the action ""up"" was taken, leading to the current state. Now, in the current observation, the active rules are still door is win and baba is you. The objects are similar but with adjusted positions as the player moves.

The key point is to determine the player's current position. Since the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left and 5 down, and assuming the player is at that position, moving right would be the direction to take. However, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, but if walls are not stop, moving right past them is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different position. Another way to interpret the objects is that all positions are relative to the player. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up"" means that from the player's current position, there's a wall 4 steps right and 2 up. But if the player's position isn't explicitly listed, this can be confusing.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the player's position is determined by the ""BABA"" text block that has the ""YOU"" rule attached. In the current observation, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"", so the Baba with the ""YOU"" rule is the player. The ""rule `baba`"" object at 3 left and 5 down is the text block ""BABA"", but since ""baba is you"" is active, the player is that Baba tile. So the player's position is where the ""BABA"" text block is located, which is 3 left and 5 down.

To reach the door at 7 right, the player needs to move from 3 left, 5 down to 7 right. That's a distance of 10 steps to the right. However, there are walls along the way. But if walls are not stop, the player can move through them.

So the action would be to keep moving right. In the previous steps, the user tried moving right and up, but the current observation shows that after moving up, the walls have shifted slightly. Now, the player is possibly closer to the door.

Looking at the current objects, the door is at 7 right. The player's current position (based on ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left,5 down) needs to move right. Each step right moves the player closer.

But in the current observation, the walls are at 2 right, 1 up; 2 right; 2 right, 1 down; etc. So moving right from 3 left to 2 left (which is 1 right from the original position?), but this is getting a bit confusing with the relative positions.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position where the ""rule `baba`"" is located, which is 3 left and 5 down. To move right, the player would go to 2 left, 5 down, then 1 left, 5 down, and so on, each time moving right one step.

Given that the goal is 7 right, the player needs to move right multiple times. But in the current observation, after moving up earlier, the walls have shifted. Now, the ""rule `wall`"" is 3 steps to the left, which is further away from the player's current position.

In this scenario, the best action is to keep moving right towards the door. Each step right gets the player closer. Since there's no ""stop"" rule active, the player can move through walls. Therefore, the chosen action should be ""right"".

I need to figure out the next move in Baba Is You. Let's look at the current observation.

The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, touching the door would make me win, and I'm controlled by Baba. The goal is to reach the door.

Looking at the objects, I see walls around, some rules, a key, and a ball. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. The ball is one step below the key. The portal or exit (door) is at 6 steps right. But between me and the door, there are walls. 

Wait, where is Baba located? The map shows ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 5 steps down"". Wait, that's a text block. To control Baba, I need to be the ""you"" object. But currently, the rules are ""baba is you"", so I should be Baba. Wait, but maybe I need to confirm my position. The user's starting position isn't directly stated, but the rules might indicate where I am. 

The active rules say ""baba is you"", meaning I'm Baba. So my current position is determined by the ""baba"" text block's location. But the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is a text block that says ""BABA IS YOU"", so my position isn't directly there. Maybe I'm placed somewhere else. Hmm, perhaps the initial position of the player (Baba) is not explicitly listed here. Maybe I need to check the objects again. Wait, looking at the objects, I don't see a Baba avatar mentioned. Maybe the ""rule `baba`"" is part of the rules, not the player's position. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the objects again. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I'm Baba. The player's position isn't directly listed, but perhaps the ""baba"" text block is part of the rules. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is typically the ""you"" object, which in this case is Baba because ""baba is you"". So my position is wherever Baba is on the map. Since the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, maybe that's where the Baba icon is. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe the player starts at a default position, like the lower left corner, but the map description doesn't specify. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down. But that's a text block, not the actual Baba. The actual Baba might be inferred from the ""baba is you"" rule. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the player's position is not listed, and I need to deduce it based on the rules. For example, if there's a ""baba"" text block, perhaps that's where the player starts. But in this case, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 5 steps down. So if I move towards that, maybe that's where I am. But I can't move through walls. 

Looking at the map: the walls are forming a path. Let's visualize. The walls are at various positions. The key is at 2 right, 3 down. The ball is below that. The door is at 6 right. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 1 up. 

If I'm supposed to be Baba, maybe my current position is near the ""baba"" rule. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left and 5 down. But since the map is relative, perhaps I need to move right and up. Wait, the map's coordinates might be from the player's perspective. For example, ""4 steps to the left"" from the player would be west, and ""5 steps down"" would be south. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the possible path. The door is 6 steps to the right. But between me and the door, there are walls. To get past the walls, I might need to change a rule. The key is at 2 right, 3 down. Maybe picking up the key allows me to do something, but I don't know if there's a key rule yet. 

The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's a ""stop"" rule at 2 left and 1 up, which is a wall. So walls are stop. To move past walls, I need to either remove the ""stop"" property from them or redefine the wall. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left"". That means ""WALL IS STOP"" is a rule. So walls are stop. To move through them, I need to change that rule. For example, making ""wall is not stop"" or making myself able to pass through. 

But how? To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. The rules are ""door is win"", ""baba is you"", ""wall is stop"", ""stop is [something]"". Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"", but the ""wall is stop"" rule is present as an object. So maybe it's not active anymore? No, active rules are listed separately. Let me check the observation again. 

The active rules are: door is win, baba is you. The objects include a rule `wall` at 4 steps left. So that rule is present but not active? Or is it active? Wait, in Baba Is You, active rules are the ones that are formed by text blocks that are not blocked by other rules. For example, if there's a ""WALL IS STOP"" and a ""STOP IS PUSH"", then the active rule would be ""WALL IS PUSH"" because the second rule overrides the first. 

But in the current observation, the active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""wall is stop"" rule is present as an object but not listed as active. That suggests that there's another rule that overrides it. Wait, looking at the objects: there's a ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". So ""STOP IS [something]"". The text is cut off, but maybe it's ""STOP IS PUSH"" or another property. If that's the case, then ""wall is stop"" becomes ""wall is push"", making walls pushable instead of stop. 

Wait, the active rules are door is win, baba is you. The objects include rule `stop` at 2 left and 1 up. Let me assume that rule says ""STOP IS PUSH"". Then, since ""wall is stop"", walls would be push. So I can push walls out of the way. 

If that's the case, then the walls are pushable. So I can move them. My goal is to get to the door at 6 right. The path is blocked by walls. Let's see the layout:

From the current position (unknown), the walls are to the right and down. The key is at 2 right, 3 down. If I can get the key, maybe it opens a door or changes a rule. But I don't know if there's a key rule yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `key`"" at 3 steps right and 3 steps down is a key object. In Baba Is You, sometimes you need to pick up a key and use it on a lock. But there's no lock mentioned here. The door is the win condition. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to redefine the ""win"" condition. The active rule is ""door is win"", but if I can change that to ""baba is win"", then touching myself would win. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. 

The ""rule `win`"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move that text block next to ""baba"", then the rule becomes ""baba is win"". But to move it, I need to be able to push it. If walls are pushable (as per ""stop is push""), then I can push the ""win"" rule to where I need it. 

So the plan could be: move to the ""win"" rule at 6 right, 1 up, then push it towards the baba rule. But first, I need to navigate past the walls. 

Alternatively, since the key is present, maybe using the key to unlock something. But without a lock, it's unclear. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and can be pushed (if walls are pushable), maybe I can push the walls out of the way. For example, if there's a wall blocking my path, I can push it by moving into it from the opposite side. 

Looking at the wall positions: there are walls at 3 steps right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; etc. The door is at 6 right. So the path to the door is blocked by walls starting at 3 right. 

If walls are pushable, I can push them. Suppose I'm at position (assuming I'm near the ""baba"" rule at 4 left, 5 down). But without knowing my exact position, it's hard. Maybe I need to move towards the ""win"" rule at 6 right, 1 up. 

Alternatively, the key is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can reach the key, maybe I can use it to create a new rule. For example, ""key is push"" or something. But I need to be able to pick up the key, which in Baba Is You requires the ""key is you"" or ""baba is key"" rule. Since the current rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the key to a certain spot. 

Wait, to pick up the key, I think you need to be the same type as the ""you"" rule. Since I'm Baba (you), I can touch the key and move it. But in the game, you can move objects that are not stop. If ""key"" has no property, it's movable. 

So maybe the steps are: move towards the key, pick it up, then use it to modify a rule. For example, place the ""key"" next to ""door"" and ""is"" to make ""door is key"", but that doesn't help. Alternatively, use the key to override a rule. 

Alternatively, the ball at 4 right, 4 down might be a distraction. 

Another angle: the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 1 up, which might be ""STOP IS PUSH"" as I thought earlier. So walls are pushable. 

If I can push the walls away from the door, then I can reach it. For example, the wall at 3 right is blocking the path to the door at 6 right. If I can push that wall to the left, then the path is clear. 

But how to push it? I need to be behind the wall and move into it. Assuming I'm near the wall, moving left into it would push it. 

But where am I located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left, 5 down. If that's my position, then I'm to the west of the map. To get to the door at 6 right, I need to move east. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. 

So maybe the path is: move right from my position (4 left, 5 down) towards the center. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. If walls are pushable, I can push them. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `is`"" blocks the path. For example, if there's a rule that makes a certain direction stop, but in this case, the active rules don't seem to block movement. 

This is getting a bit too vague without knowing the exact layout. Let me try to summarize:

- I'm Baba (you).
- Goal: reach the door (win).
- Door is at 6 right.
- Path blocked by walls starting at 3 right.
- Walls are stop unless overridden. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 1 up, which might be ""STOP IS PUSH"", making walls pushable.
- Key is at 3 right, 3 down. Maybe useful for creating a new rule.
- The ""rule `win`"" is at 6 right, 1 up. Maybe I can move this to make ""baba is win"".

If walls are pushable, I can push them out of the way. For example, the wall at 3 right, 1 up: if I push it left, it moves to 2 right, 1 up. Then I can move past. 

Assuming I'm positioned to the left of the walls, moving right and pushing them. But where am I exactly? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left, 5 down. So I'm likely at that position. To reach the door at 6 right, I need to move east. 

So the steps could be:

1. Move right from 4 left, 5 down to 3 left, 5 down.
2. Then right to 2 left, 5 down.
3. Continue right, but there's a wall at 1 right, 5 down. Need to push it.
4. Push the wall at 1 right, 5 down to the left, making it move to 0 right, 5 down.
5. Then proceed right to 1 right, 5 down, which is now empty.
6. Continue right past the other walls towards the door.

But I need to navigate carefully. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change the ""door is win"" rule to ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"".

The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 1 up. If I can move that ""win"" block down to where the ""baba"" rule is (4 left, 5 down), then the rule becomes ""baba is win"", and touching myself would win. 

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" block at 6 right, 1 up, then move it down and left. But the path there is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, if I can push the walls out of the way to access the ""win"" block. 

This is quite complex. Another possibility is that the key is needed to unlock the door. If there's a ""lock"" object somewhere, but it's not mentioned here. 

Alternatively, the ball at 4 right, 4 down might be a red herring. 

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an action, perhaps the best immediate move is to move right towards the door, pushing walls if possible. But since I don't know my exact position, I'll have to assume a direction. 

Looking at the latest observation, the active rules are the same. The objects show walls and rules scattered. The key is at 3 right, 3 down. If I move down towards the key, maybe I can find a way to create a new rule. 

Alternatively, since the ""rule `is`"" blocks are present, perhaps combining them with other rules. For example, taking the ""door"" rule and ""win"" rule and placing them together to change the rule. 

But I need to be able to move the text blocks. If walls are pushable, I can push them aside to access the desired text blocks. 

Given that the previous actions were moving right and up, maybe the correct path is to keep moving right towards the door, pushing walls as needed. 

So the chosen action would be ""right"" to continue moving east towards the door, hoping to push a wall out of the way or navigate past it.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You level. I need to figure out how to get past the door which is set as the win condition. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, I need to reach the door to win. But there's a wall in the way. The walls are marked as stop, so I can't go through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a rule ""stop"" located 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. There's a wall right at the top (1 step up). The door is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But the path between me and the door is blocked by walls. Wait, where am I? The player is Baba, right? So I need to move around these walls. 

Let me visualize the layout. To the left, there's a rule ""stop"" at 3 left, 1 up. Then a wall at 1 step up. The door is to the right, but there's a wall blocking the direct path. Hmm. Maybe I can find a way to rearrange the rules to bypass the walls. 

The key here might be the ""key"" object. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. But where is Baba located? The rules mention ""rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 5 steps down"". Wait, that's probably the position of the text block ""BABA"", not the actual Baba character. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, the player is the object that has the ""YOU"" rule. Right now, ""baba is you"", so the Baba object is controlled by the player. 

So where is the actual Baba? The ""rule `baba`"" text blocks are part of the rules, not the player. The player is the Baba that's on the map. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step down, then 2, 3, etc. The key is at 1 right, 3 down. The ball is at 1 right, 4 down. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 left, 5 down. So maybe the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block? Or perhaps I need to move the ""baba"" text block to make myself a different object. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is the object that has the ""YOU"" rule. The current rules have ""baba is you"", so the player is the Baba. But where is the Baba on the map? The objects listed include walls, the door, the key, the ball, and the rule blocks. The actual Baba might be implied by the ""baba is you"" rule. So maybe the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block? Let me check the positions again. 

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down. But that's a text block, not the player. Wait, no, the player is the Baba that has the ""YOU"" property. Since ""baba is you"" is active, the Baba object (the one that's on the map) is controlled by the player. But where is that Baba? The map objects list walls, the door, the key, the ball, and the rule blocks. There's no explicit Baba object mentioned except the rule blocks. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block. If I can move that text block to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"" or ""key is you"", that could change things. But to move the text blocks, they can't be stopped. The current stop rule is ""wall is stop"", so any object that's a wall can't be moved. The rule `stop` is at 3 left, 1 up. 

Wait, the available actions are moving up, down, left, right, or idle. So I need to move Baba (the player) to a position where I can manipulate the text blocks. Let's see. The key is at 1 right, 3 down. The ball is at 1 right, 4 down. The rule `you` is at 3 left, 5 down. The rule `baba` is at 5 left, 5 down. The rule `is` is at various positions. 

If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something, but there's no lock mentioned. Alternatively, maybe rearranging the ""is"" blocks to form new rules. For example, if I can get the ""baba"" text block next to the ""win"" text block with an ""is"" in between, then ""baba is win"" would be a new rule, making Baba the win condition. But right now, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". 

The ""door is win"" rule is at 3 right, 1 up. The ""is"" rule adjacent to it is at 4 steps right and 1 up. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 1 up. So the door is set to win. To change that, I might need to move the ""door is win"" rule. But to do that, I have to move the ""door"", ""is"", or ""win"" text blocks. 

The ""door"" text block is at 3 right, 1 up. Since it's part of a rule, can I move it? The current stop rule is ""wall is stop"", so walls can't be moved. But the door isn't a wall, so perhaps it can be moved. However, the player is Baba, and the only way to move text blocks is to push them, but only if they're not stopped. 

Wait, the rules might allow moving text blocks if they're not defined as stop. The ""wall is stop"" rule makes walls immovable. So any other object, like ""door"", ""is"", ""win"", ""key"", ""ball"", or ""baba"" text blocks can be moved, provided there's no rule making them stop. 

So, if I can move the ""door"" text block, I could potentially break the ""door is win"" rule. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is win"". Let's see where the ""baba"" text block is. It's at 5 left, 5 down. The ""is"" text blocks are at various positions. For example, there's an ""is"" at 4 left, 5 down. So if I can get the ""baba"" block next to an ""is"" and then next to a ""win"" block, I could make ""baba is win"". 

But to do that, I need to navigate Baba (the player) to those positions. The player's current position isn't explicitly stated, but the ""rule `baba`"" text block is at 5 left, 5 down. Wait, that's probably the position of the text block, not the player. The player is the Baba that's controlled by the ""baba is you"" rule. So where is that Baba located on the map? The objects listed don't mention a Baba object, only walls, door, key, ball, and rule blocks. This is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the player's position is at the location of the ""rule `baba`"" text block, which is 5 left, 5 down. But that's a rule block, not the player. Hmm. Maybe I need to assume that the player is at a certain position. Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the objects, there are walls forming a grid. The door is at 5 right, 1 up. The key is at 1 right, 3 down. The ball is at 1 right, 4 down. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 left, 5 down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 3 left, 5 down. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered. 

If I'm at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block (5 left, 5 down), which is a wall (since walls are at 5 steps down in various positions), but wait, the wall at 5 steps down is at 3 step to the right and 5 steps down. So maybe the player is somewhere else. This is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player starts at the position of the ""baba"" rule block. If I can move that block to create a new rule. For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then next to ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" text block. 

The ""baba"" text block is at 5 left, 5 down. To move it right, I need to go towards the right. The current path might be blocked by walls. Let's see. From 5 left, 5 down, moving right would take me towards the center. But there are walls at 1 step down, 2, 3, 4, 5 steps down. The wall at 5 steps down is at 3 step to the right and 5 steps down. So moving right from 5 left, 5 down would go towards negative steps? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. 

Assuming that the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule block (5 left, 5 down), moving right would decrease the left steps and increase the right steps. For example, moving right once would make it 4 left, 5 down. Then again to 3 left, 5 down, and so on. But there's a wall at 3 step to the right and 5 steps down. Wait, the wall is at 3 step to the right and 5 steps down, which is directly east from the starting position? So if the player is at 5 left, 5 down, moving right three times would reach 2 left (5-3=2?), but the wall is at 3 right, 5 down. Hmm, maybe the coordinate system is such that positive steps to the right and up. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to focus on the immediate objects around me. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 left, 5 down. To move it, I need to go towards the right. Let's try moving right. Each ""right"" action would bring me closer to the center. But along the way, are there any obstacles? Between 5 left, 5 down and the center, there's a wall at 3 right, 5 down. So if I move right from 5 left, 5 down, I go to 4 left, 5 down, then 3 left, 5 down. But the wall is at 3 right, 5 down, which is the opposite direction. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged such that moving right from 5 left would actually move towards negative coordinates, which might not be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different position. Let me check the other objects. The ""rule `you`"" is at 3 left, 5 down. The ""rule `is`"" is at 4 left, 5 down. So if I can get the ""baba"" text block next to these, perhaps I can form a new rule. 

If I move the ""baba"" text block to the right, past the walls, maybe I can reach the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving right from 5 left, 5 down: first step to 4 left, 5 down (no wall mentioned there), then 3 left, 5 down (wall at 3 right, 5 down is perhaps not in the same row). Wait, the walls listed are at various positions, but the wall at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down is a separate wall. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the solution is to move the ""door is win"" rule out of the way. The ""door"" is at 3 right, 1 up. If I can move the ""door"" text block, then the ""door is win"" rule would be broken, and maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"". 

To move the ""door"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""door"" is at 3 right, 1 up. The player (Baba) needs to be next to it. But where is the player? If the player is at the ""rule `baba`"" position (5 left, 5 down), that's quite far from the door. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different location. Looking at the objects again, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 left, 5 down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 3 left, 5 down. The ""is"" rules are around there. Maybe the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block, which is 5 left, 5 down. To reach the door at 3 right, 1 up, the distance is quite large, and there are walls in between. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is important. The key is at 1 right, 3 down. If I can pick up the key and use it to unlock something, but there's no lock on the map. Maybe the key is a red herring, or perhaps it's needed to access a different area. 

Wait, the ball is at 1 right, 4 down. Maybe interacting with the ball does something, but the active rules don't mention it. 

Another approach: since ""door is win"", normally reaching the door wins. But the path is blocked by walls. So maybe I need to make the walls passable. To do that, I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, creating a rule ""wall is not stop"" or ""stop is you"". But to do that, I need to rearrange the existing rule blocks. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. But where is the player? If the player is at 5 left, 5 down, moving all the way up to 3 left, 1 up would require many moves, and there might be walls in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then Baba would be a stop, making it impossible to move. That's not helpful. 

Wait, another idea: if I can make ""door is you"", then touching the door would make me the you, but the active rule is already ""baba is you"". Hmm. 

Alternatively, create a rule ""you is win"", but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, the current active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So to win, I need to be a door. But how? Unless I can push the door to where I am, but doors are movable unless stopped. The door is at 3 right, 1 up. If I can move the door to my position, but I'm not sure where I am. 

This is quite challenging. Let me try to outline the possible steps:

1. Identify the player's position. Since ""baba is you"", the player is the Baba object. But where is that on the map? The objects listed don't include a Baba entity, only rule blocks. Maybe the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block, which is 5 left, 5 down. 

2. Move towards the key or other objects to find a way to manipulate rules. 

3. The key is at 1 right, 3 down. To reach it, need to navigate past walls. 

4. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a path or create a new rule. 

5. Alternatively, focus on rearranging the existing rules. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move that, I could remove the stop property from walls. 

6. To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. From the player's position at 5 left, 5 down, moving up and left would be necessary, but there's a wall at 1 step up (wall 1 step up). 

Wait, the wall at 1 step up is listed in the objects: ""wall 1 step up"". So if the player is trying to move up from their position, they might hit a wall. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the ""door is win"" rule out of the way. The ""door"" is at 3 right, 1 up. If I can move the door to a different location, then the ""door is win"" rule would still be active, but the door would be elsewhere. However, reaching the door's current position is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks together. The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 5 down. The ""is"" rules are at various positions, like 4 left, 5 down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 1 up. 

To form ""baba is win"", I need to get the ""baba"" block next to an ""is"" block, then next to a ""win"" block. The distance is quite large, but perhaps possible with careful movement. 

Let's try to map this out. The ""baba"" block is at 5 left, 5 down. The ""is"" block is at 4 left, 5 down. So moving the ""baba"" block one step right to 4 left, 5 down, placing it next to the ""is"" block. Then, move the ""win"" block to be next to the ""is"" block. The ""win"" block is at 5 right, 1 up. That's a far distance. 

Alternatively, use existing ""is"" blocks. There's an ""is"" block at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down (rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down). If I can move the ""baba"" block to the right and up to be adjacent to this ""is"" block, then next to a ""win"" block. 

The ""win"" block is at 5 right, 1 up. So from the ""is"" block at 1 left, 5 down, moving up and right would get to the ""win"" block. But the path is blocked by walls. 

This seems really complicated. Maybe the intended solution is","

The active rules are still ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"", which means my goal is to reach the door, and I'm controlled by Baba. Looking at the objects:

There's a wall directly above me (1 step up), so I can't go up. The door is 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 1 step up, so maybe I need to move around that. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. Not sure if I need that yet.

Hmm, the rule `stop` is 3 steps left and 1 step up. Maybe if I can move that `stop` rule somewhere else, I could navigate past the wall. But how? The walls are defined as ""wall is stop"", so if I can change the 'stop' property, maybe I can pass through. But I need to move text blocks. Let me check the positions of the rules.

The `stop` rule is 3 left and 1 up. The `door`, `is`, and `win` rules are to the right. The `wall` rules are 5 left and 4 left. The `baba`, `is`, and `you` rules are at 5 left and 4 left, 5 down. 

Wait, the `key` is at 1 right, 3 down. If I can get the key, maybe it opens a door, but the door here is just a door, not locked. So maybe the key isn't necessary. 

My current position must be somewhere near the bottom. Let's see: the walls go down to 5 steps down. The ball is at 1 right, 4 down. The `baba` rule is at 5 left, 5 down. So maybe I'm near the bottom center?

If I move right, I can reach the door eventually, but there's a wall at 1 step up. Wait, moving right from my current position, maybe I can go around the wall. Let's think: if I go right once, then down, then right again, perhaps I can avoid the wall. But the path might be blocked. Alternatively, can I move the `stop` rule to make a path?

The `stop` rule is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move that `stop` rule to somewhere else, like on top of the wall, then the wall wouldn't be a stop. But to move the `stop` rule, I need to push it, but can I? The rules say that objects with ""stop"" can't be moved. Wait, the current active rules are ""wall is stop"", so any wall is stop. But the `stop` rule itself is a text block. Is the `stop` rule movable? Since there's no rule saying that `rule` is stop, I can probably move it. 

So, if I move the `stop` rule to another position, maybe I can remove the stop property from the wall. Let's see: the wall at 1 step up is a wall because of ""wall is stop"". If I can remove that ""wall is stop"" rule, then the wall wouldn't block me. 

To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule. The `wall` rule is at 5 left and 4 left. Wait, looking at the objects: there's a `rule 'wall' 5 step to the left` and another at `4 step to the left`. The active rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by those two text blocks: ""wall IS stop"". So if I can break that by moving one of them.

But how? The `wall` rule at 5 left is part of ""wall IS stop"" when combined with the `is` and `stop` rules. If I can move the `wall` rule away from the `is` and `stop` rules, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be destroyed. 

The `wall` rule is at 5 step to the left. The `is` rule is at 4 step to the left, and `stop` is at 3 step to the left and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the `wall` rule is part of a different rule? Let me parse the active rules again. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""wall is stop"". So ""wall is stop"" is made by combining the `wall` text block with `is` and `stop` text blocks. 

Looking at the objects, the `wall` rule is at 5 step to the left. The `is` rule is at 4 step to the left, and `stop` is at 3 step to the left and 1 step up. So they are not adjacent. Therefore, the ""wall is stop"" rule is not currently active because the text blocks are not in the correct positions. Wait, that's confusing. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, the rules are formed when a subject is next to a property. For example, ""BABA IS YOU"" is formed by having the BABA text block next to IS and then YOU. So in the current observation, the ""wall is stop"" rule must be formed by the `wall` text block adjacent to `is` and then `stop`. 

Looking at the objects: there's a `rule 'wall' 5 step to the left`, a `rule 'is' 4 step to the left`, and `rule 'stop' 3 step to the left and 1 step up`. The positions are not in a line. The `wall` is at 5 left, `is` at 4 left (so adjacent horizontally), and `stop` is at 3 left and 1 up, which is diagonally from `is`. So maybe the `wall is stop` rule is not active because the text blocks aren't properly aligned. Wait, but the active rules listed include ""wall is stop"", so they must be active. How?

Ah, maybe the `wall` rule is at 5 left, the `is` is at 4 left (adjacent), and the `stop` is at 3 left and 1 up. But to form the rule ""wall is stop"", the `stop` should be adjacent to the `is`. Since the `is` is at 4 left, and `stop` is at 3 left and 1 up, they are not adjacent. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the observation, or maybe the `wall is stop` rule is formed elsewhere. 

Alternatively, maybe the `wall` rule is at 5 left, `is` at 4 left (adjacent), and `stop` is at 3 left (same row as `is` but one step left). But in the current observation, the `stop` is at 3 left and 1 up, which is one step left and one up from `is` at 4 left. So they are not adjacent. Therefore, the ""wall is stop"" rule shouldn't be active. But according to the observation, it is. This is confusing. 

Maybe there's another set of `wall`, `is`, `stop` text blocks forming the rule. Let's check all objects. There's another `rule 'wall'` at 2 step to the left (from a previous observation?), but in the current observation, the `wall` rules are at 5 left and 4 left. The `is` rules are at 4 left and 1 left. The `stop` is at 3 left and 1 up. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule is still active because the text blocks are arranged in a way that they form the rule, even if not adjacent. But in Baba Is You, the rules are formed when the subject, IS, and property are in a line, adjacent to each other. 

If the `wall` is at 5 left, `is` at 4 left (adjacent), and `stop` is at 3 left (one step left from `is`), then they are in a horizontal line. So the `stop` is one step left of `is`, which is adjacent. Therefore, the rule ""wall is stop"" would be active. Because the `wall` is adjacent to `is`, and `is` is adjacent to `stop`, forming the chain. 

So in this case, the wall at 1 step up is a wall because of ""wall is stop"". To remove that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. How? By moving one of the text blocks. 

The `wall` rule is at 5 left. If I can move that to a different position, then the chain is broken. But how to move it? Since there's no rule preventing moving text blocks (unless they are part of a STOP object). But the `wall` itself is a STOP because of the rule, but the text block ""wall"" is a rule, not an object. Wait, objects are things like Baba, door, wall, etc., while text blocks are the rules. 

So the text blocks (like `wall`, `is`, `stop`) can be moved unless they are part of a STOP object. But in this case, the walls are objects with the STOP property. The text blocks are separate. So I can move the text blocks as long as they are not stopped. 

So the `wall` text block at 5 left can be moved. If I move it away from the `is` and `stop` text blocks, the ""wall is stop"" rule will be destroyed. 

Similarly, the `rule 'stop'` is at 3 left and 1 up. If I can move that, but it's not part of any STOP object unless there's a wall there. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes what is STOP. For example, making ""door is stop"" so that the door becomes a wall. But that might block me. 

Alternatively, change ""baba is you"" to something else, but that would make me not controlling Baba. 

Wait, the goal is to reach the door, which is WIN. So the current active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I need to get to the door. 

Looking at the map, the door is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 1 step up. If I can remove the wall's STOP property, I can pass through. 

To do that, break the ""wall is stop"" rule. How? Move the `wall` text block away. The `wall` text block is at 5 left. If I move it to the right, say to 4 left, then the chain is broken. 

But how to move it? The player is Baba, controlled by ""baba is you"". The player can move unless stopped. The walls are STOP, but the text blocks are not walls unless the rule says so. 

So I can push the `wall` text block (rule) if it's not stopped. Since the `wall` text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but the rule itself is just text blocks. So moving the `wall` text block should be possible. 

So the plan is: move the `wall` text block (at 5 left) to a different position, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then the wall at 1 step up will no longer be stop, and I can move through it. 

To move the `wall` text block at 5 left, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction. But where am I currently? Let's look at the objects. 

The player (Baba) is likely at the position where the `baba` rule is. The `rule 'baba'` is at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down. So that's the position of the Baba text block. 

So I'm at 5 left, 5 down. The `wall` text block is at 5 left. Wait, same x-coordinate, but different y? Or are the positions in a grid? 

Assuming the positions are relative. If the `baba` rule is at 5 left and 5 down, and the `wall` rule is at 5 left, then they are in the same column. To move the `wall` rule, I need to be adjacent to it. Since I'm at 5 left, 5 down, and the `wall` rule is at 5 left (same x), but where in y? The `wall` rule's position is 5 step to the left, which might mean 5 steps left from the player's position. Wait, the positions are relative to the player's current location. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on moving right towards the door, avoiding the wall. If I can get past the wall at 1 step up, then proceed right. 

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that makes ""door is you"", then the door would become the player, and I could push it. But that's a longer path. 

Another idea: the key is at 1 right, 3 down. If I can get the key and then use it on the door, but I'm not sure how that works in the game. Maybe the key opens the door, but the current rule is ""door is win"", so even without a key, the door is the win condition. 

Wait, perhaps the door is just a regular door, and being next to it makes you win, regardless of a key. So maybe I don't need the key. 

So back to the main goal: reach the door at 5 right and 1 up. The problem is the wall at 1 step up. If I can remove the wall's stop property, I can go through. 

To remove ""wall is stop"", I need to break the rule. That requires moving one of the text blocks in the rule. The `wall` text block is at 5 left. If I can move that to the right, say to 4 left, then the rule is broken. 

But how to move the `wall` text block? I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm at 5 left, 5 down, and the `wall` rule is at 5 left, how far is that? If the `wall` rule is 5 steps to the left from me, that means it's to my left. To move it, I would need to be next to it. 

Wait, maybe the positions are described relative to the player. For example, ""rule 'stop' 3 step to the left and 1 step up"" means 3 steps to the left and 1 up from the player's current position. So if the player is at (0,0), then the `stop` rule is at (-3, 1). 

In that case, the `baba` rule is at (-5, -5). The `wall` rule is at (-5, ?). Let me try to map this out. 

Assuming the player is at (0,0):

- `rule 'baba'` is at 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down: (-5, -5)
- `rule 'wall'` at 5 step to the left: (-5, 0) ?
- `rule 'stop'` at 3 step left and 1 up: (-3, 1)
- The wall at 1 step up is probably an object at (0, 1) because it's 1 step up from the player's (0,0) position. But according to the observation, the wall is at 1 step up, which would be (0,1). 

But how do the text blocks relate to the objects? The wall object at (0,1) is affected by the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

To move the `wall` text block (the rule) at (-5,0), I need to be adjacent to it. The player is at (-5, -5). The `wall` rule is at (-5,0), which is 5 steps up from the player. To reach it, the player would have to move up 5 steps, but there are walls blocking the way. 

This seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps another approach is needed. 

Alternative idea: create a new rule that makes ""baba is win"", so reaching Baba (myself) would win. But that's a long shot. 

Or change the ""door is win"" to ""baba is win"". Then I just need to touch myself. 

To do that, I need to move the `door`, `is`, and `win` text blocks to form ""baba is win"". 

The `door` rule is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's position (if the player is at (0,0), door is at (3,1)). The `is` rule is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up ((4,1)), and `win` is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up ((5,1)). So currently, ""door is win"" is formed by door (3,1) -> is (4,1) -> win (5,1). 

To create ""baba is win"", I need to arrange the text blocks so that baba, is, win are adjacent. The `baba` rule is at (-5,-5). The `is` rule is at (1 step to the left and 5 steps down) from where? Wait, the `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down from the player's position. So if the player is at (0,0), that `is` rule is at (-1, -5). 

This seems complicated. Maybe it's better to focus on moving right past the wall. 

Another possibility: use the key. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. If I can pick up the key and then use it on the door. But in Baba Is You, you usually push objects. So maybe pushing the key towards the door, but I'm not sure how that helps. 

Alternatively, if I can make the key a pushable object by changing its property. For example, if ""key is you"", then I can push it. But changing that would require moving text blocks. 

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think step by step. 

Current active rules:
- door is win: I need to reach the door.
- baba is you: I control Baba.

Objects around:
- A wall directly above me (1 step up) because of ""wall is stop"".
- The door is to the right, but blocked by the wall above.
- The `stop` rule is at 3 left, 1 up. The `wall` rule is at 5 left. The `is` rule is at 4 left. So ""wall is stop"" is active because the text blocks are adjacent in a chain.

Solution: Break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving one of its components. 

To move the `wall` text block (at 5 left), I need to be adjacent to it. The player is at","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means if I get to the door, I win, and since I'm Baba, I can manipulate the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But between me and the door, there's a wall 1 step up. Also, there's a key at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock something? Wait, but how do I reach the key?

I'm currently at Baba's position, which is 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So I need to move down to get to the key. Let's see: moving down from my current position would take me to the wall at 5 steps down, but maybe there's a path around. Alternatively, maybe I can move right towards the key. But the walls are blocking the path. Let me check the map again.

The walls are arranged in a column from 1 step down to 5 steps down. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down, which is behind a wall at 1 step down. So to get the key, I need to move down past the walls, but they're all stop, so I can't go through them. Unless... maybe I can change the rule to make the wall not stop. But how?

The rules present are ""door is win"", ""baba is you"", and there's a ""rule stop"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, maybe I can remove the stop property from the walls. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that says ""wall is not stop"" or something like that. Wait, but the rules are in the format ""subject is property"". So to change ""wall is stop"", I might need to move the ""stop"" rule attached to wall or create a conflicting rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule stop"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up, and another ""rule wall"" at 5 steps left. If I can move the ""stop"" rule from being attached to wall, maybe I can reposition it to another subject. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block and the ""is"" that connects it. Wait, the rules are formed by ""[Subject] IS [Property]"", so there's an ""is"" block in between. Let me check the positions again.

There's a ""rule is"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, connected to ""rule you"" and ""rule baba"". Maybe I need to break existing rules. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. Let's see: the current rule is ""wall is stop"", formed by the ""rule wall"" at 5 steps left, ""rule is"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, and ""rule stop"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up. Wait, actually, the positions might be different. Maybe the ""is"" block is part of forming the rule. So to break ""wall is stop"", I need to move either the wall rule, the is rule, or the stop rule.

But the problem is that some objects are stop, so I can't move them unless I change their property. The ""rule stop"" is a text block, so if I can move it, that might help. Let me check where the ""rule stop"" is located. In the last observation, the ""rule stop"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block and attach it to something else, maybe I can remove the stop property from the walls.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is stop"" to make myself stop, but that would prevent me from moving. Not helpful. Maybe ""baba is key"" or something else, but that doesn't directly help with the walls.

Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a door elsewhere, but I don't know if there's a lock. The current active rules don't mention a lock. So maybe the key is a red herring, or maybe it's needed to proceed in a different way.

Alternatively, since the door is the win condition, maybe I can change the win condition to something else, like Baba itself. For example, making ""baba is win"" would mean that reaching Baba (myself) wins the level. But how? The current active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So if I can create a new rule ""baba is win"", that would override the existing ""door is win"". To do that, I need to have the ""win"" text block and attach it to ""baba"" using an ""is"" block.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule win"" at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the ""win"" rule and the ""is"" rule to form ""baba is win"", that could work. But to do that, I need to navigate to those rules, which are currently blocked by walls. The wall at 1 step up is a problem. Unless I can remove the stop property from the wall.

So here's the plan: first, find a way to remove the stop property from the wall so I can move through it. To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of ""rule wall"" at 5 steps left, ""rule is"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, and ""rule stop"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""is"" block, then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""wall is not stop"", but the game doesn't support ""not"" in rules. So maybe instead, create a conflicting rule like ""wall is key"" or something else, but that might not work. The standard is to have ""[Subject] IS [Property]"", so to remove a property, you need to either move the existing rule or create a new one that takes precedence.

Wait, in Baba Is You, when multiple rules apply, the last one or the more specific one might take precedence. But I'm not sure. Maybe the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. So, if I can move the ""rule stop"" block to a different position, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken.

The ""rule stop"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move it to, say, next to the ""baba"" rule, then maybe create a new rule. But I need to be able to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move objects that are not stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But text blocks (rules) can be moved unless they're part of a stop rule. Wait, the ""rule stop"" itself is a text block. If the wall is stop, I can't move the wall, but can I move the ""rule stop"" text block? Because the rule is ""wall is stop"", which is formed by the ""wall"" rule, ""is"" rule, and ""stop"" rule. If I move the ""stop"" rule, does that break the ""wall is stop"" rule?

Yes, I think so. So if I can move the ""rule stop"" block away from the ""is"" that connects it to the wall, then the wall would no longer be stop. Let's see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's an ""is"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""rule stop"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. To break the connection, I need to move either the ""is"" block or the ""stop"" block. Since the ""is"" block is part of the rule, moving it would break the rule.

But how do I move the ""rule stop"" block? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move objects that are not stop. The ""rule stop"" is a text block; is it considered stop? The current rules don't say ""text is stop"", so maybe I can move it. Let's check the active rules: ""door is win"", ""baba is you"". There's no rule making text blocks stop, so I can move the ""rule stop"" block.

So the plan is: move the ""rule stop"" block away from the ""is"" that's connected to the wall. Then, the wall would no longer be stop, allowing me to pass through. Once I can move through walls, I can navigate to the key or the door.

Alternatively, after removing the stop property from the wall, I can move to the door directly. The door is at 5 steps right and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 1 step up. If the wall is no longer stop, I can move through it. Wait, the wall at 1 step up is a physical wall object, not the rule. The rule ""wall is stop"" makes the wall object immovable. So if I break that rule, the wall object becomes movable? No, I think the wall object is still there, but since it's no longer stop, I can move past it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the properties affect how the objects behave. If an object is defined as stop, you can't push or move through it. If the stop rule is removed, then you can move past it. So by moving the ""rule stop"" away, the wall's stop property is removed, allowing movement through it.

So step by step:

1. Move the ""rule stop"" block to a different location to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Once the wall is no longer stop, navigate to the door at 5 steps right and 1 step up.
3. Since the door is the win condition, reaching it should solve the level.

But how to move the ""rule stop"" block? Let's look at its position. It's at 3 steps left and 1 step up. I'm currently at the position of ""rule baba"" which is 5 steps left and 5 steps down. To get to the ""rule stop"", I need to move right and up. However, the path might be blocked by other objects.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's see the current position of Baba. The observation shows ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down"". Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is an object on the map, which is a text block saying ""baba is you"". My actual position is where the Baba figure is, which might be different. Wait, the observation lists objects, including ""rule `baba`"", which is a text block, and the player's position is separate. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually the Baba figure, which is an object on the map. So I need to check where the Baba figure is located.

Looking at the objects listed:

- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `you` 5 steps down
- wall 5 steps down

So the Baba text block is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, forming the rule ""baba is you"" with the adjacent ""is"" and ""you"" blocks. But my actual position as the player (the movable Baba) is perhaps separate? Or is the player represented by the text block ""baba""?

In some levels, the player is the Baba figure, which is an object, and you can move it by pushing other objects or moving freely if not stopped. So in this case, my position is likely where the Baba figure is, which might be near the ""rule baba"" text block. But the exact position isn't specified in the observation. This is a bit confusing.

Assuming that the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down, I need to move from there. My goal is to reach the door, which is 5 steps right and 1 step up. The path is blocked by walls, but if I can remove the stop rule, I can move through them.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""rule stop"" block at 3 steps left and 1 step up.
2. Push or move the ""rule stop"" block away to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, the walls are no longer stop, so I can navigate around them.
4. Move towards the door at 5 steps right and 1 step up.

But how to move the ""rule stop"" block? Since it's a text block, and there's no rule making text blocks stop, I can move it. So I need to move right and up from my current position (assuming I'm at the baba text block). Let's see:

From the ""rule baba"" at 2 left, 5 down, I need to move right to reach the ""rule stop"" at 3 left, 1 up. The path would require moving right three times (from 2 left to 3 left, 4 left, etc.), but there are walls in the way. Wait, the walls are at certain positions. Let me check the map again.

There's a wall at 1 step up, 1 step right, 2 steps right, etc., down to 5 steps down. The ""rule stop"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. My current position is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. To get to 3 steps left and 1 step up, I need to move right once (to 1 left), then up four times. But along the way, are there any walls blocking?

Looking at the wall positions:

- wall 1 step up
- wall 2 steps right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps right and 1 step up
- etc., down to 5 steps down.

So moving up from 5 steps down to 1 step up would require passing through walls at each step? Wait, no—the walls are at specific positions. For example, wall 1 step up is at 1 step up from the starting point. If I'm at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, moving up would take me to positions relative to my current location. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the best move is to try to move right towards the door, hoping that once the wall's stop property is removed, I can proceed. Or maybe first move the ""rule stop"" block.

Another approach: since the key is present, perhaps using the key is necessary. But I don't know where the key lock is. The current rules don't mention a lock, so maybe the key is a distraction.

Wait, the ball is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the door a win condition by moving existing rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to be connected to ""baba"" instead of ""door"", then touching Baba would win. But how?

The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The ""door"" rule is there as well. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"", forming ""baba is win"", that would make touching Baba the win condition. But to do that, I need to navigate to those positions, which are blocked by walls.

So the steps would be:

1. Remove the stop property from the wall to pass through.
2. Move the ""win"" rule and ""is"" rule to connect to ""baba"".

But again, this requires moving text blocks that might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, maybe I can push other objects. If I can push a wall, but walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless the stop rule is removed.

This is getting quite complicated. Let's try to think of the immediate next move. The previous actions were right, up, right, right, up, right, right, right, which might have moved me closer to the relevant rules. Now, in the latest observation, after some right moves, I'm possibly near the ""rule stop"" block.

If I can move the ""rule stop"" block, that's key. So the action would be to move right or up towards it. But the exact direction depends on my current position relative to the ""rule stop"".

Assuming I need to move right to reach the ""rule stop"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up, from my current position at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, moving right once would take me to 1 step left, then I need to move up. But there's a wall at 1 step up, which is stop. Unless I've already removed the stop rule.

Alternatively, maybe I should first move down to avoid the wall. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: since the key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down, maybe I can get the key and use it on a lock. But without a lock, it's unclear.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""baba"" a key, but that doesn't help with the door.

Wait, the door is the win condition. If I can change the win condition to ""baba"", then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to create ""baba is win"". The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule, that would work. Let's see:

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far apart. Moving the ""win"" rule all the way to the ""baba"" rule would require passing through many walls, which I can't do if they're stop.

This seems challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""stop"" rule away first. So the next action should be to move the ""rule stop"" block. To do that, I need to move right and up from my current position.

But without knowing the exact grid layout, it's hard to say. The previous actions were mostly moving right, which might have gotten me closer to the ""rule stop"" block. So perhaps the next action is to move right again or up.

Alternatively, since the ""rule stop"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up, and my current position is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, moving right once","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the door, which is set as the win condition. But first, I need to look at the current active rules and the objects on the map.

The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, as Baba, I can move around, and the door is what I need to get to. But the problem is the walls. The walls are marked as ""stop"", which means I can't move through them. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map, there's a wall directly to the left of the door. The door is at 5 steps to the right, and there's a rule ""wall"" 5 steps to the left. So maybe that's a wall preventing me from going left directly to the door. Also, there's a key at 1 step right and 3 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant yet.

The player (Baba) is located at the starting position. Let me visualize the layout. From the observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, that might be a typo. Let me parse the objects again.

Wait, the rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down. So if I'm at that position, I need to move towards the door. But there are walls blocking the path. Let's see:

Current position of Baba: rule `baba` is 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So maybe the actual position is somewhere else. Hmm, perhaps the coordinates are relative. Let me think.

In Baba Is You, the player's position isn't directly stated, but the objects are listed with their positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up"" means there's a wall at that relative position. So the player is at the origin, and other objects are positioned relative to that.

Wait, the way the observations are structured, each object's position is described relative to the player's current location. So ""wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up"" would be a wall three spaces to the right and two up from where the player is standing.

But in the latest observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down. That must mean that the player (Baba) is actually at that position. So the player's current location is 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down from where the rule `baba` is. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

In Baba Is You, the player is represented by the text blocks that form the rule ""baba is you"". So the actual position of the player is where the ""baba"" text block is located, along with the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks forming the rule. So in the current observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" is at 4 steps to the left and 5 steps down, and ""you"" is at 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down from the current viewpoint. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's current position. This is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is fixed, and the objects are listed relative to the player. For example, if the player is at (0,0), then a wall 3 steps to the right would be at (3,0), and a wall 2 steps up would be at (0,2). But in the latest observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down. So that would be at (-5, -5) if the player is at (0,0). But that seems unlikely. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's current position, so moving right increases the x-coordinate, up increases the y-coordinate.

Wait, perhaps the way to interpret this is that each object's position is described relative to the player's current location. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up"" would be a wall located 4 units to the right and 2 units above the player's current position.

In the latest observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 5 steps down. So that would be 5 units to the left (negative x-direction) and 5 units down (negative y-direction) from the player's current position. But since the player is supposed to be Baba, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the observation structure.

Wait, no. The player's own position is determined by the rule ""baba is you"". So the ""baba"" text block is part of the rule, and the player's position is where that text block is located. So in this case, the ""baba"" text block is 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down from the current viewpoint. So the player (Baba) is at that position. Therefore, to move towards the door, which is at 5 steps to the right, the player would need to move right. But there's a wall at 1 step up, and other walls blocking the path.

Wait, let's map this out:

Player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" rule: 5 steps left and 5 down from wherever the current view is. But perhaps the coordinates are relative to the player's starting position. This is a bit confusing without a visual, but I'll try to piece it together.

The door is at 5 steps to the right. So if the player is trying to move right, but there's a wall 1 step up. Wait, the wall is at 1 step up. So if the player moves right, but there's a wall above, maybe that's blocking a path. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules to bypass the walls.

The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the player can move as Baba and needs to reach the door. The walls are stop, so can't move through them. Let's see the objects again:

- rule `stop` 3 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 1 step up
- rule `door` 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- etc.

So the path to the door (5 steps right) is blocked by walls. Let's look at the wall positions. There's a wall at 1 step up, and another wall at 5 steps left. The door is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, no: the door is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's position? Or is that relative?

I think I need to clarify the positions. If the player is at (0,0), then:

- rule `stop` is at (-3, 1)
- wall is at (0, 1)
- rule `door` is at (3, 1)
- etc.

So the door is three steps to the right and one step up from the player. But the path to the door (right and up) is blocked by walls. The wall at (0,1) is directly above the player, and another wall at (-3,1) is three steps to the left and one up. The door is at (3,1).

So the player is at (0,0), door at (3,1), but there's a wall at (0,1) and (-3,1). To reach the door, the player needs to go right, but the wall at (0,1) is blocking the upward path. Maybe there's a way to move around the walls by manipulating the rules.

The key is at (1,3), which is one step right and three steps down. The ball is at (1,4). Not sure if those are relevant yet. The rule `baba` is at (-5,-5), which is far away. Maybe the player can move towards the door by moving right, but the walls are in the way.

Wait, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the player can move as Baba. The walls are stop, meaning they can't be moved through. But perhaps the player can push objects if they are defined as movable. However, in the current rules, there's no rule allowing pushing. So the player can only move around the walls.

Looking at the path from (0,0) to (3,1):

- Moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1). But there's a wall at (0,1), so can't go up from (0,0) directly. Alternatively, move right to (1,0), then right again to (2,0), (3,0), then up to (3,1). But the door is at (3,1), which is a win condition. However, the path from (3,0) to (3,1) is blocked by a wall at (3,0)'s up position? Let me check the walls.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 1 step up: at (0,1)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down: Wait, no, in the observation, the walls are listed with their positions. Let me re-express all walls:

Walls:

1. wall 3 steps to the left and 1 step up: (-3,1)
2. wall 1 step up: (0,1)
3. wall 3 steps to the right: (3,0)
4. wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down: (3,-1)
5. wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (3,-2)
6. wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down: (3,-3)
7. wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down: (3,-4)
8. wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down: (3,-5)

Additionally, there's a rule `stop` at (-3,1), which enforces that the wall at (-3,1) is stop.

So the player is at (0,0). To reach the door at (3,1), the path would be:

(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1). But (3,0) is a wall (wall 3 steps to the right), so can't move there. Alternatively, maybe go around another way.

Alternatively, move up first. From (0,0), moving up to (0,1) is blocked by a wall. So that's no good.

What about moving down? The player is at (0,0). Moving down to (0,-1), but there's a wall at (3,-1), (3,-2), etc., but those are further right. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, there's a key at (1,3) and a ball at (1,4). Maybe those can be used to manipulate rules. For example, if the player can reach the key and then use it to create a new rule. But to get to the key, which is one step right and three steps down from (0,0), the player would have to move right and down. However, the path might be blocked.

Let's see:

From (0,0):

Right to (1,0), then down to (1,-1). But is there a wall there? The walls listed are at (3,0) and below, and (-3,1) and up. So between (0,0) and (1,0), there's nothing. Then down to (1,-1). Is there a wall there? The walls mentioned are at (3, down positions), so probably not. Then from (1,-1), right to (2,-1), down to (2,-2), etc., towards the key at (1,3). Wait, the key is at (1,3), which is up from (1,-1). So that's a bit of a climb. But maybe possible.

Once the key is obtained, perhaps the player can use it to create a new rule. For example, if the key is a movable object, the player can carry it and place it somewhere to create a new rule. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the player can push objects. But in the current rules, there's no ""push"" rule, so probably not.

Another approach: change the definition of ""win"" to something else. For example, if the player can create a rule like ""ball is win"", then reaching the ball would be the goal. But to do that, the player needs to move the text blocks ""ball"", ""is"", and ""win"" together to form ""ball is win"".

Looking at the objects, the ball is at (1,4), and the rule `win` is at (5,1) (if the player is at (0,0)). Wait, no. The rule `win` is 7 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's position. So if the player is at (0,0), rule `win` is at (7,1). That's quite far.

Alternatively, the rule `you` is at 5 steps down, 3 steps to the left. So at (-3,-5).

This is getting complicated. Maybe the solution involves moving towards the key, then using it to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""key"" text block to near the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to make ""key is win"", allowing the player to grab the key and reach it to become the win condition.

But how to move the key? The player needs to push it if possible. Since there's no ""push"" rule, maybe the player can move into the key and carry it? In Baba Is You, you can move onto objects that are not stop. If the key is not defined as stop, then the player can move onto it and carry it.

Looking at the active rules, ""wall is stop"", so walls are stop, but the key isn't mentioned. So the key is movable. So the player can move right to (1,0), then down to (1,-1), right to (2,-1), down to (2,-2), right to (3,-2), but there's a wall at (3,-2). Hmm.

Alternatively, from (0,0), move right to (1,0), then down to (1,-1), right to (2,-1), down to (2,-2), right to (3,-2) which is a wall. Can't go further right. Maybe go left instead? From (2,-1), left to (1,-1), then down to (1,-2). Then right to (2,-2), down to (2,-3). But this seems like a long way around.

Alternatively, go up. From (0,0), right to (1,0), right to (2,0), right to (3,0) which is a wall. Can't go further. Then maybe up from (2,0) to (2,1). Is there a wall there? The walls are at (0,1) and (-3,1). So (2,1) is clear. Then from (2,1), right to (3,1), which is the door. But the door is a win condition. Wait, but can the player move through the door? The door's rule is ""door is win"", which means that touching the door makes you win. So if the player can get to the door's position, they win.

But the path from (2,1) to (3,1) is blocked by a wall at (3,0), but (3,1) is the door. Wait, no. The door is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's position, which would be (3,1). So if the player can move from (2,1) to (3,1), that's the door. But is there a wall there? The walls listed are at (3,0) and below, so (3,1) is the door, not a wall. So maybe the player can move right from (2,1) to (3,1) and win.

But how to get to (2,1)? From (0,0), move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1). But (1,1) is not blocked. Then right to (2,1). Then up to (2,2). But there's no wall mentioned there. Then right to (3,1), which is the door. That seems possible.

Wait, let's outline the path:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (1,0).
2. Move up to (1,1) – is this blocked? There's a wall at (0,1), but (1,1) is clear.
3. Move right to (2,1).
4. Move up to (2,2) – no walls mentioned here.
5. Move right to (3,1) – which is the door.

This path seems feasible. So the actions would be: right, up, right, up, right.

But in the current observation, the player's position is at the rule `baba` which is 5 steps left and 5 down. Wait, this is getting confusing again. Maybe I need to re-express the positions correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 5 steps left and 5 steps down from the current viewpoint. But without knowing the current viewpoint's coordinates, it's hard to map this.

Another approach: look for movable objects that can be used to create new rules. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. If the player can reach the key, then move it to a position where it can form a new rule like ""key is win"".

To get to the key:

From the player's position (let's assume it's at (0,0)):

- Right to (1,0)
- Down to (1,-1)
- Right to (2,-1)
- Down to (2,-2)
- Right to (3,-2) – which is a wall
- So backtrack to (2,-1), down to (2,-2), left to (1,-2)
- Down to (1,-3)
- Right to (2,-3)
- Down to (2,-4)
- Right to (3,-4) – another wall
- This isn't working.

Alternatively, from (0,0):

- Right to (1,0)
- Down to (1,-1)
- Right to (2,-1)
- Down to","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you,"" which means that reaching the door will make me win, and since Baba is me, I can move around as Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, I need to see where I am. It seems like the player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, which might be near the ""baba"" rule text block that's 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down. But I need to check the current position. Wait, the observation doesn't explicitly state where the player is located. Hmm. Maybe I need to infer based on the objects listed.

The walls are arranged in a grid, with some rules scattered around. The door is to the right at 5 steps to the right. But there's a ""stop"" rule 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. That might make certain objects immovable. The key is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down, but I'm not sure if I need it to get past a wall. There's also a ball at 1 step to the right and 4 steps down, but the goal is the door, so maybe the ball isn't relevant here.

The main challenge here is the walls blocking the path to the door. The door is 5 steps to the right, but there are walls in the way. The ""stop"" rule might prevent moving through those walls. So, I need to find a way to bypass them. Since I can manipulate the rules, maybe I can change what's a stop or create a new rule to become unaffected by the stop property.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 5 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""baba is you"" rule to a different position, maybe I can alter my properties. Alternatively, I can move the ""stop"" rule out of the way or replace it with something else.

Let's think step by step. My current position isn't specified, but maybe I'm near the bottom-left corner where the ""baba"" rule is located. To reach the door, I need to go right, but the walls at 1 step up, right, and down are blocking the path. The ""stop"" rule at 3 steps left and 1 step up might be part of the wall's definition. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, maybe I can remove the stop property from the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule that makes me not stop. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS NOT STOP"" by rearranging the existing text blocks. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""stop"" rules around. Let's check the available rules. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 left 1 up, and ""is"" rules at various positions. Maybe I can take the ""stop"" rule and move it next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to form ""baba is not stop"".

But how do I move the rules? The action commands are moving directionally. So perhaps I need to move myself to the position of the ""stop"" rule, then push it somewhere else. Wait, but the player (Baba) can only move if they're not stopped. The current rules have ""wall is stop"", so any wall is stop, but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move unless there's a wall in the way. But the walls are stop, meaning I can't move through them. So the problem is navigating around the walls by rearranging the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""door is win"" to something else, but that might not help. The goal is still to reach the door as the win condition. So the priority is getting past the walls.

Looking at the map layout:

- The door is at 5 steps right.
- Walls are at 1 step up, right, 1 down, 2 down, 3 down, etc.
- The key is at 1 right, 3 down. Maybe not needed here.
- The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 5 down. If I can get to that rule and move it, maybe I can change my properties.

So, perhaps the plan is to move towards the ""baba"" rule text block, rearrange it with ""is"" and ""you"" to create a new rule that grants me immunity to stops. For example, moving the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""is"" and ""not stop"" (if possible). But I need to see if there's a ""not"" rule available. Wait, in the current objects, there's no ""not"" rule mentioned. So I have to use existing rules. The available rules are ""stop"", ""win"", ""door"", ""wall"", ""is"", ""you"", ""key"", etc.

Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is push"" or something, but I don't know if that's helpful. Wait, in Baba Is You, some properties like ""push"" allow you to move other objects. But if I can make myself push, maybe I can push walls out of the way. But that might require specific rules.

Alternatively, if I can turn the walls into something else. Since ""wall is stop"", and if I can change that to ""wall is you"", then walls would be movable. But to do that, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and break it apart. The ""wall is stop"" rule is probably composed of the ""wall"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and a ""stop"" text block. If I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" part away, then the rule would change.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 5 steps left, and a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps left. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is likely made by placing ""wall"" next to ""is"" next to ""stop"". If I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" away, the rule would become invalid. But to do that, I need to be able to move those text blocks. However, text blocks that are part of active rules might be movable unless they're part of a ""stop"" object. Wait, the rules say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if the ""stop"" rule is making certain text blocks immovable, then I can't move them. But in this case, the ""stop"" rule is a text block itself, right? So maybe the ""stop"" text block is movable unless there's a rule that says it's stop. Wait, this is a bit confusing.

In Baba Is You, when a text block is part of an active rule, it might become part of that rule's functionality. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop"", then the ""wall"" text block, ""is"" text block, and ""stop"" text block are part of that rule. If you move one of them, the rule might break. But can you move individual text blocks that are part of a rule? The tips say you can move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So if a text block is part of a ""STOP"" rule, you can't move it. But in this case, the ""stop"" rule is a text block, so unless there's a rule that says ""text is stop"", you can move it. But there's no such rule here. The ""stop"" property is applied to walls, meaning that wall objects are stop, not the text blocks.

Therefore, the ""stop"" text block itself is movable. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall is"" part, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be invalid, making walls no longer stop. That would let me pass through them.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""is"" so that the rule breaks.
3. Then, since walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them and reach the door.

But how to do that with the available actions?

Looking at the current observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. The ""wall"" rule is at 5 steps left, and the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps left. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the ""wall"" text block (5 left), ""is"" (4 left), and ""stop"" (3 left, 1 up). To break this rule, I need to move either the ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" text block out of place.

But the player's position isn't clear. Assuming I'm near the ""baba"" rule at 5 left, 5 down, I need to navigate to the area where the ""wall is stop"" rule is located. Let's see:

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. So from my position (assuming I'm at 5 left, 5 down), moving up and left would get me there. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, there's a wall at 1 step up. If I try to move up, I might hit that wall, which is a stop, and can't move through it.

This is a problem. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules first to remove the stop property from the walls before trying to move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes me immune to stops. For example, ""baba is not stop"". To do that, I need to find a ""not"" text block, but in the current objects, there's no ""not"". So that's not possible.

Another approach: since the door is the win condition, maybe I can change the win condition to something else I can reach more easily. But the door is the win, so that's the target.

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ball at 1 step right and 4 steps down. Maybe I can interact with that, but I don't see a rule that makes ball do anything. Unless there's a hidden rule, but the active rules are only door is win and baba is you.

Alternatively, maybe the key is relevant, but there's no rule about keys here. So probably not.

Back to the main problem: getting past the walls. The walls are at 1 up, right, 1 down, etc. The door is 5 steps right. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is made by the wall at 5 left, the is at 4 left, and stop at 3 left, 1 up. To break this rule, move the stop text block away.

But to get to the stop text block at 3 left, 1 up, I might need to navigate around walls. The wall at 1 step up is in the way. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move unless there's a wall (stop) in the way. So moving up from my current position (assuming I'm at the baba rule) would hit the wall at 1 step up, which is stop. So I can't move through that.

This is a catch-22. I need to move the stop text block to break the rule, but I can't get past the wall to do that. So maybe I need to find another way to deactivate the stop property of the walls.

Wait, what if I create a new rule that says ""wall is you""? Then walls would be movable. To do that, I need to take the ""wall"" text block, ""is"" text block, and ""you"" text block and arrange them. The ""you"" text block is at 5 steps down. So perhaps I can move the ""you"" text block next to ""wall"" and ""is"".

But again, to do that, I need to navigate to those positions, which might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall. If I have the ""push"" property, I can move walls. But I don't have that rule yet. To get ""push"", I might need to create a rule like ""baba is push"". But again, that requires rearranging text blocks.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Identify all relevant text blocks for the ""wall is stop"" rule: wall (5 left), is (4 left), stop (3 left, 1 up).
2. To break this rule, move one of these text blocks.
3. The ""stop"" text block is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move it, perhaps by pushing it with another object, but I don't have the push rule yet.
4. Alternatively, create a new rule that negates the stop property for walls. But no ""not"" rule exists.

Alternative idea: Since the door is the win, maybe I can change the win condition to something else I can reach. For example, make ""baba"" the win by creating ""baba is win"". But the active rule is ""door is win"", so unless I break that rule, it remains. To break ""door is win"", I need to move the ""win"" text block away from the ""door"" and ""is"".

The ""door is win"" rule is composed of door (3 steps right, 1 up), is (4 steps right, 1 up), win (5 steps right, 1 up). So if I can move the ""win"" text block away, then ""door is win"" becomes invalid, and the win condition reverts to the default, which might be reaching a door (but the rule was explicitly set). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, create a new ""baba is win"" rule. To do that, I need to place ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together. The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 5 down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right, 1 up. So moving from my position (assuming I'm at the baba rule), I need to navigate to the area where ""win"" is, but there are walls in the way.

This seems really challenging. Maybe another approach: Since I can move the text blocks that are not stop, perhaps I can move the ""is"" from the ""wall is stop"" rule and use it to create a new rule that makes me not stop.

For example, if I move the ""is"" text block to connect with ""baba"" and ""not stop"" (but there's no ""not""), or ""baba"" and ""you"" to make ""baba is you"", which is already active.

Wait, the active rule ""baba is you"" is already there. So maybe I need to create another rule that gives me a property that allows me to move through stops. Like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is key"".

But to create ""baba is push"", I need the ""push"" text block, which doesn't exist in the current objects. The available rules are door, is, stop, wall, win, you, key. No push.

Alternatively, maybe ""baba is move"", but again, no such text block.

Hmm. This puzzle is tricky. Let's recap the positions:

- Player (Baba) is likely at the ""baba"" rule text block at 5 left, 5 down.
- The door is at 5 steps right.
- Walls are blocking the path: 1 up, right, 1 down, etc.
- The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up, which is part of making walls stop.

Possible moves:

1. Try to move right towards the door, but there's a wall at 1 step right (part of the wall is stop rule).
2. Move up to reach the ""stop"" text block, but there's a wall at 1 step up.
3. Move left to the area of the ""wall is stop"" rule, but again, walls are blocking.

Wait, the wall at 1 step up is part of the vertical wall structure. If I can move that wall, maybe by breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, then I can pass through.

But moving the wall would require the push property, which I don't have. Unless I can create a push rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall a you, then I can move it. But that would require creating ""wall is you"". Let's see: the ""you"" text block is at 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""you"" text block next to ""wall"" and ""is"", that would create ""wall is you"", making walls movable.

To do that, I need to:

- Move the ""you"" text block from 5 down to near the ""wall"" and ""is"" text blocks.

But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. For example, moving down from the ""baba"" rule would hit a wall at 5 steps down. Moving right would hit the wall at 1 step right.

This seems impossible without first removing the stop property from the walls.

Alternative idea: Use the key. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. Maybe there's a rule involving the key that I'm missing. But the active rules don't mention the key. Unless the key is part of a hidden rule, but according to the observation, the active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"".

Alternatively, maybe the key is a red herring, and the solution doesn't involve it.

Another angle: Since the ball is at 1 step right and 4 steps down, and there's a ""rule `key`"" at 4 steps right and 3 steps down, maybe there's a key involved in unlocking something. But without a ""key is ..."" rule, I don't know.

Wait, the ""key"" text block is present. Maybe creating a rule like ""key is win"" or ""key is push"". But again, without knowing the effects, it's hard to say.

Back to the main issue: How to get past the walls. The core problem is the ""wall is stop"" rule. To break it, I need to move one of its components. The ""stop"" text block is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move that to another position, the rule would break.

Assuming the player is at the ""baba"" rule (5 left, 5 down), to reach the ""stop"" text block at 3 left, 1 up, I need to move left and up, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, moving left from 5 left would take me to 4 left, which is a wall (from the ""wall is stop"" rule at 5 left, 4 left is the ""is"" text block, and 3 left, 1 up is the ""stop"" text block). Wait, perhaps the layout is such that the walls are arranged vertically and horizontally.

Alternatively, maybe the map is a grid where each position","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the door, which is set as ""win"". But I need to check the active rules.

From the current observation, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, since I'm Baba, following the ""baba is you"" rule means I can move around. But there are walls defined as ""stop"", which I can't pass through.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door 5 steps to the right. To get there, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall 5 steps to the left, which might be blocking a path. Wait, the walls are positioned at various steps up, down, and so on. Let me visualize the map.

The rule `stop` is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. There's a wall 1 step up. Then, the door and related rules are 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Further right, there are more walls and a door at 5 steps to the right. Below that, there's a key at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down, and a ball at 1 step right and 4 steps down. There's also a ""baba"" rule text block 5 steps to the left and 5 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"".

The problem is that the path directly right to the door might be blocked by walls. Let me check each step. If I move right from my current position, I need to see if there are walls in the way. For instance, moving right once gets me to the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. Wait, no—the wall at 1 step up is separate. Let me clarify the positions.

The initial position isn't specified, but based on the objects listed, maybe the player (Baba) is near the left side. The key and ball are down below, but the door is to the right. The walls are spread out horizontally and vertically. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down, which might be a detour. 

But the active rules haven't changed yet. Since ""baba is you"", I can push objects that aren't ""stop"". Wait, ""wall is stop"" is not in the active rules anymore? Let me check. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So walls are not explicitly ""stop""? Wait, in the initial problem description, the user mentioned that ""wall is stop"" was an active rule, but in the current observation, it's not listed. So maybe that rule was altered in previous steps. 

So if walls are not ""stop"" anymore, I can push them? Or maybe the ""stop"" rule was moved or changed. Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means walls might not block me unless there's another rule making them stop. But if ""wall is stop"" was part of the initial setup but has been moved or modified, then maybe walls aren't stopping me now. 

Wait, but in the previous steps, the user had to move text blocks to change rules. For example, earlier observations had ""wall is stop"" as an active rule, but now it's not. So perhaps the player moved the ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else, making walls not stop anymore. If that's the case, then I can walk through walls, which changes the strategy. 

But how can I confirm that? Let me check the current active rules again. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's no ""wall is stop"", so walls might not be impassable. That would mean I can walk through them, which is a big difference. 

If walls aren't stopping me, then the path to the door at 5 steps right is clear. But the problem is that in the previous steps, the assistant was moving right multiple times, but the game kept failing. Maybe the issue is that the player isn't at the correct starting position, or there's another rule blocking the path. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ""key"" or ""ball"" objects are relevant. The key is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. If I need to pick up the key to unlock the door, but the current rules don't state that the key is required. The door is just ""win"", so maybe interacting with the door is enough. 

Wait, but how do I reach the door? If there are no walls blocking the path, I can just keep moving right. Let me count the steps. The door is 5 steps to the right. If the player is at position 0, then moving right five times would reach the door. But in the previous actions, the assistant kept moving right, but the game didn't proceed. Maybe the player is not adjacent to the door yet, or there's a miscount in the steps. 

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to manipulate the rules further. For example, changing ""door is win"" to something else, or making Baba have another property. But with the current rules, being Baba allows movement, and the door is the win condition. 

Wait, but the player might have to push a wall if they are in a position where they can't walk around. But if walls don't block, then pushing isn't necessary. 

Another possibility is that the ""you"" rule is important. The current active rules have ""baba is you"", so that's correct. If the ""you"" rule was moved, then the player wouldn't control Baba. But in the current observation, ""baba is you"" is active, so that's fine. 

Given all this, the simplest solution might be to keep moving right towards the door. However, the previous attempts resulted in failures, possibly because the player wasn't in the correct position to move right each time. Alternatively, maybe there's a hidden wall or a rule that's still active. 

Wait, looking at the objects again: there's a rule `stop` 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. But that's a text block, not an active rule. The active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So that rule `stop` is just lying on the ground and not affecting anything. 

Therefore, the player can move freely unless there are walls defined as stop. But since ""wall is stop"" is not an active rule, walls are passable. So the path to the door at 5 steps right should be clear. 

In that case, the correct action would be to move right repeatedly until reaching the door. However, in the previous steps, the assistant kept moving right but failed. Maybe the issue is that the player's position isn't correctly mapped, or there's a misunderstanding in the step counts. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to interact with the key or ball first. For example, if the door requires a key, but the current rules don't mention that. The key is present, but unless there's a rule like ""door needs key"", it's unnecessary. 

Another angle: maybe the ""win"" rule is dynamic. If the door is win, then reaching it ends the level. So the solution is to move right to the door. 

Given all this, the best action is to continue moving right towards the door. Since the walls aren't stopping, this should work. But why did previous right movements fail? Perhaps because the player wasn't adjacent to the door yet, or there was a miscount in the steps. 

In the latest observation, the door is 5 steps to the right. If the player is one step away, then moving right once would reach it. But if the player is further left, multiple right movements are needed. 

Assuming the player needs to get to the door at 5 steps right, the correct action is to keep moving right. Therefore, the next action should be ""right"".

Let's see where I am now. The active rules are still ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, my goal is to get to the door, which is the win condition. But how do I get there without hitting walls?

Looking at the objects on the map, the door is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. But there's a wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Also, there's a rule `stop` 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. Wait, but the wall is right in front of the door's path up. So I need to either move around the wall or find a way to remove the wall's stop property.

The other objects include a key at 3 steps down, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The ball is at 4 steps down, which might not be important. The rule `baba` is at 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down, but since I'm Baba, maybe I can manipulate those rules.

Wait, since ""baba is you"", I can pick up text blocks. The rule `door` is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""door"" text block next to ""win"" and ""is"", maybe I can change the win condition. Or maybe move ""is"" to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or something else.

But first, I need to get past the wall blocking the door's upward path. The wall is at 1 step left and 1 step up, and there's a ""stop"" rule there. Since I can move objects that aren't stopped, but the wall is stopped. Wait, the rule says ""wall is stop"", which means walls are stop. So I can't push them. But maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Looking at the current rules, there's a ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 4 step to the left"". So the ""wall is stop"" rule is probably at 5 left and 4 left positions. If I can move those text blocks, I might be able to remove the ""stop"" property from walls.

But how do I reach those text blocks? The rule `stop` is at 4 steps left and 1 step up. That's near the wall. If I move left, maybe I can get to the ""stop"" rule. But moving left might take me into another wall. Let me check the map again.

Current position: Not explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. The door is 4 steps right and 1 up. So maybe I'm positioned somewhere in the middle. Let's assume I'm at the starting point, perhaps next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 6 steps left and 5 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need to move right towards the door.

Wait, the key is at 3 steps down. If I go down, maybe there's a way to get past the walls. But the door is up, so that's the main target. Let me think about possible moves.

If I go right towards the door, there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. But if I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls, then walls become passable. To do that, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and either move it or break it into parts. The ""wall is stop"" rule is likely composed of the ""rule `wall`"" text block and the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `stop`"" connected.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 4 step to the left"", which probably form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move these text blocks apart, the rule breaks. So maybe moving the ""rule `wall`"" to a different position would disrupt the rule.

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that makes walls not stop. For example, ""baba is stop"" would make me a stop, which is bad. Or ""you is stop"", but since I'm you (baba), that's not good. Alternatively, ""wall is not stop"", but how to phrase that.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can create new rules by combining subjects and properties. So if I move the ""stop"" rule to be under a different subject, like ""baba is stop"", that would make me stop. Not helpful. But if I can take the ""stop"" rule and attach it to something else, maybe ""key is stop"", but the key isn't the goal right now.

Alternatively, maybe I need to reach the ""door is win"" rule and move it somewhere else. But the door is already set to win. The problem is the wall blocking the path.

Another angle: The ""rule `key` 3 steps down"" is present. Do I need the key to open the door? The current rule says door is win, so maybe the key isn't necessary unless the door is locked. But since the active rule is door is win, just reaching the door should win the level. So the key might be a red herring or for another purpose.

So back to the wall. The wall is at 1 step left and 1 step up, and it's stopped. To get past it, I need to either make it passable or go around. But going around would require navigating other walls. Let's check the map layout.

From the current observation, moving up 1 step would hit the wall. Moving right towards the door is possible, but there's a wall at 3 steps down, 1 step to the left. Wait, the walls are arranged in a column on the left and right sides. Maybe the path up is blocked, but there's a way around on the right.

Wait, the door is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I move right four times and up once, I reach the door. But between me and the door, there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. So I need to avoid that wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can break that rule, walls would no longer be stop. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is located. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 5 steps left, and ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps left, and ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the text blocks at 5 left (wall), 4 left (is), and 3 left and 1 up (stop). If I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" away from the ""wall"", the rule breaks.

But how to reach those text blocks? My current position might be somewhere in the middle. Let's assume I'm near the lower part of the map. The ball is at 4 steps down, and the ""baba"" rule is at 6 left and 5 down. Maybe I need to move down to reach the key or other text blocks.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"", making myself the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""win"" rule is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""win"" to be connected to ""baba"" and ""is"", then ""baba is win"" would be created.

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to navigate past the walls. The ""win"" is above the door, which is behind a wall. So maybe moving right and up towards the ""win"" rule would help. But the path is blocked.

Another thought: The ""rule `you` 5 steps down"" is present. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe changing ""you"" to something else could help. But not sure.

Alternatively, if I can push the wall by repositioning it, but since walls are stop, I can't push them. So that's not possible.

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 6 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text block next to ""is"" and ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be created. Let's see: the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, and ""win"" is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far. Maybe I need to move the ""baba"" rule to the right and up.

But to move the ""baba"" rule, I have to navigate through the map. The current position is unclear, but assuming I'm somewhere in the lower part, maybe moving right and up step by step.

Alternatively, let's consider the sequence of previous actions. The user tried moving right multiple times, up, etc., but failed. Now the observation shows that after moving right, the ""stop"" rule is now at 4 steps left and 1 step up, and the wall at 1 left and 1 up. So perhaps moving right has shifted some objects.

In the latest observation, the door is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right four times and up once. But the wall is in the way. So maybe the solution is to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule to remove the stop property from walls.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left"", ""rule `is` 4 step to the left"", and ""rule `stop` 3 step to the left and 1 step up"". These three form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" away from ""wall"", the rule breaks.

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to the right, connecting it to something else instead of ""wall"". But where can I move it? If I move the ""is"" to be between ""baba"" and ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be created, making me win. That seems promising.

The ""baba"" rule is at 6 steps left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"", that would create the new rule. Let's see:

The ""win"" rule is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So moving the ""is"" rule from 4 left,5 down to, say, 5 left,5 down (right one step), then connecting it to ""baba"" at 6 left,5 down and ""win"" at 4 right,1 up. But the positions are quite apart. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule closer to ""baba"". The ""baba"" rule is at 6 left,5 down. The ""is"" is at 4 left,5 down. If I move the ""is"" right one step to 5 left,5 down, then place it between ""baba"" (6 left) and... but there's no object at 5 left,5 down except the moved ""is"". Then connect ""baba"" to ""is"" to ""win"". But ""win"" is up and to the right, so maybe not adjacent.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the easiest way is to focus on moving the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" is at 3 left,1 up. If I can move it to a different location, say, next to ""key"" or something else, it might not be part of the ""wall is stop"" rule anymore.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Assuming I'm near the ""stop"" rule, which is at 3 left,1 up. If I move up from my current position, I might reach it. But my current position isn't clear. However, based on previous observations, after moving right multiple times, the ""stop"" rule's position has changed.

In the latest observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 step to the left and 1 step up. Wait, the observation says:

""rule `stop` 4 step to the left and 1 step up""

So the ""stop"" rule is now further left compared to previous steps. If I can move this ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall is stop"" structure, that would break the rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by ""rule `wall`"" at 5 left, ""rule `is`"" at 4 left, and ""rule `stop`"" at 4 left and 1 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule down or somewhere else, the connection breaks.

So, the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once walls are no longer stop, I can push them or walk through them.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" rule at 4 left,1 up. From my current position, which is not explicitly stated, but the door is 4 right and 1 up. Assuming I'm to the left of the door, moving right might get me closer.

Alternatively, if I'm near the ""baba"" rule at 6 left,5 down, moving right and up could reach the ""stop"" rule.

But this is getting too vague without knowing the exact starting position. Let's think of possible moves step by step.

Current active rules: door is win, baba is you.

Objects around me (assuming I'm near the lower part with the ball and key):

- To the right: walls forming a barrier.
- Above: a wall that's stop.
- The door is up and to the right, blocked by a stop wall.

The key is down at 3 steps down, but not sure if needed.

The solution likely involves either removing the stop property from walls or creating a new rule that makes the door or myself the win condition.

To remove the stop property from walls, break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The components are ""rule `wall`"" at 5 left, ""rule `is`"" at 4 left, and ""rule `stop`"" at 4 left,1 up.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""is"", then the rule breaks. For example, move the ""stop"" rule down or to the right.

Assuming I can move the ""stop"" rule, the action would be to move right towards it, pick it up, and then move it down or left.

But how to reach the ""stop"" rule at 4 left,1 up from my current position. If I'm at the position where the door is 4 right and 1 up, then moving left four steps would get me to the ""wall"" rule, but that's probably not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move the ""is"" rule away from the ""wall"" and ""stop"", the rule breaks.

The ""is"" rule is at 4 left,5 down. If I move it up or down, it might disconnect from the ""wall"" and ""stop"".

But this requires navigating to that position. It's a bit complex.

Another angle: Since the door is the win condition, maybe I can push the wall out of the way by repositioning it. But walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless I change their property.

Wait, if I can make the wall not stop, then I can push it. So breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule allows that.

So the priority is to break that rule. To do that, either move the ""stop"" rule away, or move the ""is"" or ""wall"" parts apart.

Given the current positions:

- ""rule `wall`"" is at 5 left.
- ""rule `is`"" is at 4 left.
- ""rule `stop`"" is at 4 left,1 up.

These are connected to form ""wall is stop"". To break this, move either the ""is"" or ""stop"" away.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule down, then it's no longer connected to the ""is"" and ""wall"".

Assuming I can move the ""stop"" rule down, the action would be to move down towards it, pick it up, and then move it down again.

But how to get to the ""stop"" rule's location. Let's see:

The ""stop"" rule is at 4 left,1 up. If I'm currently positioned at, say, the starting point near the ""baba"" rule at 6 left,5 down, moving right four times and up one would get to the door. But the wall is blocking.

Alternatively, maybe I'm near the ""key"" at 3 steps down. Moving up from there could reach the ""stop"" rule.

This is getting too speculative without knowing the exact starting position. But based on the latest observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 left,1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 left,5 down. So they're not adjacent. To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to disconnect the ""is"" from either ""wall"" or ""stop"".

Perhaps moving the ""is"" rule up or down. If I move the ""is"" rule up one step, it's no longer connected to the ""wall"" and ""stop"", breaking the rule.

But the ""is"" rule is at 4 left,5 down. Moving it up to 4 left,4 down would disconnect it from the ""wall"" at 5 left and ""stop"" at 4 left,1 up. That might work.

So the action would be to move the ""is"" rule up. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move it.

Assuming I can reach the ""is"" rule at 4 left,5 down, moving up would position it at 4 left,4 down, disconnecting it from the ""wall"" and ""stop"".

Once that's done, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, meaning walls are no longer stop. Then I can walk through them or move them.

With that, I can go around the wall blocking the door's path.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 4 left,5 down.
2. Move the ""is"" rule up to 4 left,4 down.
3. Now walls are not stop, so navigate around them to the door.

But how to execute this in the game? The action required is a single move, either up, down, left, right, or idle.

Given that the previous actions were moving right and up,","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are door is win and baba is you. That means if I can reach the door, I win. But first, I need to look at the objects on the map.

Looking at the observation, I see there are walls everywhere except maybe some paths. There's a rule `stop` to the left and up, which probably makes that area immovable. The door is 4 steps to the right and up, but there are walls blocking the way. Wait, the door is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But between me and the door, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up? Or is that a different position?

Wait, the objects list shows rule `door` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Then rule `is` 3 steps right and 1 step up, then rule `win` 4 steps right and 1 step up. So the door is at 4 steps right, 1 step up. But there's a wall at 1 step to the left? No, the wall is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe my position is somewhere else. The user hasn't specified where Baba is, but since I'm ""baba is you"", I must be positioned somewhere on the map.

Looking at the objects, the rule `baba` is at 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, that's probably the Baba text block, not my position. Oh right, the player's position isn't directly listed here. The active rules and objects are other elements. So I need to infer my position based on the relative positions of the objects.

Assuming I'm starting somewhere, maybe near the bottom or top. Let's see. The walls are forming a structure. The door is at 4 steps right, 1 step up. But there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So if I'm trying to go up to the door, I might be blocked by that wall. The key is at 3 steps down, which might be a way to pass through a wall. But I don't see a rule that says key is open or anything. Maybe I need to move the key to somewhere else?

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The current rules are door is win and baba is you. If I can change the 'win' rule to point to something else, like the ball, then getting the ball would make me win. But how to do that? I need to move the 'win' text block to be under 'ball'. But where is the 'win' rule located? It's at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move that 'win' rule next to the ball, which is at 4 steps down, that might not be possible because they are in different directions.

Wait, the ball is at 4 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So they are in different quadrants. Maybe I need to move the 'win' rule to the ball's location. But how? If I can move the text blocks, I need to find them. The 'win' rule is a text block, so if it's not stopped, I can move it. But looking at the active rules, there's 'wall is stop', which means any object with 'wall' property is stop. But the 'win' rule is a separate text block, right? So if 'win' isn't under 'stop', I can move it.

Wait, the active rules are door is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So 'stop' applies to walls. The 'win' rule itself isn't stopped unless there's another rule saying 'rule is stop' or something. But I don't see that. So the 'win' text block can be moved. If I can move the 'win' rule to be under the ball, then the rule would be 'ball is win', and touching the ball would make me win. That might be a solution.

But how to get to the 'win' rule? It's at 4 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, but that's a wall object, which is stop. So I can't go through it. Maybe I need to go around. Let's see the layout:

- Up direction: There's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up, then rule `door` at 2 steps right and 1 step up, followed by `is`, `win` at 4 steps right, 1 step up.

- Down direction: There are walls at 1 step left and increasing steps down, and a ball at 4 steps down.

- Right direction: Walls at various positions.

So maybe the path to the 'win' rule is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule by pushing it if it's not stopped. Since 'win' is a text block and 'wall is stop', unless 'win' is considered a wall, which it's not, I can move it. So if I can reach the 'win' text block at 4 steps right, 1 step up, I can move it next to the ball at 4 steps down. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe I can change the 'door is win' rule to something else. If I can break that rule, then the door wouldn't be the win condition. But breaking a rule usually requires moving the 'is' text block. The 'door is win' rule is made of 'door' and 'is' and 'win'. The 'is' is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move that 'is' text block away, the rule would break, and door would no longer be win. Then, if I can make another rule where, say, baba is win, then touching a door or something else would not be necessary. But I need to create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself (baba) win by creating a rule like 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to have the 'baba' text block and 'win' text block next to an 'is' text block. The 'baba' rule is at 6 steps left and 5 steps down, and 'win' is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The 'is' rules are at various positions. The closest 'is' is at 5 steps left and 5 steps down (part of the 'you' rule: rule `you` 5 steps down, which is probably 'baba is you' broken into parts). Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I need to push objects. But the walls are stop, so I can't push them. The key is at 3 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to unlock a wall, but there's no rule about key unlocking. Alternatively, maybe the key is a red herring.

Wait, the ball is at 4 steps down. If I can reach the ball, and if the rule was 'ball is win', then that would be the win condition. But how to set that up. Let's think: To make 'ball is win', I need to have the text blocks 'ball', 'is', and 'win' arranged as a rule. The current 'win' is at 4 steps right, 1 step up. The ball is at 4 steps down. The 'is' text blocks are at various positions. Maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the ball's location by pushing it through the map. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' text block near the ball and 'win' to form 'ball is win'. Let's see: The 'is' at 5 steps left and 5 steps down is part of the 'you' rule (rule `you` 5 steps down). If I can move that 'is' block down to where the ball is, and then place the 'win' block next to it, that could create the new rule. But how to do that without getting blocked by walls.

This is quite complex. Maybe the simplest way is to try to move towards the door, but the path is blocked. So perhaps I need to change the 'win' rule to the ball. To do that, I need to access the 'win' text block. It's at 4 steps right, 1 step up. How to get there? Let's map the possible movements.

Assuming my current position is somewhere. Let's suppose I'm at the position of the 'baba' text block, which is 6 steps left and 5 steps down. But that's a text block, not my position. Wait, the player's position isn't given directly. Maybe I'm in a different location. Alternatively, perhaps I'm near the bottom because the ball is at 4 steps down, and walls are descending from there.

Alternatively, maybe I'm at the starting point, which is not explicitly mentioned. This is tricky. Let's try to deduce based on the objects.

The door is at 4 steps right, 1 step up. The 'win' rule is there. To get to the door, I need to go right and up, but there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. So maybe I need to go around that wall. Let's see: If I move right past the wall at 1 step left and 1 step up, but the wall is at 1 step left and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from where? Maybe from my current position. If I'm to the right of that wall, I can move up. But without knowing my position, this is difficult.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on moving the 'win' rule to the ball. Let's see: The 'win' rule is at 4 steps right, 1 step up. The ball is at 4 steps down. The 'is' text blocks are scattered. If I can get the 'win' rule down to where the ball is, and then have an 'is' between 'ball' and 'win', that would work. But how to move the 'win' rule down.

Assuming I can move the 'win' rule block, which is a text block, since it's not stopped (only walls are stop). So if I can push it down, past the walls. There's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step down, but that's a different direction. The path from the 'win' rule at 4R,1U to the ball at 4D would require moving down 4 steps, but there are walls at 1L,1D; 1L,2D; 1L,3D; 1L,4D. So if I'm moving the 'win' block down, I need to go around those walls. Maybe possible by moving right first, then down, but the 'win' block is already at 4R, so moving right more isn't possible. Alternatively, moving left around the walls, but that's 1L direction. Hmm.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to create a new rule where 'baba' is 'win'. To do that, I need to have the 'baba' text block, 'is', and 'win' arranged. The 'baba' text block is at 6L,5D. The 'win' is at 4R,1U. The 'is' text blocks are at various places. The closest 'is' is at 5L,5D (part of the 'you' rule). So if I can move the 'is' from 5L,5D to between 'baba' and 'win', that would create 'baba is win'. But how to move those blocks.

Assuming I can move the 'is' block from 5L,5D to, say, 4R,5D (between 'baba' at 6L,5D and 'win' at 4R,1U), that might not be possible due to the path. There are walls at 1L,1D; 1L,2D; etc., so moving the 'is' block from 5L,5D to 4R,5D would require crossing through those walls, which are stop. Unless the 'is' block is not stopped, but 'wall is stop', so other objects like 'is' are movable.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'win' rule to the ball. Let's try to think step by step.

1. Locate the 'win' rule block at 4R,1U.
2. Move this block down towards the ball at 4D.
3. To do that, push it down past the walls at 1L,1D; 1L,2D; etc. But how? If the 'win' block can be moved, then each move would decrement the down step. But the path might be blocked by other walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'key' block, which is at 3D, to somewhere. Not sure how that helps.

Another idea: Since 'baba is you', maybe I can push a wall if it's not stopped. But 'wall is stop', so I can't push walls. So I'm stuck between moving text blocks and avoiding walls.

Wait, the 'key' is at 3 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to move a wall, but there's no rule about keys unlocking. Maybe the key is a distraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move the 'door is win' rule apart and create a new rule. For example, move the 'is' from 3R,1U away, so the door is no longer win, then create 'baba is win' or 'ball is win'.

To break the 'door is win' rule, I need to move the 'is' block that's part of it. The 'is' is at 3R,1U. If I can move that 'is' block to another position, the rule breaks. Then I can create a new rule.

So steps:

1. Move the 'is' block at 3R,1U to somewhere else.
2. Create a new rule, like 'baba is win' or 'ball is win'.

But how to do that. Let's see:

First, I need to access the 'is' block at 3R,1U. To move it, I have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. Assuming I can move there, but there might be walls blocking the path.

The 'is' block is at 3R,1U. To get there, I might need to move right and up from my current position. But where am I? If I'm near the bottom, maybe I can move up and right.

Alternatively, maybe I'm at the position of the 'baba' text block, which is 6L,5D. From there, moving right and up would be towards the 'is' block. But there are walls at 1L,1U; 1L,2D; etc. So the path might be blocked.

This is really challenging without knowing the exact starting position. Maybe I need to make an educated guess.

Assuming I'm near the bottom, next to the ball. The ball is at 4D. If I'm there, I can move up towards the 'win' rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, I can try to move the 'win' rule down to the ball.

Another approach: Since the key is at 3D, maybe I can move it to a position that allows accessing other text blocks. But I don't see a use for the key yet.

Wait, maybe the solution is simpler. The current active rules are door is win and baba is you. So touching the door wins. The door is at 4R,1U. But there's a wall at 1L,1U. So maybe I need to move that wall. But walls are stop, so I can't. Alternatively, move the door? The door is a rule 'door' at 4R,1U. If I can move the 'door' text block, then maybe place it next to the win rule. But the door's position is part of the rule 'door is win', so moving the 'door' block would change the rule.

For example, if I move the 'door' block to be next to the 'win' block, the rule would still be 'door is win' because the 'is' is in between. So that might not help.

Alternatively, move the 'win' block to be next to the door, but that doesn't change anything.

Hmm. Maybe I need to create a new rule that makes Baba win by default. Like 'baba is win'. To do that, I need the 'baba' text block, 'is', and 'win' arranged. The 'baba' text block is at 6L,5D. The 'win' is at 4R,1U. The 'is' text blocks are at various places. The closest 'is' is at 5L,5D (part of 'you' rule: 'baba is you' broken into 'rule `baba`', 'rule `is`', 'rule `you`'). So if I can move that 'is' from 5L,5D to between 'baba' and 'win', that would create 'baba is win'.

So steps:

1. Move the 'is' block from 5L,5D to a position between 'baba' (6L,5D) and 'win' (4R,1U). But the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving right from 5L,5D to 4L,5D, then down to where 'baba' is? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 'is' block at 5L,5D can be moved down to 5L,4D, then right to 4L,4D, etc., but again, walls are in the way.

This seems really complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'win' rule to the ball. Let's try:

1. Move the 'win' block at 4R,1U down to 4R,4D (next to the ball at 4D).
2. To do that, push the 'win' block down four steps. But each step might require avoiding walls. For example, moving down from 4R,1U to 4R,2U (is that blocked?), then to 3U, etc. But there are walls at 1L,1D; 1L,2D; etc. So moving the 'win' block down would require going around those","

15,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The game is Baba Is You, and the goal is usually to get to the door, which is set as win. Right now, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"", which means I (Baba) can move and the door is the target.

Looking at the objects on the map, I need to see where Baba is located. The rules mention ""rule `baba` 6 step to the left and 5 steps down"". Wait, that probably means the Baba text block is at that position. But where is the actual Baba? Since ""baba is you"", I should be able to move wherever there's a Baba object. But the observation doesn't explicitly list a Baba object; instead, there's a rule `baba` somewhere. Maybe the player is represented by the Baba rule? Or perhaps I need to move the Baba rule to create a ""baba you"" rule? Hmm, that might be necessary.

The key here is to figure out how to reach the door. The door is at 4 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are described as ""wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up"", and several walls down below. The rule `key` is at 3 steps down, and there's a ball at 4 steps down. Not sure if the key is relevant yet.

Since I'm Baba and can move, I need to navigate past the walls. But the walls are marked as stop, so I can't pass through them. The only way is to either move around them or change the rules to make the walls not stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I can walk through them. But how?

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""rule `stop` 4 step to the left and 1 step up"". If I can move that rule somewhere else or reassign it, I might be able to remove the stop property from walls. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. Moving text blocks requires that they are not defined as stop or similar immovable properties. Wait, the current active rules are door is win and baba is you. So, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule since it's not tagged as stop itself? Or is the ""stop"" rule considered part of the stop property?

This is a bit confusing. Let me parse the active rules again. The active rules are door is win and baba is you. The other rules like stop, wall, etc., are just text blocks on the map, not active rules unless they're formatted as ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So right now, the only active rules are door is win and baba is you. The rest are potential rules that can be moved to create new rules.

So, the walls are there because there's a ""rule `wall` ..."" somewhere, but the active rule is wall is stop? Wait, no. The active rules are door is win and baba is you. The wall's property isn't defined as stop unless there's a rule like ""wall is stop"". Looking at the objects, there is a ""rule `stop` 4 step to the left and 1 step up"". But that's a separate rule. So the actual stop property comes from that rule? Or is the wall's stop property inherent?

In Baba Is You, the stop property is an active rule. So if there's a rule ""wall is stop"", then walls are stop. But in the current observation, the active rules are only door is win and baba is you. So where is the ""wall is stop"" rule coming from? Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 6 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 5 step to the left"". Wait, maybe those are parts of the wall is stop rule. For example, ""wall is stop"" would be composed of the rule `wall` followed by rule `is` followed by rule `stop`. So if those are placed together, they form the active rule.

But in the current observation, the objects are scattered. The ""rule `wall` 6 step to the left"" is separate from the ""rule `is` 5 step to the left"" and ""rule `stop` 4 step to the left and 1 step up"". So they aren't adjacent, meaning the ""wall is stop"" rule isn't active. Therefore, the walls might not be stop right now? Wait, that can't be. Because in the initial levels, walls are usually stop. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup here.

Alternatively, maybe the active rules are door is win and baba is you, and the other rules are just on the map but not active. So the walls are present as objects but their stop property isn't active unless there's a corresponding rule. So in this case, since there's no active rule ""wall is stop"", the walls might not be stop. That would mean I can walk through them? But that seems unlikely. Maybe the presence of the wall object itself makes it a stop, but according to the game mechanics, it's the rules that determine behavior. So unless there's an active rule stating that wall is stop, they are just normal objects.

This is a bit confusing. Let me check the previous observations. In earlier steps, there was an active rule ""wall is stop"", but now it's not listed. So perhaps the player moved that rule away, making walls not stop. If that's the case, then I can walk through the walls. But in the current observation, the active rules are only door is win and baba is you. So walls might not be stop anymore. Then why are there walls blocking the path?

Alternatively, maybe the walls are still stop because of their object type, but according to the game rules, it's the active rules that matter. So if there's no ""wall is stop"" rule active, then walls are not stop. That would change everything. So the player can potentially walk through walls unless there's an active stop rule.

In that case, the path to the door at 4 steps to the right might be clear, except for the walls that are just objects. But looking at the map layout, the walls are positioned in a way that blocks the direct path. For example, there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, which might be near the player's starting position. If I can move right towards the door, maybe I can get there without obstruction.

But where exactly is the player (Baba) located? The rule `baba` is at 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So the player is at that position. The door is at 4 steps to the right. So the player is quite far left, and needs to move right multiple times, passing through the walls. But if the walls are not stop, then moving right would be possible.

However, the previous steps had the player moving right multiple times, but the game kept defaulting to idle because the actions weren't valid. Maybe the direction was incorrect relative to the player's position. For example, if the player is at 6 steps left and 5 down, moving right would decrease the left steps and increase the right steps. Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. The observation says ""rule `baba` 6 step to the left and 5 steps down"", which probably means the Baba is located 6 steps to the left from the reference point and 5 steps down. But the reference point isn't specified, so maybe the player needs to check their relative position to other objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block. So to move towards the door at 4 steps to the right, the player needs to move right multiple times. But in previous attempts, the assistant kept outputting ""right"", but the game didn't accept it, defaulting to idle. That suggests that moving right isn't a valid action at the moment, maybe because the player is blocked by a wall that is still considered stop.

Wait, but earlier observations had the active rule ""wall is stop"", but in the current observation, that rule is gone. Let me check again. The current active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So if there's no ""wall is stop"" active, then the walls are not stop, and the player can move through them. Therefore, the player can just walk right towards the door.

But why was the previous action ""right"" invalid? Maybe the player's position is such that moving right isn't possible due to the map layout. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at 6 steps left and 5 down (rule `baba` position), and the door is at 4 steps right. So the player is to the far left, and needs to move right. Between them are several walls arranged in a grid. If the walls are not stop, then the player can walk through them. But if moving right from the player's position would take them into a wall that is still stop, even without the active rule, that could block movement.

Alternatively, perhaps the walls are still stop because they are part of the level's layout, but according to the game mechanics, it's the active rules that define their behavior. So if there's no active ""wall is stop"", then the walls are just normal objects and can be walked over.

In that case, the solution would be to move right towards the door. But the previous attempts to move right failed, which might mean that the direction is incorrect or there's another obstacle. Maybe the player needs to adjust their path, like moving down first to avoid walls.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, which is near the player's position. If the player is at 6 steps left and 5 down, moving up would decrease the down steps. But the door is to the right, so maybe moving right is the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to grab the key at 3 steps down and then use it to open the door, but the door is already set as win, so maybe the key isn't necessary.

Another possibility is that the player needs to rearrange the rules to make themselves win instead of the door. For example, creating a ""baba is win"" rule. To do that, the player would need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""win"" rule is currently at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 6 steps left and 5 steps down. These are quite far apart, so the player would need to navigate through the map to bring them together.

But navigating through the map requires moving past walls. If the walls are not stop, then it's possible. The player's current position is 6 left, 5 down. To get to the ""win"" rule at 4 right, 1 up, they would need to move right multiple times and up a bit. However, the path might be blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 up, which is close to the player's position. Moving right from there would take the player towards the door.

Alternatively, the player could move down to the area with the key and ball, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Another angle: since the door is the win condition, and it's actively set as win, the player just needs to reach it. If the walls are not stop, then moving right repeatedly should work. But the previous actions didn't work, which suggests that either the direction is wrong or the player is blocked.

Wait, the player's position is 6 steps left and 5 steps down. The door is at 4 steps right. So the player is quite far to the left. To move right, they would have to go from left to right, passing through various walls. But the walls are arranged in a grid that might require moving down or up to navigate around them.

For example, the walls at 1 step left and 1 up, then 1 step left and 2 down, etc. Maybe the player needs to move down first to get past the upper walls, then move right.

Alternatively, the player could move up towards the ""door"" rule, but the door object is at 4 steps right, which is in the same general direction as moving right.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible path:

1. Player is at (6 left, 5 down).
2. Door is at (4 right, ?). Need to clarify coordinates.
3. Walls are blocking the direct path. If they are not stop, move right.
4. If walls are stop, need to change the rules to make them not stop.

Assuming walls are not stop, the player can move right. But why did previous ""right"" actions fail? Maybe the coordinate system is such that moving right from the player's position doesn't lead directly to the door because of the grid layout.

Alternatively, the player might need to move in a specific sequence, like right, up, right, etc., to navigate around the walls.

Another thought: the ""rule `baba`"" is separate from the player's object. In Baba Is You, the player is represented by the ""baba"" text block that is made ""you"" by a rule. In this case, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so the player is the Baba text block at 6 left, 5 down. To move, the player can move this text block, but only if it's not stopped by another rule.

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player character is usually the object that is ""you"". So if ""baba is you"", then the player is the Baba object. But where is the Baba object? It's possible that the Baba object is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" text block. So moving the ""baba"" rule would move the player.

Therefore, to move the player, the assistant needs to output actions that move the ""baba"" rule text block. For example, to move the ""baba"" rule one step right, the action would be ""right"", which would move the rule and thus the player.

But in the previous attempts, moving right didn't work. Maybe the ""baba"" rule is blocked by another rule or object that is stop. For example, if there's a wall that is stop, even if the active rule isn't ""wall is stop"", the wall's presence might block movement.

Alternatively, the ""baba"" rule might be stuck because other rules are in its way. The assistant needs to figure out the correct direction to move the ""baba"" rule to reach the door.

Given that the door is at 4 steps to the right, and the player is at 6 steps left, the player needs to move right 10 steps (6 left to 0, then +4 right). But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions, so the player needs to find a path.

Alternatively, the player can rearrange the rules to create a ""baba is win"" rule, making themselves the win condition. To do that, the player would need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, while the ""baba"" rule is at 6 left and 5 down. These are quite far apart, but maybe there's a way to move them closer.

For example, move the ""baba"" rule down to the area with the other rules, then move the ""win"" rule next to it. This would require navigating through the map, possibly moving past walls.

But how to move the ""baba"" rule? The player needs to output directions that move the ""baba"" rule text block. Each action (up, down, left, right) would move the rule one step in that direction, assuming it's not blocked by a stop rule.

In the current observation, there's no active ""stop"" rule, so maybe the player can move the ""baba"" rule freely. The ""baba"" rule is at 6 left, 5 down. To get to the ""win"" rule at 4 right, 1 up, the player would need to move right multiple times and up a few steps, avoiding any walls that might still be stop.

But the walls are objects, not active stop rules, so they shouldn't block movement. Therefore, the player can move around them.

Alternatively, the player might need to push other rules to create the desired rule. For example, moving the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" rule to form ""baba is win"".

This seems like a plausible solution. The player would need to:

1. Move the ""baba"" rule to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule.
2. Then move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule.
3. This would create the ""baba is win"" rule, making the player the win condition.

But the player's current position is at the ""baba"" rule. So moving the ""baba"" rule right would require actions like ""right"" repeatedly until it's next to the ""is"" rule.

Looking at the objects, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down (rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down). The ""baba"" rule is at 6 steps left and 5 steps down. So to get the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, the player needs to move left 5 times (from 6 left to 1 left), which would place it adjacent to the ""is"" rule at 1 left. Then move up or down to align with the ""is"" rule.

Once ""baba"" is next to ""is"", then move the ""win"" rule (which is at 4 steps right and 1 step up) next to the ""is"" rule. This would form ""baba is win"", changing the win condition to the player.

This seems like a viable plan. The steps would be:

1. Move left from the ""baba"" rule at 6 left, 5 down to 1 left, 5 down (adjacent to ""is"" at 1 left,5 down).
2. Then move up or down to align with the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""win"" rule from 4 right,1 up to be next to the ""is"" rule.

However, moving the ""win"" rule would require it to be moved as a separate action. Each movement of a rule requires the player to be adjacent to it and output the direction to move it.

But the player is currently at the ""baba"" rule. So first, the player needs to move to the ""is"" rule, then move the ""win"" rule next to it.

This is getting quite complex, but it's a possible solution. The alternative is to simply move towards the door, assuming walls are not stop.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, perhaps the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win"". Therefore, the","

Let's try to figure out what the user is trying to do here. They're playing Baba Is You, and based on the observations, the goal is usually to get to the door, which is set as the win condition. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you,"" meaning that Baba is the player and the door needs to be reached.

Looking at the current observation, the player (Baba) is probably at the starting position. The walls are arranged in a pattern, and there's a door up ahead. But there might be obstacles in the way. The key and ball objects are present, but I'm not sure if they're relevant yet.

The latest observation shows that after some moves, the rules have shifted slightly. The ""stop"" rule is now 4 steps to the left and 1 step up. There are walls positioned around, and the door is 4 steps to the right. The rule blocks might have moved as the player navigates, changing the layout.

The previous attempts by the user resulted in failed actions because the assistant didn't provide a valid move. Now, the system is prompting for a specific action. The challenge here is to determine which direction to move next to reach the door without hitting a wall.

From the current map, moving right seems possible since the door is to the right, but there are walls at certain positions. Let's break down the positions:

- The player (Baba) is likely where the ""baba"" rule is located, which is at 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, no, looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down. But the player is defined by ""baba is you,"" so maybe the player's position is where the ""baba"" text block is? Or is it the icon representing Baba?

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down. But that seems far from the door at 4 steps to the right. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's current position. The observations list objects relative to the player. So ""3 steps to the right"" would be in the positive x-direction.

Looking again: The door is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's a wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up, and a rule 'door' 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So the path upwards to the door might be blocked by a wall at 1 step left and up. But the door is 4 steps right and up. So maybe moving right towards the door, but need to navigate around walls.

The latest observation shows that after moving right several times, the ""stop"" rule has moved, and the walls are arranged differently. The key is at 3 steps down, but that's below the player. The ball is at 4 steps down, also below. The door is above and to the right.

The active rules are still ""door is win"" and ""baba is you,"" so the player needs to reach the door. The previous actions were moving right, up, etc., but maybe the path is now clearer. Let's check the current positions:

- The player (Baba) is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" which is 6 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, that might mean the player is somewhere else. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point. This is a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, the objects are listed relative to the player's current position. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right"" means there's a wall three steps to the right of where the player is standing now. So the player is looking around and sees these objects in different directions.

In the latest observation, the door is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's a wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up, which could block the upward path. To reach the door, the player might need to go around the wall. Since the door is to the right and up, perhaps moving right first, then up when possible.

But the previous attempts had the player moving right multiple times, leading to changes in the rule positions. Now, the ""stop"" rule is further left, and the walls are adjusted. The key is at 3 steps down, which might not be necessary right now. The ball is at 4 steps down, but again, not sure if needed.

The critical point is to reach the door. The current active rules don't prohibit moving through other objects unless they're marked as STOP. The walls are STOP, so the player can't move into them. The door is WIN, so reaching it would win the level.

So the path could be: move right towards the door. Check if there's a wall in the way. From the observation, moving right 4 steps gets to the door. But between the player and the door, are there any walls? The latest observation shows walls at 1 step left and up, but the door is 4 steps right and 1 step up. So the path to the door would require moving right, then up, but there's a wall at 1 step left and up. Wait, that wall is to the left of the player's current position, so if the player is moving right, that wall isn't in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to adjust their position. Let's try to map this out:

Assume the player is at position (0,0).

- Wall at 1 step left and 1 step up: (-1,1)
- Rule 'door' at 2 steps right and 1 step up: (2,1)
- Door itself is at 4 steps right and 1 step up: (4,1)
- So from (0,0), moving right to (1,0), (2,0), etc., towards (4,0), then up to (4,1) which is the door.

But between (0,0) and (4,0), are there walls? The observation mentions walls at 3 steps to the right, 1 step up, etc., but maybe not directly in the path. The walls at 3 steps right could be further along.

Alternatively, the player might need to move up first to avoid the wall at (-1,1), but that's to the left. If the player moves right, they can go around.

The key is at 3 steps down, which is (0,-3). The ball is at 4 steps down (0,-4). These might not be relevant unless they're required to unlock something, but the current rules don't mention anything about a key.

Given that the door is straight ahead to the right and up, and the active rules are door is win and baba is you, the solution is likely to move towards the door, avoiding walls. Since the latest observation shows that moving right multiple times has adjusted the rule positions but the door is still accessible, the next logical move is to continue moving right towards the door.

But wait, in the previous steps, moving right multiple times led to the door being further away? Or did the layout change? The user's history shows a series of right and up moves, but the assistant's answers kept failing. Maybe the path is blocked by walls that weren't immediately obvious.

Looking at the current observation: the door is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up, but that's to the left of the player's current position. The walls further right are at 3 steps right, 1 step up, etc., but those are beyond the door's position. So moving right towards the door should be possible, as long as there are no walls in between.

The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps left and 1 step up, which is far from the player's current position. So moving right should not hit a STOP wall unless there's one in the way.

Therefore, the best action is to move right towards the door. The previous attempts might have been blocked by walls that are no longer in the path after the rules shifted. So the next move should be right.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. I'm Baba, and the goal is to get to the door which is defined as win. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So right now, I can move around because ""baba is you"" means I control Baba. The problem is getting past the walls and maybe using the key or the ball.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at (1 step left and 3 steps down) and a ball at (1 step left and 4 steps down). There are walls blocking the path towards the door. The door is to the right, but there's a wall right next to it at 3 steps to the right. Wait, maybe that wall can be moved or modified?

I notice there are several rules on the map. For example, there's a ""rule 'stop' 5 step to the left and 1 step up"". If I can move that 'stop' rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the stop property from a wall. Or maybe create a new rule that changes 'wall' to something else.

But first, I need to get to the key or ball. The key might be useful to unlock the door, but the door is already the win condition. The ball—maybe I can push it into a position? But I don't see any 'push' rule here. The active rules are only about what objects are win, you, etc.

Wait, the rules on the map include ""rule 'wall' 7 step to the left"". If I can move that 'wall' rule, perhaps I can change the property of another object. But how? To move a rule, I have to touch it, right? And then maybe attach it to a different object.

Looking at my current position, I'm not sure where I am exactly. The observations show various objects, but I need to figure out where I'm located. Let's assume I'm starting near the bottom left because the 'baba' rule is at 7 steps left and 5 steps down. Maybe I need to move up to reach the rules above.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 5 steps left and 5 steps down. If I can make myself 'you' again, but I already am. Wait, the active rules are 'door is win' and 'baba is you', so I'm already the you object.

Another idea: The 'win' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. The door is there. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. If I can make that wall not a stop, then I can go through. To do that, I need to either remove the 'stop' property from the wall or change the wall's rule.

Looking at the rules, there's a 'rule 'stop' 5 step to the left and 1 step up'. If I can move that 'stop' rule away and attach it to something else, maybe the wall can become passable. But how to move the 'stop' rule?

I need to move the 'stop' rule. To do that, I have to move the text block that says 'stop' to a different location. The 'stop' rule is 5 steps left and 1 step up. If I can push that text block somewhere else, like attach it to a different subject, maybe the wall becomes not stop.

But how do I move the text blocks? I have to be adjacent to them and move in a direction. Let's see, if I'm near the 'stop' rule, I can move it. Suppose I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule (7 left, 5 down). To get to the 'stop' rule at 5 left, 1 up, I need to move right 2 steps and up 4 steps. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at 2 step left and 1 step up, then 1 step left and 3 down, etc. Maybe there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key or ball to push something. But I don't see a 'push' rule. The only active rules are about win and you. So maybe I need to create a new rule. For example, if I can make 'baba' 'stop' or 'win', but that might block me or change the goal.

Wait, the current active rules are door is win and baba is you. If I can change 'baba' to 'win', then I could become the win object. But how? By moving the 'win' rule to apply to 'baba'. The 'win' rule is currently at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that text block to say 'baba is win', then I would be the win. But how to do that.

To move the 'win' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The 'win' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can get there, I can move it. But the path is blocked by a wall at 3 steps right. Unless I can remove the wall's stop property.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to unlock the door. But I don't know if there's a rule for that. The key is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can pick up the key and use it on the door, but I don't see any interaction rules for using items.

Another angle: The 'rule 'you' 5 step to the left and 5 steps down' is present. If I can make 'baba' the 'you' again, but I think that's already the case. The active rule is 'baba is you', so that's covered.

Wait, maybe the solution is to move the 'stop' rule away from the wall. For example, the wall at 3 steps right is a 'stop' because of the 'rule 'stop' 5 step to the left and 1 step up'. If I can move that 'stop' rule to a different object, like the ball or the key, then the wall wouldn't be a stop anymore.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' rule from its current position (5 left, 1 up) to attach it to, say, the wall at 3 steps right. But wait, the 'stop' rule is a general rule. Maybe if I move it to the wall, it would make that wall a stop. That's the opposite of what I want. Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that says 'wall is not stop' or 'stop is you', but I don't have the ability to create new rules unless I can rearrange existing ones.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks to create new rules. For example, if there's a 'baba' text block and an 'is' text block and a 'you' text block next to each other, you can push them together to make 'baba is you'.

In the current map, there are several 'is' rules. For example, at 7 steps right and 1 step up, there's a 'rule 'is''. Maybe I can use these 'is' rules to create new combinations.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule 'baba' 2 step to the left and 5 steps down', a 'rule 'is' 1 step to the left and 5 steps down', and a 'rule 'you' 5 steps down'. If I can move these together, I can create a new rule. For instance, moving 'baba', 'is', and 'you' together would make 'baba is you', which is already active. Maybe combining them with another object?

Alternatively, if I can make 'baba' 'win' by moving the 'win' rule to 'baba'. The 'win' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that text block to the 'baba' rule, which is at 7 step left and 5 steps down, that would create 'baba is win', making me the win condition.

But the problem is the path between me and those text blocks. Let's see. The 'win' rule is to the right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Unless I can remove that wall's stop property.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock something. But I don't see a lock object. The door is the win condition, but it's a door, which in some levels requires a key. However, in this level, the active rule is 'door is win', so having the door open might not be necessary. Or maybe the door is closed, and the key is required to open it. But the observation doesn't mention a locked door, just 'door is win'.

Wait, maybe the door is already open because the rule is 'door is win', so touching it would win. But there's a wall right next to it at 3 steps right. So I need to get past that wall.

To remove the wall's stop property, I need to change its rule. The 'stop' rule is at 5 left, 1 up. If I can move that 'stop' rule to another object, like the ball or the key, then the wall at 3 right wouldn't be a stop.

But how to move the 'stop' rule. Let's think about the positions. The 'stop' rule is at 5 left, 1 up. To get there, I might need to move from my current position. Assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's position (7 left, 5 down), moving right 2 steps and up 4 steps would get me to 5 left, 1 up. But the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 2 left, 1 up is one obstacle. Maybe I can move that wall's rule.

The 'wall' rule is at 6 left. If I can move that 'wall' rule away, perhaps the wall at 2 left, 1 up would no longer be a wall. Then I could pass through.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan:

1. Identify all relevant text blocks that can be moved to create new rules.
2. Determine which walls are stopping progress and how to remove their stop properties.
3. Use available objects like the key or ball to interact with the environment.
4. Manipulate the 'stop' rule to affect different objects, making walls passable.
5. Navigate to the door by removing obstacles.

But given the time constraints and previous failed attempts, maybe the immediate action is to move right towards the door, hoping that the walls can be manipulated through rule changes. Alternatively, try to move the 'stop' rule by moving adjacent text blocks.

Wait, the 'is' rules are scattered. If I can push an 'is' rule next to the 'stop' rule and a different subject, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the 'stop' rule to be next to 'wall' and 'is', making 'wall is stop', which it already is. That doesn't help.

Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule to 'baba', making 'baba is stop', which would block me. Not good.

Hmm. Another idea: The 'key' is at 1 left, 3 down. If I can move the key to the door, maybe that interacts, but there's no rule about keys opening doors here. The active rule is just 'door is win'.

Maybe the solution is to push the wall that's blocking the path to the door. But without a 'push' rule, I can't push objects. The only way to move objects is to move text blocks that define their properties.

Wait, the walls are defined by 'wall' rules. If I can remove the 'wall' rule from the object blocking the door, then it becomes passable. The blocking wall is at 3 steps right. Its 'wall' rule is at 6 left. So if I can move that 'wall' rule away, the object at 3 right would no longer be a wall.

To move the 'wall' rule at 6 left, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. Let's see where I am. The 'baba' rule is at 7 left, 5 down. To reach 6 left, I need to move left once. But there's a wall at 5 step left and 5 down. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, if I can move the 'is' rule at 5 left, 5 down to attach to the 'wall' rule at 6 left, creating a new rule. For example, 'wall is you' or something. But that might not help.

This is tricky. Maybe the key is a red herring. The ball is also there. Maybe pushing the ball into a position that affects the rules. But without a 'push' rule, I can't.

Wait, another angle: The 'you' rule is at 4 step left and 5 steps down. If I can move that 'you' rule to myself (Baba), but I already am 'you' because of 'baba is you'.

Perhaps the solution is to create a new rule that makes 'baba' 'win'. To do that, I need to have the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks adjacent and move them together. The 'win' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. The 'baba' rule is at 7 left, 5 down. These are quite far apart. There must be a way to move them closer.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' rules to link them. For example, there's an 'is' rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down. If I can move that 'is' rule next to the 'baba' rule and the 'win' rule, I could create 'baba is win'.

But how to get those text blocks together. Let's think about the positions:

- 'baba' rule: 7 left, 5 down
- 'is' rule: 1 left, 5 down
- 'win' rule: 3 right, 1 up

This seems too scattered. Maybe another 'is' rule at 4 right, 1 up. If I can move the 'is' at 7 right, 1 up to connect 'door' and 'win', but that's already there: 'door is win'.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving right towards the door, hoping that by changing some rules on the way, I can pass. The latest observation shows that after moving right multiple times, the 'stop' rule has moved to 5 left, 1 up. Maybe I need to keep moving right to reach the door, and along the way, manipulate the rules.

Alternatively, the correct action is to move down towards the key or ball, pick them up, and use them. But again, no rules about using items.

Wait, in some levels, touching an object with the same property as 'you' wins. Since I'm 'you' and the door is 'win', touching the door should win. But I can't get past the wall blocking the door.

So the key must be to remove the 'stop' property from that wall. To do that, move the 'stop' rule to a different object. For example, move the 'stop' rule from the wall at 5 left, 1 up to the ball or key.

Assuming I can reach the 'stop' rule at 5 left, 1 up, I can push it next to the ball (1 left, 4 down) and an 'is' rule to make 'ball is stop', which would make the ball a stop, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule to the wall at 3 right, making 'wall is stop'—which it already is. That doesn't help.

Hmm. Maybe I need to create a rule that says 'stop is you', which would make whatever is stop now become you. But I don't have a 'you' rule next to a 'stop' rule.

Alternatively, 'baba is stop' would block me, which is bad.

This is really challenging. Let me try to think of a different approach. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes the wall passable by redefining 'stop'. For example, if there's a rule 'stop is win', then stops would be win, allowing me to pass. But how to create that.

To create 'stop is win', I need the 'stop', 'is', and 'win' text blocks adjacent. The 'win' is at 3 right, 1 up. 'Stop' is at 5 left, 1 up. 'Is' is at various places, like 7 right, 1 up. It's a bit far, but maybe possible.

If I can move the 'is' rule from 7 right, 1 up to somewhere between 'stop' and 'win', then push them together. Let's see:

- Current positions:
  - 'stop' rule: 5 left, 1 up
  - 'is' rule: 7 right, 1 up (wait, no, in the latest observation, the 'is' rules are at different positions. Let me check the latest observation:

In the last observation before the final one, the objects are:

rule `stop` 5 step to the left and 1 step up
wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up
rule `door` 1 step to the right and 1 step up
rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `wall` 7 step to the left
rule `is` 6 step to the left
wall 2 step to the left
door 3 steps to the right
...

So the 'is' rules are at 2 steps right, 1 up and 6 steps left, 1 up. The 'stop' is at 5 left, 1 up. The 'win' is at 3 right, 1 up.

So to make 'stop is win', I need to move 'is' between 'stop' and 'win'. The 'is' at 2 right, 1 up is closer to the win rule. If I can move that 'is' rule left to be adjacent to 'stop' at 5 left, then push it with 'stop' to make 'stop is ...', but where?

Alternatively, move the 'is' at 2 right, 1 up to be next to 'stop' at 5 left. To do that, I need to move left from 2 right to 5 left, but there are walls in the way. The wall at 1 left, 1 up is blocking the path.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'you' rule to Baba, but that's already done. Or push the 'win' rule onto Baba.

Alternatively, the answer is to move down towards the ball and use it to push a wall, but without a push rule, that's not","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get to the door because it's defined as win. But right now, I'm presumably controlled by Baba since ""baba is you"".

Looking at the map, there's a key at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something? But how do I get there? The walls are blocking the path. Let's see the objects again.

There's a rule `stop` 5 steps to the left and 1 step up. Walls are at various positions. The door is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. But right now, I'm not sure where I am exactly. The observation doesn't specify my position, just the objects on the map. Maybe I need to infer my location based on the objects.

Wait, the rules and walls are arranged in a grid. The `stop` rule is far to the left. The door is to the right. If I'm moving right towards the door, but there's a wall at 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I need to navigate around the walls. The key is down below, but there's a wall 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. How do I reach the key?

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can change ""door is win"" to something else, or make myself a key or a door. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The `is` rules are present. So, if I can move the ""win"" rule to associate with Baba, then I could turn myself into the win condition. 

Let me think. The current active rules are door is win and baba is you. So, to win, I need to reach the door. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I would win just by staying in place. But how to do that?

The `is` blocks are at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` at 4 steps to the left and 5 steps down, which is part of the ""you"" rule for Baba. To create a ""baba is win"" rule, I need to move the `win` text block next to `baba`. The `win` rule is currently at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that `win` block down to where the `baba` rule is, which is at 7 steps to the left and 5 steps down, then combining them would make ""baba is win"".

But to move the `win` block, I need to check if it's movable. The objects on the map list the `win` rule at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Are there any properties preventing me from moving it? The only immovable objects are those defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The `stop` rule is at 5 steps to the left and 1 step up, which is a different location. So, the `win` rule should be movable.

So the plan would be: move the `win` rule from its current position (3 right, 1 up) to the `baba` rule's location (7 left, 5 down). But how to navigate there, considering the walls?

Looking at the path, there are walls blocking the direct route. Maybe I need to move step by step, avoiding walls. Let's see:

From my current position (unknown, but assuming I'm near the `you` rule at 5 steps left and 5 down?), moving right towards the `win` rule. But there's a wall at 2 steps left and 1 up, which might be a STOP wall? No, the `stop` rule is at 5 left, 1 up. So maybe the walls are just normal walls that I can push if I'm a certain object.

Wait, the tips say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So, if an object is STOP, I can't move it. But in the current active rules, there's no ""STOP"" object; the `stop` rule is a text block that's probably part of a rule like ""X IS STOP"". But in the active rules, it's just ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the `stop` text block is floating, but unless there's a rule making something STOP, it's just a text block that can be moved.

Wait, the objects list includes a rule `stop` at 5 left, 1 up. But without an active rule like ""X IS STOP"", that `stop` text block is just a static rule that's not enforcing anything. So I can move it if needed.

So, to get to the `win` rule at 3 right, 1 up, I might need to move right. But there's a wall at 2 left, 1 up. If I'm to the right of that wall, I can move right. Let's assume my position is somewhere near the lower part where the `you` rule is. Let's see, the `you` rule is at 5 left, 5 down. The ball is at 1 left, 4 down. The key is at 1 left, 3 down.

Maybe I'm at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 7 left, 5 down. But that's where the `baba` rule is located, not my position. Wait, the player is controlled by Baba, so my position is where the Baba icon is. Looking at the objects, there's a `rule `baba` at 7 left, 5 down. But that's the text block, not my position. The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but perhaps I'm adjacent to the `baba` text block since ""baba is you"" makes me control it.

This is a bit confusing without knowing my exact position. Let's try to deduce it. The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects include various rules and walls. The key is at 1 left, 3 down. The door is at 3 right, 1 up. The `baba` rule is at 7 left, 5 down. If I'm at the `baba` rule's position, then to move towards the door, I need to go right, but there are walls blocking the way. Alternatively, to manipulate the rules, I need to reach the `win` text block and move it to the `baba` rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall if I'm a certain object. For example, if I'm made of wall, I can push it. But currently, I'm Baba, which is ""you"". So maybe I can push walls if they aren't STOP. Let's check the walls: there are walls at various positions, but none are marked as STOP unless the `stop` rule is applied. Since the active rules don't include anything making walls STOP, they can be moved if I am a pushable object. But as Baba, can I push walls?

In Baba Is You, typically, you can push objects if you are of a type that can push, like ice or certain other objects. Since the current rules don't specify any push rules, maybe I can't push walls unless there's a rule allowing it. But since ""baba is you"" and no other push rules, probably I can't push walls. So I need to find a path around them.

Looking at the current layout, from the `baba` rule at 7 left, 5 down, moving right would hit a wall at 2 left, 1 up, but that's up, not directly right. Wait, the walls are at different positions. The wall at 2 left, 1 up is diagonally up from the `baba` position. To move right from 7 left, 5 down, I can go towards 6 left, 5 down, then 5 left, 5 down, which is where the `you` rule is. But that's where I already am? Maybe I need to move down towards the key.

The key is at 1 left, 3 down. To get there from 7 left, 5 down, I need to move left and down. But there's a wall at 2 left, 3 down. So maybe I can go around it. Let's see:

From 7 left, 5 down: move left to 6 left, 5 down (no wall mentioned there), then left to 5 left, 5 down (which is the `you` rule), then down to 5 left, 4 down (wall there?), check the objects. There's a wall at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down (wall 1 left, 4 down). So moving left from 5 left, 5 down to 4 left, 5 down, then down to 4 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 2 left, 4 down. Wait, the objects list wall 2 left and 4 down. So if I'm at 4 left, 4 down, that's next to a wall. Can't move down further there.

This is getting complicated. Maybe instead of going for the key, I should focus on moving the `win` rule. The `win` rule is at 3 right, 1 up. To get there from where I am (assuming near the `baba` rule at 7 left, 5 down), I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. Let's see the path:

From 7 left, 5 down:

- Move right to 6 left, 5 down (no wall)
- Right to 5 left, 5 down (there's a `you` rule here, but that's okay)
- Right to 4 left, 5 down
- Right to 3 left, 5 down
- Right to 2 left, 5 down
- Right to 1 left, 5 down
- Right to 0 left, 5 down
But there's a wall at 2 left, 1 up, but that's up, not in this path. Continuing right:

At 0 left, 5 down, then up to 0 left, 4 down. There's a wall at 2 left, 4 down, but that's not in this direction. Wait, the walls listed are:

- wall 1 step up
- wall 2 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- etc.

So moving right from 7 left, 5 down towards the `win` rule at 3 right, 1 up, the path is blocked by walls at 2 left, 1 up and others. Maybe I need to find a different route, perhaps going down first.

From 7 left, 5 down, move down to 7 left, 4 down. Is there a wall there? The objects list wall 1 step to the left and 4 steps down (which would be 6 left, 4 down?), and wall 2 left, 4 down. So 7 left, 4 down is clear. Then move left to 6 left, 4 down (clear), 5 left, 4 down (wall there at 2 left, 4 down? No, that's 2 left, 4 down which is different). Wait, the walls at 4 steps down are:

- wall 2 step to the left and 4 steps down
- wall 1 step to the left and 4 steps down
- ball 4 steps down
- rule `key` 3 steps down

So at 4 steps down, there are walls at 1 left and 2 left. So if I'm at 5 left, 4 down, moving left would hit the wall at 2 left, 4 down. Hmm.

This is tricky. Maybe another approach: instead of moving physically, manipulate the rules. Since the goal is to reach the door which is win, but maybe I can change the win rule to Baba. To do that, I need to move the `win` text block next to the `baba` text block.

The `win` rule is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from its current position. Wait, no, the `win` rule's position is listed as 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I'm at the `baba` rule's position (7 left, 5 down), I need to move the `win` block from (3 right, 1 up) to (7 left, 5 down). That's a significant move. How?

First, I need to navigate to the `win` rule's current position. From 7 left, 5 down, moving up to 7 left, 4 down, then 7 left, 3 down, etc., but there are walls blocking. For example, at 1 step down from 7 left, 5 down is 7 left, 4 down (clear). Then 7 left, 3 down: is there a wall? The rule `key` is at 3 steps down, which is 7 left, 3 down? No, the `key` is at 1 left, 3 down. So 7 left, 3 down is clear. Then move up to the `win` rule's area.

The `win` rule is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from where? From its current position, which is listed as 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, the objects list says rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. No, looking back, in the current observation, the `win` rule is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, no, let me check the latest observation:

In the last observation before the current one, the `win` rule was at 5 steps to the left and 1 step up, but after some moves, it's now at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, no, the latest observation shows:

Active rules: door is win, baba is you

Objects on the map:
rule `stop` 5 step to the left and 1 step up
wall 2 step to the left and 1 step up
rule `door` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `is` 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
...

So the `win` rule is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. So to get there from my current position (assuming I'm at the `baba` rule's location, 7 left, 5 down), I need to move right and up. Let's calculate the coordinates.

If the `baba` rule is at 7 left, 5 down, then moving right would decrease the 'left' steps. So moving right 4 steps would get me to 3 left, 5 down. Then up 1 step to 3 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 2 left, 4 down. So if I'm at 3 left, 4 down, that's next to the wall at 2 left, 4 down. Can't move further up.

This is really complicated. Maybe the best bet is to move towards the `win` rule and see if I can grab it. But how to navigate around the walls. Alternatively, maybe I can use the `key` to unlock something, but I don't know how the key works here.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall if I'm of a certain type. But since I'm Baba (you), and there's no rule allowing pushing, probably not.

Another idea: since the `stop` rule is present, but not active, maybe I can create a ""stop is you"" rule to make myself stop, but that's counterproductive.

Wait, the tips mention that you can break apart existing rules or form new ones. So if I can move the `is` rule next to the `stop` rule to make ""stop is you"", but that would stop me. Not helpful.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving the `win` rule next to `baba`. The `win` rule is at 4 right, 1 up. The `baba` rule is at 7 left, 5 down. The distance is too big, but maybe there's a way to move the `win` rule step by step.

To move the `win` rule from 4 right, 1 up to 7 left, 5 down, I need to move it left and down. But each move of a text block requires being adjacent to it and then moving in a direction, possibly pushing other objects.

Assuming I can reach the `win` rule, here's the plan:

1. Navigate from my current position (probably near `baba` at 7 left, 5 down) to the `win` rule at 4 right, 1 up.
2. Once adjacent to the `win` rule, move it left and down towards the `baba` rule.
3. Place the `win` rule next to `baba` to create ""baba is win"", making me win by staying in place.

But the challenge is the path. Let's outline the steps:

Current position: Let's assume I'm at the `baba` rule's location: 7 left, 5 down.

Goal: Move `win` from 4 right, 1 up (which is 4 steps right and 1 step up from where?) Wait, the coordinate system is a bit confusing. In the game, positions are relative. For example, ""1 step up"" from a position would be that position minus 1 in the up direction, which might translate to a grid coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps all positions are relative to the player's position. But without knowing the player's exact location, it's hard to map.

Alternatively, consider that each object's position is described relative to the player. For example, ""rule `stop` 3 step to the left and 1 step up"" means 3 steps left and 1 up from the player's current position.

If that's the case, then the player's position is somewhere, and all other objects are positioned relative to them. But this complicates things further.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, perhaps I should try a simple action like moving right, assuming that eventually, by trial and error, I'll get closer to the `win` rule or find a way to manipulate it.

19,right,"<reasoning>
Let me see what's going on here. The active rules are door is win and baba is you. So, my goal is to reach the door, and since Baba is me, I need to get to the door where it's defined as win.

Looking at the objects, there's a door at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall in the way at 3 steps to the left and 1 step up, and the stop rule is 6 steps to the left and 1 step up. Wait, the stop rule means that whatever object it's attached to can't be moved. But right now, the stop rule is isolated; maybe I can move it?

Wait, the rules are ""stop"" at 6 steps left and 1 up, but there's no object specified for it to apply to. Maybe the stop rule is just floating? In Baba Is You, a rule like ""X IS STOP"" means X can't be moved. But if the rule is just ""STOP"" by itself, does it do anything? Maybe not. So perhaps the stop rule here is irrelevant because it's not attached to any subject.

The walls are vertical on the left side. To get to the door on the right, I need to navigate around the walls. But moving right directly would hit the wall at 3 steps left and 1 up. Wait, the door is at 2 steps right and 1 up. So maybe if I move up first?

But where am I currently? The problem is, I don't know my exact position. The observations list other objects but not my position. Hmm. Wait, in the game, you control Baba, so perhaps the ""baba is you"" rule indicates that I'm Baba. But where is Baba located on the map?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 8 steps left and 5 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"" rules. But that's a text block, not the actual Baba object. The actual Baba is probably represented by the position where the ""baba is you"" rule applies. Wait, maybe I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule? Or perhaps not. This is a bit confusing without knowing my starting position.

Alternatively, maybe the key here is to manipulate the rules. The door is the win condition, but maybe I can change what's win. For example, if I can make ""baba"" be ""win"", then reaching Baba would win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to be under ""baba"".

Looking at the current setup, the ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, attached to the door. The ""door is win"" rule is active. So the door is the win object. To change that, I need to rearrange the text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"", then ""baba is win"" would make reaching Baba the win condition.

But how do I move the text blocks? I can only move them if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left, 1 up. There's a wall at 3 left, 1 up. So maybe the stop rule is next to a wall, making that area immovable. But the ""win"" text block is at 2 right, 1 up. Let's see the positions:

- ""door"" is at 2 steps right, 1 up.
- ""is"" is at 1 step right, 1 up.
- ""win"" is at 2 steps right, 1 up. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, looking at the observation:

Objects on the map include:
rule `door` 1 step up
rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up

Wait, so the ""door"" rule is 1 step up (so vertical position?), ""is"" is 1 step right and 1 step up, and ""win"" is 2 steps right and 1 step up. So these text blocks are arranged horizontally? Maybe the game's coordinate system is a bit different. Assuming that moving right or left changes the horizontal position, and up/down changes the vertical.

So the ""door is win"" rule is formed by the ""door"" text block 1 step up, ""is"" 1 step right and 1 up, and ""win"" 2 steps right and 1 up. So to break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. But can I move them?

The ""stop"" rule is 6 steps to the left and 1 step up. There's a wall at 3 steps left and 1 up. So the area near the top left is blocked. But the text blocks for the door/win rule are on the right side. Let's see:

To alter the ""door is win"" rule, I need to move either ""door"", ""is"", or ""win"". If I can move the ""win"" text block to be under ""baba"", then I can make ""baba is win"". But where is ""baba"" located?

There's a rule `baba` at 8 steps left and 5 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"" at 7 left and 5 down, and ""you"" at 6 left and 5 down. So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed by the ""baba"" text block 8 left 5 down, ""is"" 7 left 5 down, and ""you"" 6 left 5 down. So to make ""baba is win"", I need to place the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" rule.

But how to get the ""win"" text block there? The current ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. To move it to the area where ""baba"" is (8 left 5 down), I would need to move left multiple steps and down. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 3 steps left and 1 step down, there's a wall. Then at 3 steps left and 2 down, another wall, etc., down to 3 steps left and 4 down, wall, and 1 step left and 4 down is the key, then ball at 2 left 4 down.

This seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall or use the key to unlock something. But there's a key at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to move a wall. But how?

Wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes keys can be used with ""push"" rules, but by default, you can only move objects that aren't stopped. The walls are stopped unless there's a ""push"" rule or similar. But the current rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I can move any object that isn't stopped. Let's check which objects are stopped.

The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left 1 up, but it's not attached to any subject. So it doesn't stop anything. The walls are just present; they're objects but not stopped unless there's a ""stop"" rule attached to them. So maybe the walls are movable? But in the game, walls are usually stopped unless there's a rule like ""wall is push"" or something. But here, the only active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So walls might be movable. Wait, no, typically walls are stopped unless specified otherwise. But if there's no ""wall is stop"" rule, then they can be moved. Wait, checking the objects:

There's a rule `wall` at 5 step to the left, which is probably ""wall is ..."", but the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the ""wall"" rule is just a text block, not part of an active rule. So maybe the walls are just regular objects that can be moved if they're not stopped. But there's no ""stop"" rule attached to them, so they can be moved.

But moving walls might not help unless I can use them to block or unblock paths. Let's think about the path to the door. The door is at 2 right 1 up. To get there, I need to go right, but there's a wall at 3 left 1 up. Wait, maybe my position is somewhere in the middle. This is tricky without knowing where I am.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball or key to somewhere. The ball is at 2 left 4 down. The key is at 1 left 3 down. If I can get the key and use it to unlock a door, but there's no locked door here. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba"".

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. It's currently at 2 right 1 up. To get it to the area of ""baba"" which is 8 left 5 down, I need to move left 4 steps and down 4 steps. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, from 2 right 1 up, moving left would hit the wall at 3 left 1 up (since the wall is at 3 left 1 up). So I can't go directly left. Maybe move down first?

If I move down from the ""win"" text block (2 right 1 up), there's a wall at 3 left 3 down. Wait, the walls are at 3 left 1 down, 2 down, 3 down, etc. So moving down from the ""win"" block (2 right 1 up) would take me to 2 right 2 up, but there's no wall there. Wait, the walls are at 3 left and 1, 2, 3, 4 steps down. So if I'm at 2 right 1 up, moving down to 2 right 2 up is possible. Then maybe move left around the walls.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Since I'm Baba, and the goal is to reach the door, which is win. But the door is behind walls. Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba the win by changing the rule. So if I can create ""baba is win"", then standing on Baba would win.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" text block. The ""baba"" text block is at 8 left 5 down. The ""win"" text block is at 2 right 1 up. These are on opposite sides of the map. To move the ""win"" block to the ""baba"" area, I need to move it left 10 steps and down 4 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, moving left from 2 right 1 up would go through 1 right, then 0, then -1 (left), but there's a wall at 3 left 1 up, which is to the left of the current position. So moving left from 2 right 1 up would hit the wall at 3 left 1 up if I'm positioned at 1 right 1 up. Wait, maybe my position is different.

This is really confusing without knowing my starting position. Alternatively, maybe the initial position is near the ""baba"" rule. If I'm at the position of the ""baba"" text block (8 left 5 down), then to reach the ""win"" text block (2 right 1 up), I need to move right and up, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is involved. The key is at 1 left 3 down. If I can get the key and move it somewhere, but I don't see a locked door. Maybe the key is a red herring.

Another idea: since the door is the win condition, maybe I can push a wall to create a path. But walls are movable if they're not stopped. The walls here are probably movable. For example, if I can move the wall at 3 left 1 up out of the way, I could go right to the door. But how to move that wall? I would need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since I'm Baba, and if walls can be moved (no stop rule), then I could push the wall.

Assuming I'm near the wall at 3 left 1 up. If I move right into it, I could push it left. But where would it go? If I push it left, it would move to 2 left 1 up, potentially creating a path. But I need to know my position to do that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm at the position of the ""you"" rule, which is 3 left 5 down. From there, moving up might be possible. But there's a wall at 3 left 1 down, etc.

This is really challenging without knowing my exact location. Let's try to piece it together. The ""baba is you"" rule is made up of the text blocks at 8 left 5 down (baba), 7 left 5 down (is), and 6 left 5 down (you). So if I'm at the ""baba"" text block's position, I can move around. But how do I interact with the other text blocks?

To change a rule, I need to move one of the text blocks in the rule. For example, to break ""door is win"", I can move the ""win"" block away. But to create a new rule like ""baba is win"", I need to place ""win"" next to ""baba"".

The ""win"" block is currently at 2 right 1 up. To get it to 8 left 5 down, I need to move it left 10 steps and down 4 steps. That's a lot, and the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the key is at 1 left 3 down. If I can get the key and use it to move a wall, but I don't know how keys work here. Maybe there's a ""key is push"" rule, but there isn't one active.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall at 3 left 1 up to create a path. If I'm next to that wall and move it, perhaps I can clear a path to the door. Let's say I'm at 2 left 1 up (near the door rule). If I move right into the wall at 3 left 1 up, pushing it left to 2 left 1 up, then I could move right past it. But I need to confirm if that's possible.

Assuming I can push the wall, moving right from my position (assuming I'm at 1 left 1 up) into the wall at 3 left 1 up might not be possible because the wall is further left. This is getting too vague without knowing my exact spot.

Another approach: since the door is win, and I'm Baba, maybe I can just walk towards the door, pushing any movable walls out of the way. If the walls are movable, I can push them. For example, if I'm next to the wall at 3 left 1 up and move left, I could push it further left, creating a path. But again, this requires knowing my position.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba"". To do that, I need to grab the ""win"" text block (which is at 2 right 1 up) and move it to the area of ""baba"" (8 left 5 down). The path between these two points is blocked by walls, but perhaps there's a way around.

From 2 right 1 up, moving down to 2 right 2 up, then left through the key area. The key is at 1 left 3 down. So moving down from 2 right 2 up to 2 right 3 down, then left to 1 right 3 down (where the key is), then left to 0 right 3 down, but there's a wall at 3 left 3 down. Wait, the walls are at 3 left and 1, 2, 3, 4 down. So moving left from 1 right 3 down would go to 0 right 3 down, which is next to the wall at 3 left 3 down? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinates are relative.

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first, grab it, and then use it to move a wall. But I don't know if that's necessary.

Alternatively, think of the simplest solution: move right towards the door, pushing walls if possible. If the wall at 3 left 1 up can be pushed, then moving right into it would clear the path. But I need to be adjacent to it.

Wait, the ""door"" is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The wall is at 3 left and 1 up. So if I'm at 1 left and 1 up, I could move right into the wall at 3 left 1 up, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe the positions are structured differently.

I think I'm stuck here. The key insight must be to manipulate the rules by moving the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"". To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" block, move it, and place it near ""baba"". Given the obstacles, the path would require moving through various areas, possibly using the key to unlock something, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: since the ""key"" is present, maybe using the key to activate a rule. For example, if there's a ""key is unlock"" rule, but there isn't one here. The active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"".

Wait, maybe the ball is involved. The ball is at 2 left 4 down. If I can move the ball into a certain position, but I don't see a rule that affects balls.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make a guess. The most straightforward action might be to move right towards the door, hoping that the walls can be pushed out of the way. So I'll choose ""right"" as the action.

20,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. So, in Baba Is You, the goal is usually to get to the door, which is set as ""win"". Right now, the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means if I can reach the door, I win, and since I'm Baba, I can move around unless something stops me.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `stop`"" way to the left and up. Then there are walls lining up on the left side, getting closer each time. The door is to the right and up, but there's a wall blocking the path directly. The ""key"" is somewhere below, and there's a ""ball"" further down. But I don't know if the key is needed here.

The ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" are way to the left and down, which might not be relevant right now. The walls are getting denser as we go down. The ball is at 3 steps left and 4 steps down. Maybe that's a distraction.

My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm starting at the default position, maybe near the ""baba"" rule that's at 9 steps left and 5 steps down. Wait, no, the ""baba"" rule is part of the static setup. I think I'm the Baba entity, so maybe I'm located where the ""baba"" text block is? Or perhaps I'm somewhere else. The problem is, the observations don't tell me my exact position, just the positions of other objects.

But the active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"", so I can move unless there's a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is 7 steps to the left and 1 step up. So if I go left towards that stop rule, I might be stopped. The walls are also on the left, so moving left might not help.

The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 4 steps left and 1 step up. So maybe I need to get past that wall. How? Well, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" to make ""wall is stop"" or something else, that might make the walls passable.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I can pick up that ""is"" rule and move it next to the ""wall"" rule, I could change its property. Let's see: the ""wall"" rule is at 9 steps left. If I move the ""is"" from 1 step up to be next to the ""wall"" rule (which is at 9 left), then combining them would make ""wall is [something]"". But where is the ""is"" rule located? The ""is"" at 1 step up is probably near the top. If I can move that ""is"" to the ""wall"" rule's position, changing it to ""wall is stop"" or ""wall is you"", that might help.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba immune to stops. For example, if I can make ""baba is not stop"" by moving text blocks. But to do that, I need to find the ""not"" rule or create it. Wait, I don't see a ""not"" rule in the current objects. Hmm.

Another approach: the door is the win condition, but it's protected by a wall. If I can make the wall into a stop, then maybe I can push past it? Or if I can make myself a key or something that can open the door. But the door is a win, so maybe I need to change the door's rule. For instance, making ""door is you"", which would let me walk through it. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" next to the door.

The door is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, same level as the door. So if I can move that ""is"" to be next to the door, then I can say ""door is [something]"". If I make it ""door is you"", then since I'm Baba and you, I could enter the door. But how do I move that ""is"" rule?

The problem is that most objects are either walls or rules that are several steps away. I need to see if there's a path to reach those rules. The ""key"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. Maybe picking up the key first would help, but I don't know if the key does anything here. The ball is further down, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push the walls if they're not stopped. Wait, the walls are defined by ""wall is [property]"". If the wall's rule is ""wall is stop"", then they're immovable. But if the rule is just ""wall"", then maybe they can be pushed. But the current active rule is ""wall"" at 9 steps left, so probably it's ""wall is stop"" because there's a ""rule `wall`"" there. So those walls are stopping.

So, the main obstacles are the walls blocking the path to the door. To get past them, I need to change their rules. Let's focus on the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule (9 left), then I can change what the wall does. For example, moving ""is"" to make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", but I need to have the ""push"" or ""you"" text block elsewhere.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 7 steps left and 5 steps down. That's quite far. To get there, I'd have to navigate through the walls, but they're all the way on the left. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, is there a way to make the stop rule not apply to me? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", if I can make ""you is not stop"", that would let me move through stop blocks. But to do that, I need the ""not"" rule. Do I have that? The current rules don't mention ""not"", so I can't create it unless there's a text block for it.

Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `stop`"", ""rule `door`"", ""rule `is`"", ""rule `win`"", ""rule `wall`"", ""rule `baba`"", ""rule `you`"", and ""rule `key`"". No ""not"" rule. So I can't use ""not"" unless I find a way to create it, which I can't here.

Another idea: Maybe I can use the key. The key is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can pick up the key and move it somewhere, but I don't know if the key has any effect unless there's a rule about it. The current active rules don't mention the key, so maybe it's just a collectible. But since the goal is the door, maybe the key is a red herring.

Back to the main problem. The door is behind walls. To get there, I need to either remove the walls, make them passable, or change the door's rule to let me through. Let's try changing the door's rule. The door is at 1 step left and 1 step up. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, same horizontal level. If I can move that ""is"" next to the door, I can change its property. For example, making ""door is you"", which would let me enter it.

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. But the ""is"" is at 1 step up. My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm near the bottom right where the door is eventually, maybe I need to move up. However, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move past that wall, perhaps by changing its rule.

Wait, the wall at 4 steps left and 1 step up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, since there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 9 steps left. So that wall is stopping. If I can change the wall's rule to something else, like ""wall is push"", then maybe I can push it out of the way. But to do that, I need to get the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" all the way to the ""wall"" at 9 steps left, that would take several moves. But each move would require being adjacent and pushing. Given that the map is getting denser on the left, navigating there might be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see: the door is at 1 left, 1 up. The ""is"" is at 1 up. If I can move right towards the door, but there's a wall at 4 left, 1 up. So maybe I need to go around the walls. But the walls are on the left, so moving right might be possible.

Wait, the current active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I can move freely unless there's a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 1 up. If I move towards the door (1 left, 1 up), but there's a wall at 4 left, 1 up. That wall is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So I can't pass through it. Therefore, I need to find a way to remove that wall's stop property.

To do that, I need to modify the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 9 left. If I can move the ""is"" rule (which is at 1 up) to be next to the ""wall"" rule (9 left), then I can change what the wall does. For example, making ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"".

But moving the ""is"" from 1 up to 9 left would require moving it 8 steps to the left. Each move would need to be possible, avoiding other walls. The path from 1 up to 9 left is blocked by walls at 4 left, 1 up and others. So maybe I need to find another route.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to make the stop rule not apply to me. Since I'm Baba, if I can make ""baba is not stop"", that would let me move through stops. But how? I would need the ""not"" rule, which I don't have. The available rules don't include ""not"".

Another angle: the ""rule `you`"" is at 7 left, 5 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" into ""you is win"", then touching the you rule might make me win. But the active rule is ""baba is you"", so I am you. The door is win, so if I can reach the door, I win. But the door is blocked.

Wait, maybe I can push the door? If the door is a win, but it's behind a wall. If I can make the door's rule something else, like ""door is push"", then I could push it out of the way. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" next to the door.

The door is at 1 left, 1 up. The ""is"" is at 1 up. If I can move the ""is"" to be next to the door, then I can say ""door is [something]"". For example, making it ""door is push"" so I can push it. But how do I get the ""is"" there?

The ""is"" is at 1 step up, same horizontal level as the door but 1 step to the right. So to move the ""is"" left by 1 step to be next to the door, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. But where am I located? If I'm starting near the bottom right, maybe I need to move up first.

Assuming I'm near the bottom right, moving up would take me towards the door. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule leftwards by using the available space. The ""is"" is at 1 up. To the left of it, there's a wall at 4 left, 1 up. So I can't move left past that wall. Unless I change the wall's rule.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the door (win).
- Obstacle: Walls blocking the path.
- Tools: Can move text blocks unless they're stop.
- Available rules: door is win, baba is you.
- Key objects: stop rule at 7 left,1 up; wall rules; is rules; door; etc.

Possible solution steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule (at 1 up) next to the ""wall"" rule (9 left) to change the wall's property.
2. Alternatively, move the ""is"" next to the door (1 left,1 up) to change the door's property to let me through.

But how to physically move the ""is"" rule?

Assuming I'm positioned to the right of the ""is"" rule at 1 up. If I move left towards it, but there's a wall at 4 left,1 up. So I need to go around that wall. Maybe by moving down and then left, but the walls below are also present.

Alternatively, find a path to the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at 1 step up. If I move up from my current position (unknown), but there's a wall at 4 left,1 up. Unless I can move around that wall by going down first.

This is tricky without knowing my exact position. Maybe the key is to focus on the ""is"" rule near the door. The ""is"" is at 1 step up, same as the door. If I can move that ""is"" left by one step to be next to the door, then I can change the door's rule. For example, making it ""door is you"", which I already am, but that might not help. Or ""door is push"".

Wait, if I make the door ""door is push"", then maybe I can push it out of the way. But how would that help me reach it? I'm not sure. Alternatively, making the door ""door is win"" is already the case, so that's not useful.

Another thought: If I can make ""baba is win"", then I would automatically win wherever I am. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"". The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right,1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left,5 down. That's a long way apart. Not feasible.

Alternatively, pick up the ""win"" rule and move it to ""baba"". But the path is blocked by walls.

This seems really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" to change its property. Let's try that.

The ""is"" is at 1 step up. The door is at 1 left,1 up. So the ""is"" is to the right of the door. If I can move the ""is"" left by one step to be adjacent to the door, then I can write ""door is [something]"". For example, making it ""door is you"", but I'm already you. Or ""door is push"".

To move the ""is"" left, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Assuming I'm to the right of the ""is"", which is at 1 up. If I move left, but there's a wall at 4 left,1 up. So I can't go left past that wall. Unless I can move the wall first.

To move the wall, I need to change its rule. The wall's rule is at 9 left. So I need to get the ""is"" there. This seems like a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's look at the current setup again.

Active rules:
door is win
baba is you

Objects:
- rule `stop` 7 left,1 up
- wall 4 left,1 up
- rule `door` 2 right,1 up
- rule `is` 3 right,1 up
- rule `win` 4 right,1 up
- rule `wall` 9 left
- etc.

The door is at 2 right,1 up. The ""is"" is at 3 right,1 up. So the ""is"" is to the right of the door. To get the ""is"" next to the door, I need to move it left by one step. That would require being adjacent to the ""is"" and pushing it left.

Assuming I'm positioned to the right of the ""is"", which is at 3 right,1 up. If I move left, I would push the ""is"" to 2 right,1 up, making it adjacent to the door. Then the rule would become ""door is [whatever was next to the 'is']"". Wait, the ""is"" is a text block that says ""is"", so combining it with the door would make ""door is [something]"". But what's next to the ""is"" after moving?

If I move the ""is"" left to be next to the door, then the rule would be ""door is [the property after 'is']"". But the 'is' is a separate text block. Wait, in Baba Is You, when you have ""X IS Y"", the 'is' connects X and Y. So if you have ""door IS [something]"", you need to have the 'is' next to both the door and the property.

So, if I move the ""is"" rule to be between the door and another property, like ""push"" or ""you"", then it would create the new rule. But in the current setup, the ""is"" is at 3 right,1 up. If I move it left to be next to the door (2 right,1 up), then the rule would be ""door IS [whatever is next to the 'is']"". But there's nothing else next to it except maybe the ""win"" rule at 4 right,1 up.

Wait, after moving the ""is"" to 2 right,1 up (next to the door at 1 left,1 up?), no. The door is at 2 right,1 up. The ""is"" is at 3 right,1 up. So moving the ""is"" left by one step would place it at 2 right,1 up, adjacent","

21,right,"<reasoning>
The active rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, I need to get to the door to win. But how?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""stop"" 7 steps to the left and 1 up. But since Baba is You, maybe I can move other objects. Wait, the walls are either standalone or part of the ""wall"" rule. The rule ""wall"" is at 9 steps left, so maybe that's making those walls immovable? But I can move other text blocks if they're not stopped.

There's a key at 3 steps left and 3 down. Do I need that? The door is on the right, but there are walls blocking the path. The key might be to unlock a door, but there's no lock mentioned. Maybe the key is a red herring.

Looking at the lower part: there's a ball at 3 left and 4 down. Not sure. The Baba rule is at 9 left and 5 down. Maybe I need to move that to make Baba something else?

Wait, to change the rules, I need to move a ""is"" text block. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""door is stop"", that would change things. But right now, the rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"".

The door is 1 step to the right and 1 up. But there's a wall 4 steps left and 1 up. So moving up might be blocked. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make walls movable or create a path.

The ""stop"" rule is 7 left and 1 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can move walls. But how? To move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a STOP. Since Baba is You, and assuming I'm Baba, I need to move.

Wait, where am I currently located? The observation doesn't specify my position. That's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to plan. Maybe the initial position is assumed, but in the problem description, the user hasn't provided that. This complicates things.

Assuming I start somewhere, perhaps near the bottom right? Let's see. The door is 1 step to the right and up. But there's a wall there. Maybe I need to move the ""door is win"" rule to change what the door does. For example, if I make ""door is stop"", then the door becomes a wall. But how to do that?

To change a rule, I need to take an ""is"" block and combine it with the subject and property. For instance, if I have ""baba is you"" and I want to change it to ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win"". But the current ""is"" blocks are in specific positions.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""is"" at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", that would make ""baba is win"", which would make me win if I reach Baba. But where is the ""baba"" text block? It's at 9 left and 5 down. So I need to move the ""is"" from 1 step up to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"".

But first, I need to navigate to those positions. The problem is that there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at various positions, making movement difficult. Maybe I can use the ""key"" to unlock something, but there's no lock. Alternatively, create a rule that makes walls movable.

Alternatively, make ""wall is stop"", which would make walls immovable, but that's already the case. Wait, the existing rules are ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""wall"" rule is separate. Maybe the walls are defined by the ""wall is stop"" rule elsewhere, but in the current active rules, it's just ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the walls are just obstacles.

So, to move through walls, I need to either change the rule so that walls are not STOP, or find a way to bypass them. But since ""baba is you"", and I can move if the object I'm on isn't STOP. So if I can move to a non-STOP object, I can proceed.

Looking at the map, the lower part has a ball at 3 left and 4 down. Maybe pushing the ball could help? But I don't know if the ball has any rules. Similarly, the key might be useful if there's a lock, but there isn't one.

Another approach: since the door is the win condition, maybe I need to reach it by moving around the walls. But the path is blocked. Let's see the structure:

From the current observation, the door is at 1 step to the right and up. But there's a wall at 4 left and 1 up. So maybe moving up isn't possible. Alternatively, moving right past the walls.

Wait, the walls are at 4 left and 1 up, then 1 step to the left and 1 up (door), then rule ""is"" and ""win"". The door is 1 step to the right and 1 up from the ""is"" rule. So the door's position is 1 right and 1 up from the ""is"" at 1 step up.

But to get there, I need to navigate around the walls on the left. Maybe moving right step by step, avoiding the walls. But how?

If I'm starting near the bottom right, moving right would take me towards the door. But there are walls at 4 left and 1 up, etc. Alternatively, maybe there's a path down below.

Looking at the lower walls: 4 left and 1 down, 2 down, 3 down. Then key at 3 left and 3 down, wall at 4 left and 4 down, ball at 3 left and 4 down. The rule ""baba"" is at 9 left and 5 down, which is far to the left.

This is getting complicated. Without knowing my starting position, it's hard to plan. Maybe the initial position is implied, but since it's not given, I have to assume.

Alternatively, perhaps the strategy is to move the ""is"" text block to change a rule. For example, take the ""is"" at 1 step up and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". That way, reaching Baba (which is me) would make me win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" from 1 step up to connect with ""baba"" at 9 left and 5 down and ""win"" at 2 right and 1 up. That would require moving the ""is"" block through the map, avoiding walls.

Alternatively, move the ""door is win"" rule to somewhere else. For example, change ""door is win"" to ""wall is win"", making walls the win condition. Then push walls to reach them.

But how to do that? I would need to take the ""is"" from the ""door is win"" rule and rearrange it.

This is quite complex. Given the time constraints, maybe the best immediate action is to move right to try to get closer to the door or the key. But considering the walls, perhaps moving right step by step is possible.

Looking at the latest observation, after several right moves, the ""stop"" rule is moving further left. So each time I move right, the environment shifts? Or is it that the player's movement affects the rules? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the ball or key to a certain position. But without knowing the rules of the key or ball, it's hard to say.

Another angle: since ""baba is you"", I can move any object that's not STOP. So if I can move the ""is"" text blocks to create new rules, that would change the game. For example, moving ""is"" to make ""baba is win"", then I just need to reach myself.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""baba"" text block at 9 left and 5 down, bring an ""is"" and ""win"" there. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the walls by changing their rules.

Alternatively, make ""wall is you"", then I can push walls. But that would require rearranging the ""wall is stop"" rule. But where is the original ""wall is stop"" rule? In the current active rules, it's not listed. Only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the walls might be defined elsewhere, but not in the active rules. Wait, the objects list has ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left"" and others, but those are inactive rules, right? Because active rules are only ""door is win"" and ""baba is you"".

So the walls on the map are probably instances of the ""wall"" object, which is defined by some rule elsewhere, but since the active rule isn't ""wall is [something]"", their behavior depends on default rules. In Baba Is You, if an object's rule is not defined, it might have default properties. For example, walls are usually STOP unless otherwise specified.

So, the walls are STOP, meaning I can't push them or move through them. Therefore, to get past them, I need to either change their rule (e.g., make them not STOP) or find a way around.

Given that, perhaps the solution is to change the ""wall"" rule. For example, create ""wall is you"", which would let me push walls. To do that, I need to find the ""wall"" rule (which is at 5 step to the left) and rearrange it.

The ""wall"" rule is a text block saying ""WALL IS ..."". Wait, in the objects list, there's ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left"", which means the text block ""WALL IS"" is at that position. To change it, I need to take the ""is"" from another rule and attach it to ""wall"" and a new property.

For example, if I move the ""is"" from the ""door is win"" rule to make ""wall is you"", then walls would become pushable. Then I could push them out of the way.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""wall"" rule at 5 left, take the ""is"" from somewhere else (like the ""door is win"" rule which is at 3 steps right and 1 up), and replace it.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the ""door is win"" rule (position: rule `door` 3 steps to the right and 1 step up).
2. Take the ""is"" from there and move it to the ""wall"" rule, combining to make ""wall is you"".
3. Then, walls become pushable, and I can move them aside to reach the door.

But how to navigate there? The current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm starting near the bottom right, moving right and up might be necessary.

Alternatively, another approach: create a ""you"" rule for another object, like the ball, and then move the ball to the door. But that's risky.

Alternatively, make the door a pushable object by changing its rule. For example, ""door is you"", then I can push the door. But the door is the win condition, so if I push it somewhere else, maybe that's not helpful.

This is quite challenging without knowing the exact map layout and starting position. Given the observations provided, after several right moves, the ""stop"" rule is moving further left. Perhaps the solution is to keep moving right to get to the area where the ""baba"" text block is, to change the rule to ""baba is win"".

So, the next action should be to move right again to continue towards the ""baba"" rule.
