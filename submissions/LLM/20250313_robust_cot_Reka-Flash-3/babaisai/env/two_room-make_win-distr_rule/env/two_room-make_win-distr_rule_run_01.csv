Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach a ""WIN"" object, but the rules might be different here. Let me look at the current active rules and the objects on the map.

The active rule right now is ""baba is you"". That means I can move Baba (assuming I'm controlling Baba) using the movement actions. Other objects like ball, wall, door, etc., might have different properties based on other rules, but right now only ""baba is you"" is active. The rest of the rules are text blocks on the map that I can potentially rearrange to change the game rules.

Looking at the objects:

There's a ""ball"" 1 step right and 2 up. A ""wall"" at 4 right, 2 up. Then there's a rule ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up, a ""win"" rule at 9 right, 2 up. Below that, there's a ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 up, another ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 down, a ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 1 down, another wall, a ""door"" rule at 8 right, 1 down, more walls, and a ""ball"" rule at 8 right, 2 down. Also, there's a ""baba"" rule at 1 left and 4 down, an ""is"" rule there, and a ""you"" rule at 1 right, 4 down.

My goal is probably to get to the ""win"" object, but maybe that's not the case if I can change the rules. Let me think. The ""win"" rule is on the map, so if I can make myself ""win"", then touching it would win the level. But how?

First, I need to move the text blocks to create new rules. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move around, but can I push the rules? Wait, the tips say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So I need to check if any of the movable objects are not STOP.

Looking at the objects: the walls are probably STOP unless there's a rule saying otherwise. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. So if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls are stop. But in the active rules listed, the only active one is ""baba is you"". The other rules are on the map but not active yet.

So, to move other objects, like the rules or the walls, they need to not have a STOP property. But since the walls are at 4 right positions, maybe they are walls because of a rule like ""wall is wall"" or something. Wait, there's a rule ""wall"" at 1 left, 1 up. That might mean ""wall is [something]"". Let me check the positions again.

The rules on the map are:

- rule `is` at 8 right, 2 up

- rule `win` at 9 right, 2 up

- rule `wall` at 1 left, 1 up

- rule `is` at 1 up

- rule `stop` at 3 right, 1 down

- rule `door` at 8 right, 1 down

- rule `ball` at 8 right, 2 down

- rule `baba` at 1 left, 4 down

- rule `is` at 4 down

- rule `you` at 1 right, 4 down

So the active rules are only ""baba is you"". All other rules are inactive because they need to be combined with an ""IS"" rule to form an active rule. For example, ""wall IS stop"" would be formed by moving the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then the ""stop"" rule. But right now, those rules are separate.

My plan is to create new rules by moving these text blocks. The key is to either make myself (Baba) into Win, or make the Win condition easier to reach. Let me see.

First, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up. To reach that, I need to get there, but there are walls blocking the way. The walls at 4 right, 2 up and 4 right, 1 up. Also, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down, which might make moving through that area impossible.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the property of Baba to be able to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"" or ""baba is win"", but that would require creating those rules.

Looking at the available rules:

At 8 right, 2 up is the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is next to it at 9 right, 2 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule, then maybe combine them. But how?

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move around. My position isn't specified, but the objects are located at various positions. The ball is 1 right and 2 up from me (assuming I'm Baba, but the exact position isn't given in the observation. Wait, the observation lists the objects relative to Baba? Or are all positions given relative to some origin?)

Hmm, the problem is that the observation's positions are described relative to each other but not to Baba's position. That might complicate things. Without knowing where Baba is located on the grid, it's hard to plan the exact movements. But perhaps the key is to look for the rules and see how to rearrange them.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to move the ""win"" rule next to an ""is"" rule to activate it as a new rule. For example, if I can place ""win IS ..."" then it would create a new rule. But the current active rules don't have that.

Wait, there's a ""you"" rule at 1 right, 4 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" by moving the ""you"" rule next to Baba's rule. Wait, there's a ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 4 down, an ""is"" rule at 4 down, and a ""you"" rule at 1 right, 4 down. So if I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" rule, that would create ""baba is you"", but that's already the active rule. So maybe that's not necessary.

Alternatively, to make ""baba is win"", I need to combine the ""baba"" rule with the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 4 down. So if I can arrange them in order: baba, is, win. That would make ""baba is win"", meaning that touching Baba would make him a win, so if I can get to the win object, that would complete the level.

But how to move those rules? Let's see the positions:

- rule `baba`: 1 left, 4 down

- rule `is`: 4 down

- rule `you`: 1 right, 4 down

So they are all in the same row (4 down), with ""baba"" to the left, then ""is"" in the middle, then ""you"" to the right. To make ""baba is win"", I need to replace the ""you"" with ""win"". But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up. That's quite far away. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down to the 4 down row.

But how to move it? To move a rule, I need to push it using another object or text block that's not STOP. The walls are at 4 right positions, which might be STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down, so maybe walls are STOP. So I can't push walls.

Looking at the other rules: the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up, the ""win"" rule at 9 right, 2 up. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down by pushing it with other blocks. But again, unless there's a way to move them without hitting STOP.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a ""push"" rule. If I can make ""baba is push"", then I could push other blocks. But to do that, I need the ""push"" rule. But there's no ""push"" rule on the map. The available rules are is, win, wall, stop, door, ball, baba, you.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule at 8 right, 1 down. Maybe combining that with other rules. But I'm not sure.

Let me think again. The immediate goal is probably to reach the ""win"" object, but it's blocked by walls. The walls are at 4 right, 2 up and 1 up. Maybe if I can change the property of the walls to not be STOP, then I can move through them. For example, if I make ""wall is you"", then walls would be controllable. But to do that, I need to rearrange the ""wall"" rule with the ""is"" and ""you"" rules.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. There's another ""is"" rule at 1 up. So if I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and then ""you"", that would create ""wall is you"". Then walls would be you, meaning I can move them. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is push"" to push walls. But again, no ""push"" rule.

Wait, another approach: the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that area, perhaps by moving the ""stop"" rule away. But to move it, I need to have a way to push it. Since walls are likely STOP, I can't push them. Maybe the ""door"" rule can be used somehow.

Alternatively, the ""door"" is a rule at 8 right, 1 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then the door could be the win condition. But again, need to rearrange the rules.

Wait, the key might be to make myself (Baba) the Win. So if I can create the rule ""baba is win"", that would mean touching Baba makes him win. So I need to arrange the ""baba"", ""is"", ""win"" rules in sequence.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up. That's quite far. So I need to move the ""win"" rule down to the 4 down row. But how?

Perhaps there's a way to move the ""win"" rule by using other movable objects. Let's see. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. Maybe combine ""win"" with ""is"" there. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up, then they would form ""win is ..."", but there's nothing after that. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the 9 right, 2 up position next to ""win"".

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up. So if I can push the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be next to ""win"", forming ""win is"". But that doesn't do anything. Or if I can move the ""win"" rule left to be next to the ""is"" rule, forming ""win is"", but that's not a valid rule.

Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule to the 4 down row. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down, ""is"" at 4 down, and ""you"" at 1 right, 4 down. If I can replace the ""you"" with ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be active. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up, which is a long distance away.

To move the ""win"" rule down, I might need to use other rules as a bridge. For example, move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 2 up to 7 right, 2 up, then 6, etc., but that would require pushing it left past other objects. However, there's a wall at 4 right, 2 up and 1 up, which might be blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe use the ""door"" rule at 8 right, 1 down. If I can create a rule like ""door is push"", then maybe doors can be pushed. But again, I don't have a ""push"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""win"" rule to the area where the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules are located (4 down row). This would allow creating ""baba is win"".

2. To move the ""win"" rule, need to push it using other non-STOP objects. The ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up could be moved leftwards, possibly pushing the ""win"" rule? But the ""is"" rule is separate from the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 2 up, ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up. So if I move the ""is"" rule right to 9 right, 2 up, it would be next to ""win"", forming ""win is ..."", but there's nothing else. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule left by pushing it with the ""is"" rule. But the ""win"" is to the right of the ""is"", so moving the ""is"" right would be next to ""win"", but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, find a way to get to the 4 down row. Maybe move vertically. If I can move down from my current position (assuming I'm somewhere above), but without knowing my position, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the key is to first create a ""push"" ability. For example, make ""baba is push"". To do that, I need the ""push"" rule. But there's no ""push"" text block. Alternatively, use existing rules. Maybe ""baba is move"" or something, but that's not there.

Alternatively, use the ""door"" rule. If I can make ""door is push"", then maybe pushing doors would allow moving other objects. Not sure.

Another approach: The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that area, perhaps by moving the ""stop"" rule away. But how? To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to push it with something. The walls around it might be STOP, so I can't push them.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""stop is nothing"", but there's no ""nothing"" rule.

Hmm. Maybe I need to create a rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"". But to do that, I need to negate the ""stop"" property. However, in Baba Is You, you can't directly negate rules; you have to replace them. So if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule (which there might be), I could change it to ""wall is you"" or something else.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. So combining that with the ""is"" rule at 1 up and a ""you"" rule... Wait, the ""is"" rule at 1 up is separate. If I can move the ""wall"" rule next to ""is"" and then a ""you"" rule, it would make ""wall is you"", making walls movable. Then I could push walls out of the way.

Let's see: the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 up (same position as the ""is"" rule mentioned earlier?). Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules are on the map at various positions. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. There's another ""is"" rule at 1 up. So if I can move the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and then a ""you"" rule, but where is the ""you"" rule?

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 4 down. That's quite far from the 1 left, 1 up position. So maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, use the ""you"" rule that's already in the active rule ""baba is you"". But that's part of the active rule and can't be moved individually.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's think differently. The ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 1 down. If I can make a rule like ""door is key"" or ""door is win"", but I don't have those rules. Alternatively, ""baba is door"", which would make me a door, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, create ""win is you"", making whatever is YOU the win condition. But the current ""you"" is part of ""baba is you"". If I can change ""you"" to ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be active. But how?

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 4 down. If I can replace it with ""win"", then combining with ""baba is you"" (which is active) would make ""baba is win"". So the plan is to move the ""win"" rule to the position of the ""you"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 4 down. That's a significant distance. To move the ""win"" rule down, I need to push it left and down, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 right, 2 up and 1 up, there are walls. Also, the ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 1 down.

Maybe I can use the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up to help. If I can move the ""is"" rule down to the 4 down row, then place the ""win"" next to it. Let's see:

- The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. If I move it down one step to 8 right, 1 up, then maybe","

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. My goal is usually to reach a WIN object, but I need to check if there's any other rule defining WIN.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. But there's also a wall blocking that path. The walls are 4 steps right and 2 steps up, and another wall at 4 right and 1 up. So moving directly right might not work because of those walls.

The rule `is` is at 8 right, 2 up. Maybe I can move that somewhere else to change the rules. Also, there are other rules like `wall` at 1 left and 1 up, `door` at 8 right, 1 down, and `ball` at 8 right, 2 down. The `baba` rule is at 1 left, 4 down, along with `is` and `you`.

Since I'm Baba and can move rules, maybe I can make myself a WIN. If I can create a ""baba is win"" rule, then touching a WIN object would win the level. But how?

First, I need to grab the `is` text block. It's at 8 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. Wait, where am I exactly? The observation doesn't specify my position, but the objects are listed relative to me? Or is the position from the player's perspective? Hmm, maybe I need to figure out where I am based on the objects.

Alternatively, maybe the player's position isn't given, so I have to infer based on the rules. Let me think: the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I must be positioned somewhere on the map. The objects are listed with positions relative to me. For example, the ball is 1 step right and 2 up. So if I move right, I can get to the ball. But there's a wall at 4 right and 2 up, so moving right four steps would hit a wall.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and 2 up, 4 right and 1 up, etc. So perhaps the layout is such that moving right directly towards the WIN is blocked by walls. To get around the wall, maybe I need to manipulate the rules. For instance, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but there's already a ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 left and 1 up. Wait, no, the rule `wall` is at 1 left and 1 up. Wait, looking back:

Objects include:
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
So that's a rule saying ""wall is [something]"". But the active rules only show ""baba is you"". The other rules must be part of the level's initial setup but not active unless moved. So to activate a rule, I need to move its text blocks into the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the rule `wall` at 1 left 1 up is a text block that says ""wall is [something]"". But since it's not an active rule, maybe it's waiting to be combined with an ""is"" rule. Similarly, the `is` rules at various positions can be combined with other rules to form new active rules.

So the plan is: move the 'is' rule to combine with other rule text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I take the 'is' at 8 right, 2 up and move it next to the 'win' rule at 9 right, 2 up, that would create ""win is [something]"". But the 'win' rule is a text block that says ""win is"", so combining with 'is' would make ""win is [blank]"". Wait, no, the 'win' rule is a text block that's part of the initial setup. Maybe the way rules work is that when you have a [Subject] next to an [Property] with 'is', it forms the rule. So to create a new rule, you need a subject, an 'is' rule, and a property.

In this case, the 'win' rule is at 9 right, 2 up. If I can move the 'is' rule at 8 right, 2 up next to it, then combining them would create ""win is [something]"". But what's the something? The 'win' rule is a text block that's already a rule. Maybe the 'win' rule is ""win is [win]"" by default, but that's not active. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the 'win' object is a goal, and the active rule to win is when you are a WIN. So if I can create a rule ""baba is win"", then touching the WIN object would make me win. To do that, I need to take the 'baba' rule, which is at 1 left and 4 down, the 'is' rule at 4 down, and the 'win' rule at 9 right, 2 up. But those are far apart.

Alternatively, maybe I can take the 'is' rule at 1 step up (which is at 1 up, no left/right specified?) Wait, looking at the objects list:

rule `is` 1 step up

So that's an 'is' rule one step up from me. If I move up to get there, then combine it with another rule. For example, the 'ball' rule is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move 'is' next to 'ball', that would make ""ball is [something]"". But what's the property? The 'you' rule is at 1 right and 4 down. If I can get 'is' next to 'baba' and 'you', that could make ""baba is you"", which is already active.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so that's already in place. The challenge is to reach the WIN. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can change the property of the walls to something else, like 'push' or make them movable. Or create a door that I can move through.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'door' rule at 8 right, 1 down. So if I can create a ""door is open"" rule, then maybe I can push through it. But how? To create that, I need the 'door' text block, an 'is' text block, and a 'open' text block. But there's no 'open' rule here. Alternatively, if I can make the door a 'you' or something, but I'm already a 'you'.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall a stop, which it already is, but that doesn't help. Wait, the existing rules include ""wall is stop"" (from the rule `wall` at 1 left 1 up). So walls are stop, meaning they can't be pushed through. But if I can change that rule, like making ""wall is not stop"", but how?

To change a rule, I need to move the existing 'wall is stop' rule and rearrange it. For example, if I take the 'wall' rule (which is a text block saying ""wall is"") and move it next to a different property. But the 'wall' rule is at 1 left 1 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule next to an 'is' and a different property, like 'push', then it would become ""wall is push"". But there's no 'push' rule here.

Alternatively, maybe the 'stop' rule is at 3 right 1 down. If I can make 'stop' a different property. But I don't have a 'stop' text block, just the rule `stop` at that position.

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

1. My goal is to reach the WIN at 9 right, 2 up, but blocked by walls.
2. To get past the walls, I need to either make the walls movable or find another path.
3. The 'door' is at 8 right 1 down. If I can make the door a 'you', then I could step into it. But how?
4. Alternatively, create a rule that allows me to push walls. But there's no 'push' rule here.
5. Another approach: make myself a WIN. If I can create ""baba is win"", then touching the WIN object would win.
   - To do this, I need the 'baba' rule, 'is' rule, and 'win' rule in proximity.
   - The 'baba' rule is at 1 left 4 down.
   - The 'is' rule is at 4 down.
   - The 'win' rule is at 9 right 2 up.
   - These are far apart. Maybe I can move the 'is' rule to a central position.
6. The 'is' rule at 8 right 2 up is probably the most useful because it's closer to the WIN. If I can move that 'is' to near the 'baba' and 'win' rules.

But how to move the 'is' rules? I need to be able to move objects that are not stopped. The current rules say that walls are stop, so I can't move them. But 'is' rules and other text blocks might be movable unless they're part of an active rule with 'stop'.

Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you"". So other text blocks like 'is', 'win', 'wall', etc., can be moved unless they're part of a rule that makes them stop. Since ""wall is stop"" is an inactive rule (because it's a text block waiting to be activated), moving the wall itself is possible? Or are the walls objects that are stopped because of the ""wall is stop"" rule?

This is a bit confusing. Let me recall the tips: You can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if an object is defined as STOP via a rule, you can't move it. But in this case, the active rules only have ""baba is you"". The other rules are text blocks that aren't active yet. So the walls are objects; their property is not STOP unless there's an active rule saying ""wall is stop"". Looking at the active rules, there's none. Wait, no—the initial setup has a rule `wall` at 1 left 1 up. But how does that become an active rule?

Wait, maybe the rule `wall` at 1 left 1 up is a text block that says ""wall is [something]"". For example, if it's placed next to an 'is' rule and a property, it becomes active. But right now, the active rules only show ""baba is you"". So the ""wall is stop"" must be an inactive rule. Therefore, the walls are not stopped, so I can move them?

Wait, but the tips say that if something is defined as STOP, you can't move it. So if there's an active rule ""wall is stop"", you can't move walls. But in this case, is ""wall is stop"" an active rule?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up. That's probably a text block that says ""wall is [stop]"" because it's placed next to the 'is' rule at 1 step up. Let me check:

The objects list includes:
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` 1 step up

If these two are adjacent, then combining them would form the rule ""wall is stop"". So that's an active rule. Therefore, walls are stop, meaning I can't move them. That explains why the path is blocked.

So the walls are stopped, making them immovable. Therefore, I can't push them out of the way. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternative approach: Instead of moving through the walls, go around them. But where is the map layout? The WIN is at 9 right, 2 up, behind walls. To the left, there's a ball at 1 right, 2 up. Maybe there's a path to the left.

Alternatively, use the door at 8 right, 1 down. If I can make the door something I can move through. For example, if I make ""door is you"", then stepping into the door would work. But how?

To create ""door is you"", I need the 'door' rule, 'is' rule, and 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 1 right 4 down. The 'door' rule is at 8 right 1 down. The 'is' rule is at 8 right 2 up or 1 step up.

This might be possible. Let's see:

1. Move to the 'is' rule at 1 step up (which is closer).
2. Then move down to the 'door' rule at 8 right 1 down.
3. Combine them to make ""door is [something]"". But what's the property? The 'you' rule is at 1 right 4 down, which is far away.

Alternatively, use the 'is' rule at 8 right 2 up. If I can move that 'is' to near the 'door' and 'you' rules.

But to move the 'is' at 8 right 2 up, I need to navigate there. My current position is unknown, but the ball is 1 right 2 up. Maybe I'm to the left of the ball.

Assuming I'm positioned such that moving right takes me towards the ball, but there's a wall at 4 right 2 up. So moving right four steps would hit a wall. Therefore, I need to find another way.

Alternatively, use the 'rule `is` 1 step up' which is closer. If I move up to get there, then take that 'is' and move it to the 'door' and 'you' rules.

But how to reach the 'door' which is at 8 right 1 down. That's quite a distance. Maybe I can move diagonally or find a path.

Wait, perhaps I can create a ""baba is door"" rule, making myself a door, which might allow me to move through other doors. But there's no 'door' property rule active.

Alternatively, create ""baba is push"", then push walls. But again, no 'push' rule.

This is tricky. Let's think differently. The WIN is at 9 right 2 up. There's a rule `win` there. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the WIN object would win. To do that, I need to create that rule.

To create ""baba is win"", I need the 'baba' rule, 'is' rule, and 'win' rule in proximity. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left 4 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right 2 up. The 'is' rules are at 8 right 2 up, 1 step up, and 4 down.

The 'is' at 4 down is next to the 'baba' rule and 'you' rule. If I can move that 'is' to near the 'win' rule.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the 'is' rule at 4 down (which is adjacent to 'baba' and 'you').
2. Carry that 'is' rule to the 'win' rule at 9 right 2 up.
3. Place the 'is' next to 'win' to make ""win is [something]"".
4. Then, place 'baba' next to that 'is' and 'win' to make ""baba is win"".

But how to move the 'is' from 4 down to 9 right 2 up? That's a long distance. Maybe there's a more efficient way.

Alternatively, use the 'is' rule at 8 right 2 up. If I can move that one to the 'baba' and 'win' areas.

To get to 8 right 2 up, I need to move right 8 steps and up 2, but there are walls blocking the way at 4 right 2 up. So that's not possible.

Another idea: Use the existing 'is' at 1 step up. If I move up to get there, then move right and down to reach the 'door' and 'you' rules.

But this is getting too vague without knowing my exact position. Maybe I should focus on moving the 'is' at 1 step up to near the 'door' and 'you' to create ""door is you"".

Here's a possible path:

1. Move up once to reach the 'is' rule at 1 step up.
2. Move right to reach the 'door' rule at 8 right 1 down. Wait, that's a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule at 1 step up to the 'door' and 'you' rules. But how?

This is challenging. Maybe the key is to create a rule that makes the door a you, allowing me to step into it.

To do that:

- Need the 'door' rule (8 right 1 down), 'is' rule (either 1 step up or 8 right 2 up), and 'you' rule (1 right 4 down).

If I can move the 'is' rule from 1 step up to near the 'door' and 'you'.

Let's try:

1. Move up to the 'is' at 1 step up.
2. Then move right as much as possible, avoiding walls. The wall at 4 right 2 up is a problem, but if I'm at 1 step up, moving right towards the 'is' at 8 right 2 up. But there's a wall at 4 right 2 up. So maybe move right 3 steps to 3 right 1 up, then down to 3 right 1 down, then right to 4 right 1 down (which is a wall), so can't go further. Hmm.

Alternatively, from the 'is' at 1 step up, move down to 1 step up and original position, then right to 2 right, but there's a wall at 4 right 2 up. This is getting too complicated.

Maybe another approach: Create ""win is you"", making the WIN object a you, so touching it wins. To do that:

1. Take the 'win' rule at 9 right 2 up.
2. Move it next to an 'is' rule and 'you' rule.

The 'you' rule is at 1 right 4 down. The 'is' rules are at 8 right 2 up, 1 step up, and 4 down.

This would require moving the 'win' rule many steps, which is likely blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at 4 down. If I can move that 'is' to near the","

I need to figure out how to get to the win condition in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by understanding the current rules and the map setup.

The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate text blocks because I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I can change that by creating new rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. However, there's also a wall at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, which is blocking that path. To get past the wall, maybe I can change the wall's property or create a rule that makes the wall passable.

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" text block near another text block, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can combine ""is"" with ""win"" or ""wall,"" that might change their meanings.

Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down. The walls around that area are probably acting as STOP because of that rule. But since I'm Baba (YOU), I might be able to move through them unless they have other properties.

The ball is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. Maybe if I make the ball become ""YOU,"" then I can move it to the win spot. To do that, I need to create a ""ball is you"" rule. The ""rule `ball`"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""ball"" text block next to a ""is"" and a ""you,"" I could form ""ball is you.""

Let me check the positions again. The ""rule `is`"" is at 8 right, 2 up. The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 right, 4 down. The ""rule `ball`"" is at 8 right, 2 down. So, if I can move the ""ball"" text block upwards to meet the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks, I can create the necessary rule.

But how do I move these text blocks? Since I'm Baba (YOU), I can move any object that's not STOP. The walls are STOP, but the text blocks like ""is,"" ""win,"" etc., are probably movable unless specified otherwise. Let's confirm: the ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 right, 1 down. So any object with the STOP property can't be moved. The walls here seem to be STOP because of that rule. But the text blocks should be movable unless they're part of a STOP rule.

So, my plan is to:

1. Move the ""rule `ball`"" text block to a position where it can be combined with ""is"" and ""you"" to create ""ball is you.""
2. Once ""ball is you,"" I can then move the ball to the ""win"" location.

But to move the ""rule `ball`"" from 8 right, 2 down to somewhere near the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks. Let's see their positions:

- ""rule `is`"" at 8 right, 2 up.
- ""rule `you`"" at 1 right, 4 down.

Hmm, moving the ""ball"" text block up to 8 right, 2 up might be possible. Let's see if there are any obstacles. The path from 8 right, 2 down to 8 right, 2 up is vertical. Are there walls in between? Looking at the map:

At 4 right, 2 up is a wall. But the text blocks are at 8 right, 2 up, so maybe that's further along. Wait, the walls at 4 right are in different positions. The main obstacle is the wall at 4 right, 2 up, but the text blocks are at 8 right, which is to the right of that wall. So moving the ""ball"" text block up from 8 right, 2 down to 8 right, 2 up should be possible if there's no wall blocking the way. Since the walls are at 4 right, which is left of 8 right, maybe the path is clear.

So, first action: move the ""rule `ball`"" up one step. That would position it at 8 right, 1 down. Wait, but the ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up. So moving the ""ball"" up from 8 right, 2 down to 8 right, 1 down first, then to 8 right, 2 up? Let me check the movement.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" text block to meet the ""ball"" and ""you."" The ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up. If I can move it left to where the ""you"" is at 1 right, 4 down, that might be tricky. Alternatively, move the ""you"" up to meet the ""is"" and ""ball.""

Wait, perhaps a better approach: since ""baba is you,"" I can push or pull text blocks if they are not STOP. The ""rule `ball`"" is at 8 right, 2 down. If I move right from my current position (which isn't specified, but the ball is 1 step right and 2 up from the starting position?), maybe I need to navigate to where the text blocks are.

Wait, the user hasn't specified Baba's current position. But the objects are listed with their positions relative to Baba? Or is the map's coordinate system absolute? This is a bit unclear. The problem says ""ball 1 step to the right and 2 step up"" — perhaps these positions are relative to Baba's location. So, if Baba is at, say, the origin, then the ball is at (1,2), the wall at (4,2), etc.

Assuming that, then the ""rule `is`"" is at (8,2), ""rule `win`"" at (9,2), ""rule `wall`"" at (-1,1), etc. But this is a bit confusing without knowing Baba's position. However, the key is that the text blocks are located at specific coordinates, and I need to move them to form new rules.

Another approach: Since the goal is to reach the ""win"" rule at (9,2), but there's a wall at (4,2). The wall is defined by ""wall is stop"" (from the rule `wall` 1 step left and 1 step up, combined with rule `is` 1 step up). So, the wall's STOP property is active. Since I'm Baba (YOU), normally I can't pass STOP objects. But if I can change the wall's property, maybe to make it PASS or something else.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""wall is you,"" then I could move through the walls. But to do that, I need to form ""wall is you"" by moving the relevant text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks:

- ""rule `is`"" at (8,2)
- ""rule `you`"" at (1,4)
- ""rule `wall`"" at (-1,1)

So, if I can move the ""wall"" text block to be adjacent to an ""is"" and a ""you,"" then I can create ""wall is you."" For example, moving the ""wall"" text block from (-1,1) to (0,1), then to (1,1), where there's an ""is"" at (8,2)? No, that's too far. Alternatively, find a path to bring ""wall"" near ""is"" and ""you.""

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at (8,2) and ""you"" at (1,4). Maybe move the ""is"" down to meet the ""you."" But how?

Alternatively, focus on making the ball the YOU instead. Because then I can move the ball to the win spot. The ""rule `ball`"" is at (8,2) down, so (8, -2) if considering down as negative y. To get the ball to be YOU, I need to form ""ball is you."" So, move the ""ball"" text block next to an ""is"" and a ""you.""

The ""is"" is at (8,2), and ""you"" is at (1,4). The ball is at (8, -2). So, moving the ""ball"" up to (8, -1), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Then, place it next to the ""is"" at (8,2). But to do that, I need to move the ""ball"" up one step. However, is there a wall in the way?

Looking at the map:

At (4,2) there's a wall. But the ball is at (8, -2), so moving up from there would go through (8,-1), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). There's no wall mentioned in those positions except the ones at (4, right), which is left of 8. So the path should be clear.

So, first action: move up to get the ball text block closer to the is at (8,2). But how does moving up affect the position of the text block? Since I'm Baba, and I can push or pull text blocks, maybe I need to be adjacent to the text block and move in a direction to move it.

Assuming that to move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction I want to push it. For example, if I'm next to the ""rule `is`"" text block and move right, it would move right as well.

So, to move the ""rule `ball`"" from (8,-2) to (8,2), I need to navigate there. Let's say I'm currently at a position near the ball. If I move right towards the ball, but the ball is already at (8,-2). Wait, maybe the player (Baba) is somewhere else. Since the observation doesn't specify Baba's position, this is a bit challenging. But perhaps the key is to focus on moving the available text blocks.

Alternatively, look for the closest movable text block. The ""rule `is`"" is at (8,2). If I can move that ""is"" near the ""you"" at (1,4), maybe I can form a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" down to (8,1), (8,0), (7,0), etc., until it's adjacent to ""you.""

But this might take multiple steps. Alternatively, focus on the ""ball"" text block. Let's try to move it up to (8,2) where the ""is"" is. If I can place ""ball"" next to ""is"" and ""you,"" then ""ball is you"" can be formed.

To move the ""ball"" up one step, I need to be adjacent to it and push it up. So, if I move up while being next to the ball, it should move up with me.

Assuming I'm positioned to the left of the ball, I can move right towards it, then up while pushing it. Alternatively, if I'm below the ball, move up to be adjacent, then push up.

But without knowing Baba's exact position, it's a bit tricky, but perhaps the best move is to move the ""rule `is`"" text block towards the ""you"" to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to the right and down to meet ""you.""

Alternatively, let's try to create ""ball is you"" first. The ""ball"" is at (8,-2). The ""is"" is at (8,2). The ""you"" is at (1,4). To get ""ball"" next to ""is,"" I need to move it up to (8,2). Then, next to ""you,"" which is at (1,4), that's quite far. Maybe instead, move the ""is"" down to (8,1), then (8,0), then (7,0), etc., until it's near the ""you.""

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at (8,2) and move the ""you"" up to meet it. The ""you"" is at (1,4). Moving it up would require pushing it through the area. But there's a wall at (4,2), but the ""you"" is at (1,4), which is to the left of that wall. So maybe possible.

But this seems complicated. Another angle: since the ""win"" is at (9,2), and there's a wall at (4,2), maybe I can make the wall passable by changing its rule. For example, if I create ""wall is you,"" then I can move through the walls, but that requires forming that rule.

Alternatively, create a ""win is push"" or something, but I don't have a ""push"" rule. The available rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" etc.

Wait, there's a ""rule `door`"" at (8,1 down). So door is probably a toggleable object. Maybe if I make door be something else, but not sure.

Another idea: Since the ball is near the win rule, maybe if I make the ball win, then touching it would win the level. So create ""ball is win."" To do that, need ""ball"" next to ""is"" and ""win.""

The ""win"" is at (9,2), and the ""ball"" is at (8,-2). That's quite far. But maybe there's a way to move the ""win"" rule closer.

Alternatively, make the win rule move. If I can create ""win is push,"" then maybe push it, but I don't have a push rule.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's recap:

Current rules: baba is you.

Objects:

- Ball near (1,2) (relative to Baba)
- Wall blocking the path to win at (9,2)
- Text blocks available: is at (8,2), win at (9,2), wall at (-1,1), you at (1,4), door at (8,1 down), etc.

Plan:

1. Make the ball a YOU so I can move it to the win spot.
   - Need to create ""ball is you.""
   - Available components: rule `ball` at (8,2 down), rule `is` at (8,2), rule `you` at (1,4).

   So, need to bring rule `ball`, rule `is`, and rule `you` together.

2. To do that, maybe move the rule `ball` up to (8,2) next to the rule `is`, then move the rule `you` down to be next to them.

But how to move them?

Assuming I'm at Baba's position, which isn't specified, but perhaps near the ball or the rules.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" text block to where the ""you"" is. For example, move ""is"" from (8,2) to (7,2), (6,2), etc., until it's next to ""you"" at (1,4). That's a long way, but possible by moving left multiple times.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" up to meet the ""is."" The ""you"" is at (1,4). Moving it up would require pushing it through the area. For example, move up from (1,4) to (1,3), then (1,2), etc., but there's a wall at (4,2), but the ""you"" is at (1,4), so moving up should be possible unless there's a wall in the way.

Assuming there's no wall between (1,4) and (8,2), which seems likely, then moving the ""you"" up towards the ""is"" and ""ball"" could work.

But this is getting too vague without knowing Baba's position. Maybe the immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" text block at (8,2) to get closer to it.

Alternatively, since the ""rule `is`"" is at (8,2), and the ""rule `ball`"" is at (8,2 down), moving up from the ball's position would bring it next to the ""is.""

So, the ball is at (8,-2). Moving up once would take it to (8,-1), then again to (8,0), then (8,1), then (8,2). At (8,2), it would be next to the ""is"" rule. Then, if the ""you"" rule is somewhere else, maybe bring it next to them.

But where is the ""you"" rule? It's at (1,4). So after placing the ""ball"" next to ""is,"" I need to bring the ""you"" rule down to (8,2) area.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule down from (1,4) to (1,3), (1,2), etc., until it's next to the ""is"" and ""ball.""

This seems like a multi-step process. The immediate action should be to move the ""ball"" up to the ""is"" location.

So, the chosen action is to move up from the ball's current position to get it next to the ""is"" rule. Assuming the ball is one step below the ""is,"" moving up once would position it adjacent.

Let's try to figure out this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""BABA IS YOU,"" which means I can move around and push things unless they're STOP. The goal is usually to get to WIN, which is a ball now? Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects, there's a ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up from where I probably am. Then there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and some rules like ""IS"" at various positions. The WIN rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, but I need to reach that. However, there's a wall blocking the path directly.

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is 1 step to the left. So that means whatever the wall is, it's defined as a wall because of that rule. But since I'm BABA and can push things unless they're STOP, maybe I can move the wall? Wait, no, the wall is defined by the ""wall IS WALL"" rule, which is at 1 step left and 1 step up. So if I can rearrange those rules, maybe I can change the wall's behavior.

The key here is probably to grab the ""IS"" text block. The ""IS"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up is near the WIN rule. If I can move ""IS"" to connect to WIN, making ""WIN IS YOU"" or ""WIN IS WIN"" or something. But first, I need to see where I am. The last action was ""up,"" which moved me up. Now, in the current observation, the ""IS"" rule is 1 step up, the ball is 1 right and 1 up, and the wall is 4 right and 1 up.

If I can get to the ""IS"" block at 8 steps right and 1 step up, which is near the WIN rule. But there's a wall 4 steps right and 1 step up blocking the way. So how to get past that? The wall is 4 steps right and 1 step up. Since I'm BABA, I can push it if it's not STOP. But the wall's rule is ""wall IS WALL,"" which is at 1 step left and 1 step up. So unless there's a ""STOP"" property, I can push the wall. Wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is probably not in the way right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the wall not a wall. For example, if I take the ""wall"" rule and move it somewhere else, then the wall might become something else. Let me check the objects again.

The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what the wall does. But to move a rule, I need to be next to it and it's not STOP. The ""wall"" rule is 1 step left, so if I move left from my current position, I can grab it. But where am I? After moving up, maybe my position is adjusted. Let's assume my current position is somewhere, and the objects are relative to me.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to make the ball the WIN. Since the WIN rule is separate, if I can attach ""IS WIN"" to the ball. The ball is at 1 right and 1 up. There's an ""IS"" at 1 step up. So if I can move the ""IS"" next to the ball, making ""BALL IS WIN,"" then touching the ball would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the ""IS"" block that's 1 step up to be next to the ball. But the ball is 1 right and 1 up. So from my current position, which is probably where the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule was before, moving right once would get me next to the ball, but there's the ""IS"" block 1 step up. Wait, maybe I need to move downwards or another direction.

Alternatively, the ""IS"" block at 8 steps right and 1 step up is closer to the WIN rule. If I can move that ""IS"" to connect to the WIN, making ""WIN IS YOU"" or ""WIN IS WIN."" But the WIN is 9 steps right and 1 step up, so the ""IS"" is one step left of that. If I can move the ""IS"" to be between WIN and something else.

But how do I get to that ""IS"" block? There's a wall 4 steps right and 1 step up. So perhaps I need to push that wall out of the way. Since I can push walls (as they're not STOP), moving them by pushing. Let's see, the wall is 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I move right towards it, I can push it further right. But the ""IS"" block is 8 steps right and 1 step up, which is beyond that wall. So pushing the wall right would create a path to the ""IS"" block.

Wait, but the wall is 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I move right from my current position, I can get to the wall. Since I'm BABA, I can push the wall. Let's say I move right once, then right again, pushing the wall each time. But the wall is 4 steps right, so maybe I need to be adjacent to it. Once I push the wall right, then the ""IS"" block at 8 steps right becomes accessible.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. The ""rule `door`"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Not sure if that's useful yet. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which might block movement if something is STOP.

Another angle: Since I'm BABA and can become other objects by making rules, maybe I can turn myself into WIN. If I can create a ""BABA IS WIN"" rule, then touching the WIN object would make me win. But how to create that? I need the ""WIN"" text block and an ""IS"" text block next to each other.

The ""WIN"" rule is 9 steps right and 1 step up. There's an ""IS"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the ""IS"" one step to the right, it would be next to the WIN, making ""WIN IS ..."". Wait, but the WIN rule is ""rule `win` 9 steps right and 1 step up"", so the text is ""win"". If I place an ""IS"" next to it, then maybe ""WIN IS YOU"" or something. But I need to have the ""you"" rule as well. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down, which is pretty far.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball the WIN. The ball is at 1 right and 1 up. There's an ""IS"" at 1 step up. So moving the ""IS"" down to be next to the ball. So if I can grab the ""IS"" block that's 1 step up and move it down to the ball's position, then it would say ""BALL IS WIN"". Then, touching the ball would make me win since I'm BABA.

To do that, I need to move the ""IS"" block from 1 step up to be next to the ball. The ball is 1 right and 1 up. So the ""IS"" block is 1 step up from my current position. If I move down to get next to the ball, then move the ""IS"" block to the ball's position.

Wait, let me visualize the map. Let's assume my current position is at the origin (0,0). Then:

- The ball is at (1,1)
- The wall is at (4,1)
- The ""IS"" block that's 1 step up is at (0,1)
- The ""WIN"" rule is at (9,1)
- The other ""IS"" is at (8,1), next to the WIN
- The ""ball"" rule is at (8,3)
- The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,5)
- The ""you"" rule is at (1,5)

So to get to the ball at (1,1), I need to move right once and down once. But there's an ""IS"" block at (0,1) which is 1 step up from me. Wait, maybe my position is different. Let's see: the active rules still say ""baba is you"", so I'm a baba. The objects are listed with their positions relative to me.

So the ball is 1 right and 2 up from me initially? Wait, the first observation had the ball 1 step right and 2 up. But after moving up, the current observation shows the ball 1 step right and 1 step up. So maybe my position changed after moving up.

In the current observation after moving up, the ball is 1 right and 1 up. The ""IS"" rule is 1 step up. So if I'm at (0,0), the ""IS"" is at (0,1), the ball is at (1,1), and the wall is at (4,1). To get to the ball, I can move right once. But the ""IS"" is at (0,1), which is above me. Wait, maybe the directions are a bit different. Let's clarify:

The positions are described as [step direction] and number of steps. For example, ""ball 1 step to the right and 2 step up"" means the ball is to the right and up from my current position.

So in the current observation, after moving up, the ball is 1 right and 1 up. The ""IS"" block is 1 step up (so directly above me). The wall is 4 right and 1 up, so quite far to the right.

To reach the ball, I need to go right once. But the ""IS"" block is above me. If I move down from the ""IS"" block, I can get to the ball's position. Wait, maybe I need to rearrange the ""IS"" block to be next to the ball.

So the plan is: move to the ""IS"" block that's 1 step up, then move it down to be next to the ball. But how?

First, to reach the ""IS"" block at 1 step up, I need to move up once. But I already moved up in the previous action. Wait, in the current observation, after moving up, the ""IS"" block is 1 step up. So my current position is such that the ""IS"" is above me. To get to it, I need to move up again? But that might not be possible if there's an object there.

Wait, maybe I'm next to the ""IS"" block. If I'm at (0,0), the ""IS"" is at (0,1). So moving up once would take me to (0,1), which is the ""IS"" block. Then, from there, I can move right to get to the ball at (1,1). But the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""IS"" block's position. So moving right from the ""IS"" block would place me next to the ball.

But the ball is an object. Can I push it? Since the ball's rule is ""rule `ball` 8 steps right and 2 steps down"", which is probably a separate text block. The active rule is still ""baba is you"", so I can push objects unless they're STOP. The ball isn't defined as STOP, so I can push it.

So here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Move up to reach the ""IS"" block (1 step up from my current position).
2. From there, move right to the ball's position (1 step right).
3. Then, move the ""IS"" block down to be next to the ball, creating ""BALL IS WIN"".

But how to move the ""IS"" block? Once I'm next to it, I can push it. Since ""IS"" is a text block, and I'm BABA (you), I can move it unless it's STOP. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which isn't in the vicinity.

So, let's try to execute this:

First action: move up to get to the ""IS"" block. But in the current observation, after moving up previously, the ""IS"" is already 1 step up. So maybe I'm adjacent to it. Then, move right to the ball. Then, take the ""IS"" block and move it down to the ball's position.

Wait, but the ball is at (1,1), and the ""IS"" is at (0,1). So moving right from the ""IS"" block gets me to (1,1), which is the ball. Then, I can pick up the ""IS"" block and move it down to (1,0), placing it next to the ball. That would make ""BALL IS WIN"" if the WIN rule is somewhere nearby.

The WIN rule is at (9,1), which is far to the right. Alternatively, if I can make the ball the WIN, then touching it would make me win. To do that, I need ""BALL IS WIN"". The ball is at (1,1), and the WIN rule is at (9,1). The ""IS"" block is at (0,1). So if I can move the ""IS"" block from (0,1) to (1,1), adjacent to the ball, then it would be ""BALL IS ..."". But the WIN is at (9,1), so unless there's another ""WIN"" text block near the ball, this might not work.

Wait, there's a ""rule `win`"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So the text ""win"" is there. If I can create a rule ""BALL IS WIN"", that would require the ""BALL"" text block and the ""WIN"" text block linked by ""IS"". The ""BALL"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, which is separate. So maybe I need to bring the ""WIN"" text block near the ball.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler solution: since I'm BABA and can be anyone, maybe I can turn the ball into the WIN by creating a rule ""BALL IS WIN"". To do that, I need the ""BALL"" text block and the ""WIN"" text block connected with ""IS"".

The ""BALL"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, and the ""WIN"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. The ""IS"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the ""IS"" from (8,1) to between ""BALL"" and ""WIN"", making ""BALL IS WIN"".

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""IS"" at (8,1). But there's a wall at (4,1) which is 4 steps right and 1 step up. So I need to push that wall out of the way. Since I can push walls, I can move right towards it, pushing it each time until it's out of the path.

Let me outline the steps:

1. From current position, move right towards the wall at (4,1). Each time I move right, I push the wall further right.
2. Continue pushing the wall until it's no longer blocking the path to the ""IS"" at (8,1).
3. Once past the wall, move to the ""IS"" block at (8,1).
4. Move the ""IS"" block left to place it between the ""BALL"" rule (8,2 down) and the ""WIN"" rule (9,1 up). Wait, the positions are a bit confusing. Let me map them again.

Assuming my current position is where the ""IS"" was after moving up, which is (0,1). The wall is at (4,1). To get to the ""IS"" at (8,1), I need to move right 8 times, but there's a wall at (4,1). So pushing the wall right each time I move right.

For example:

- Move right once: push the wall from (4,1) to (5,1).
- Move right again: push to (6,1).
- Continue until the wall is at (8,1), allowing me to pass.

But that would take multiple steps. However, each time I move right, I have to be adjacent to the wall to push it. So:

1. Move right to (1,1) (next to the wall at (4,1)? No, the wall is at (4,1), which is 4 steps right from my current position at (0,0). Wait, maybe my current position is different. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the quickest way is to move right past the wall by pushing it. Since the wall is 4 steps right and 1 step up, and the ""IS"" is 8 steps right and 1 step up, the distance between them is 4 steps. So pushing the wall right four times would move it to (8,1), allowing access to the ""IS"".

But how to do that in actions:

- From current position (assuming it's at (0,0)), the wall is at (4,1).
- Move right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to be next to the wall.
- Push the wall right by moving right while adjacent to it. Each move right would push the wall further right.

For example:

1. Move up to (1,1) (adjacent to the wall at (4,1)? No, that's not adjacent. Maybe I need to reposition.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on making the ball the WIN. Since the ball is near me, and there's an ""IS"" above me, perhaps I can move that ""IS"" down to the ball.

So steps:

1. Move up to reach the ""IS"" block (1 step up).
2. Move right to the ball's position (1 step right).
3. Take the ""IS"" block and move it down to be next to the ball, creating ""BALL IS WIN"".

But how to move the ""IS"" block down. If I'm next to the ""IS"" block at (0,1), moving down would take me to (0,0), which is my original position. Then, moving right to (1,0), but the ball is at (1,1). Hmm.

Alternatively, after moving up to the ""IS"" block at (0,1), move right to (1,1) (the ball), then move the ""IS"" block from (0,1) to (1,1), placing it next to the ball. That would make ""BALL IS ..."", but what's the other part? We need ""WIN"" next to","

Let's see. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I am Baba. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if the rules have been changed.

Looking at the objects on the map: there's a ball to the right and up, a bunch of walls, and some rules scattered around. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But I might need to manipulate the rules to make moving past the walls easier.

First, I notice there are several ""is"" rules. The ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up"" was part of the previous observation, but now after moving up, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step up. Maybe I can pick up an ""is"" rule and move it to create a new rule. 

The walls are all along the right side, blocking my path to the ""win"" object. If I can create a rule that makes a wall stop being a wall, or maybe make the ball a win, that could help. For example, if I can say ""wall is stop,"" then walls would be immovable, but I might not want that. Alternatively, ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition, which is nearby. 

But to do any of that, I need to move the ""is"" rule text block. Let's see where the ""is"" rule is located. In the current observation, the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. So if I move right towards it, maybe I can pick it up and then move it to where the ball or another object is. 

Wait, the ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up from my current position. But I need to check if I can move towards the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is 1 step up, so if I'm currently at the same position as Baba, moving up once would reach it. But in the current observation, the active rules still have ""baba is you,"" so I can move. 

Wait, the observation shows the active rules as ""baba is you,"" so I can move. My current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Let's assume I'm at the starting position. The ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up initially, but after moving up once, the positions might have shifted. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, pick it up, and then move it to the ball or another object. For example, moving right to get to the ""is"" rule, then moving right again to place it next to the ball, and then creating a rule like ""ball is win."" 

But how do I know where I am? The problem is that the exact positions of Baba are not given, but the objects are relative. Let me try to reconstruct the map. 

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 up, which might be blocking a path. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 up, which is far to the right. The ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 down, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. 

The key is to manipulate the rules. The ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is nearby. If I can move that ""is"" to somewhere else, I can create a new rule. For example, moving right to get the ""is,"" then moving up to place it next to the ball, and then combining it with ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is already present at 9 steps right and 1 up. But the ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 1 up. So if I can create ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. That seems possible. 

To do that, I need to grab the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is 1 step up from my current position. If I move up once, I can pick it up. Then move right to reach the ball, and place the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is far away. Alternatively, maybe create ""ball is you"" so that I can move as the ball. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is stop,"" but the walls are already there. Hmm. 

Alternatively, ""door is push"" might help, but there's no rule for that. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move to the ""rule `baba`"" that's 1 step left and 4 steps down, and combine it with ""is"" and ""you"" to change the rule. Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you."" Maybe I can go there and rearrange those to make ""baba is win"" or something. 

But that seems complicated. Let me focus on the immediate goal. The ""win"" is far to the right, blocked by walls. The ball is closer. Maybe making the ball win is easier. 

So steps: 

1. Move up to get the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. 
2. Move right to reach the ball (which is 1 step right and 1 step up). 
3. Place the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule to create ""ball is win."" 

But how do I know the exact positions? Let's assume that after moving up once, I'm at the position of the ""is"" rule. Then moving right twice would get me to the ball. Then placing the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 up, which is to the right of the current position. But the walls are blocking the path. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 8 steps right and 2 down. If I can make the door not a stop, I could go through it. For example, making ""door is not stop"" or something. But there's no ""not"" rule here. 

Another idea: since the walls are 4 steps right, maybe there's a pattern. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" suggests that there's a rule stating that something is a wall. If I can change that rule, maybe walls become passable. 

But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move text blocks that aren't stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So I can move the ""is"" rules, but not the ""stop"" or ""wall"" properties unless I change their definitions. 

Wait, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push,"" then I could push the walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule. 

The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is present. So if I can grab the ""is"" rule and place it next to that ""wall"" rule and maybe another property, like ""push,"" but there's no ""push"" rule here. 

Alternatively, ""wall is you"" would make the walls movable. But I need to be careful. 

Hmm. Let me try to outline possible steps again. 

Current active rule: baba is you. 

Objects nearby: 

- rule `is` 1 step up. 

- ball 1 step right and 1 step up. 

- wall 4 steps right and 1 step up. 

So if I move up once, I can get the ""is"" rule. Then move right twice (since ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" position). Once I have the ""is,"" I can place it next to the ball and the ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win."" 

But where is the ""win"" rule? It's at 9 steps right and 1 step up, which is to the right of the current area. So after placing the ""is"" next to the ball, I need to move to the ""win"" rule and combine them. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" rule is already in place, so creating ""ball is win"" would make touching the ball win. 

So the plan is: 

1. Move up to get the ""is"" rule. 

2. Move right to reach the ball. 

3. Place the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule to create ""ball is win."" 

But how do I know the exact positions? Let's assume that after moving up, I'm at the ""is"" location. Then moving right once gets me to the ball (since ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is""). Then I need to move right again to reach the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right. But that's a long way, and there are walls in between. 

Alternatively, maybe create ""ball is you"" so I can move as the ball. Then go to the ball and touch it, but that doesn't help. 

Wait, if I make ""ball is you,"" then I can turn into the ball and move it. Then maybe move it to the ""win"" spot. But the ball is already there; the ""win"" is at 9 steps right. So if the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up, that's not close. 

Alternatively, make ""you is win,"" but that doesn't make sense. 

Another angle: the ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" could be useful. If I can make the door not a stop, I could go through it. For example, ""door is not stop"" or ""door is push."" 

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" is at 8 right, 2 down. My current position after moving up is 1 step up, so moving down to 2 steps down would reach the door's area. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which I can't move. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to prioritize. The immediate goal is to reach the ""win"" object. Since it's far to the right, blocked by walls, maybe creating a rule that lets me pass through walls or makes the walls movable. 

If I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is push,"" then I could push the walls aside. To do that, I need to find the existing ""wall"" rule and change its property. The existing rule is ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left,"" which probably means ""wall is [something]."" Wait, the active rules include ""baba is you"" and ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up."" Wait, no, in the current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules are objects on the map, like text blocks. 

So the text blocks are separate from the active rules. The active rules are the ones formed by the text blocks that are in the correct format. So ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block, not an active rule. The active rules are ""baba is you."" 

So to create a new rule, I need to combine a subject, an ""is"" text block, and a property. For example, take the ""ball"" object, move it next to an ""is"" rule, and then a ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win."" 

So the steps: 

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. 

2. Move right to the ball (1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is""). 

3. Place the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule (which is 9 steps right and 1 step up). But that's a long distance. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" rule is near the ball? No, the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up, and the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. 

This is a problem. Maybe there's another way. 

Looking at the other rules: there's a ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" If I can make the door a win, that might help. So create ""door is win."" 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the door's position and combine it with ""door"" and ""win."" 

The door is at 8 right, 2 down. My current position after moving up is 1 step up. So I need to move down 3 steps to reach 2 steps down, then right 7 steps to reach 8 steps right. But there are walls along the way. Specifically, wall 4 steps right and 2 steps down, and others. 

The wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down is a problem. If I can make that wall not a stop, I can pass through. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe create a rule like ""wall is you,"" making walls movable. Then push them out of the way. 

To make ""wall is you,"" I need to find the ""wall"" text block (which is at 1 step left and 1 step up) and combine it with an ""is"" rule and ""you."" 

So steps: 

1. Move up to get the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. 

2. Move left to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step up. 

3. Place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""you"" (which is at 1 step right and 4 steps down). But that's far away. 

This seems too complicated. Maybe focus on making the ball the win condition. 

Alternatively, go to the ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down, combine it with ""is"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" But that would make me win just by existing, which is possible. 

So steps: 

1. Move down to reach the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down. 

But how? From the current position (assuming I'm where the active rules are, which is probably the starting point), moving down multiple steps. 

But there are walls blocking the path. For example, wall 4 steps right and 1 step down, stop at 3 steps right and 1 step down, etc. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to simplify. The key is to find the ""is"" rule and use it to create a new rule that alters the win condition or makes obstacles passable. 

The closest ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I can move there, then perhaps create a rule that makes the ball win. 

So action sequence: 

- Move up once to reach the ""is"" rule. 

- Then move right twice to reach the ball (since it's 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is""). 

- Now, the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up from where I am. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up, which is 8 steps to the right. So from the ball's position, moving right 8 steps would reach the ""win"" rule. But there are walls in between. 

Alternatively, after placing the ""is"" next to the ball, I need to also have the ""win"" rule nearby. But the ""win"" rule is far away. 

Wait, maybe the ""win"" rule is already in the correct position, so creating ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win object. Then, if I can reach the ball, I win. 

So the steps would be: 

1. Move up to get the ""is"" rule. 

2. Move right to the ball. 

3. Place the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. 

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, so I need to move the ""is"" there. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" rule is close to the ball in the current observation. Let me check again. 

In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. So the distance between them is 8 steps to the right. 

This seems impractical. Maybe there's another way. 

Looking at the other rules: there's a ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" If I can make the door a win, that might be closer. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the door's position and combine it with ""door"" and ""win."" 

The door is at 8 right, 2 down. From the current position (assuming after moving up to 1 step up), moving down 3 steps to reach 2 steps down, then right 7 steps to reach 8 steps right. But along the way, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a problem. 

If I can make that wall not a stop, I can move through. To do that, I need to change the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is present. Maybe I can create ""wall is push"" by combining ""wall,"" ""is,"" and ""push."" But there's no ""push"" rule. 

Alternatively, ""wall is you,"" making walls movable. 

So steps to make ""wall is you"": 

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step up. 

2. Grab the ""is"" rule (1 step up). 

3. Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 4 steps down. 

4. Place the ""is"" between ""wall"" and ""you"" to create ""wall is you."" 

Once that's done, the walls would be movable. Then I can push them out of the way to reach the door or the ball. 

But this requires navigating through the map, which is blocked by walls and stops. 

Alternatively, focus on making the ball win. 

Another idea: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can create a rule that makes ""baba"" a win. So ""baba is win."" 

To do that, find the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down, the ""is"" rule, and the ""win"" rule. 

So steps: 

1. Move down to the ""baba"" rule area. 

But there are walls blocking the path. For","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to become ""win,"" but maybe that's changeable.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball to the right and up two steps. There are a lot of walls positioned in a grid-like pattern. There are also some rules scattered around: ""is"" blocks, ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball,"" ""baba,"" and ""you."" The ""door"" is 8 steps to the right and 2 down, which might be the exit. But doors are usually stopped by walls unless there's a rule allowing movement through them.

Since I'm Baba and can push text blocks, maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""ball"" the win condition or turns me into something that can pass through walls. Let me check the positions of the rule blocks. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 up, and ""win"" is right next to it at 9 steps right and 2 up. If I can move the ""win"" block somewhere else and create a new rule, like ""ball is win,"" then maybe stepping on the ball would make me win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule and the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" block is at 8 right, 2 up. So if I move that ""is"" block next to the ball, which is 1 right and 2 up, maybe I can make ""ball is win."" Wait, the ball is at 1 step right and 2 up. The ""is"" block is at 8 right, 2 up. That's pretty far away. How do I get there?

First, I need to navigate to where the ""is"" block is located. The current position of Baba isn't given, but looking at the objects, maybe I'm starting somewhere in the grid. The walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. The ""is"" blocks are at 1 up, 8 right and 1 up, and others further down. Maybe I need to move down to reach the lower ""is"" blocks at 5 steps down. 

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 5 down, and ""is"" is at 5 down, and ""you"" is 1 right and 5 down. So if I can get to that lower area, maybe I can manipulate those rules. But how do I get there? Let's think about the movement. The walls are everywhere, but since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects unless they're marked ""stop"" or similar. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right and 2 down. So I can't move past that unless I change the ""stop"" property.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing ""wall"" rules. The rule ""wall"" is at 1 left and 1 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can clear a path. But moving a rule requires that I'm not blocked by a ""stop"" or a wall defined with ""stop."" Let's see. The ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down. So if I'm trying to move a rule towards that area, I might get blocked.

Another approach: The ""door"" is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can create a rule that makes the door passable, like ""door is you"" or ""door is stop"" (but that's already there). Wait, the existing rules have ""stop"" at 3 right, 2 down. Maybe I need to delete the ""stop"" rule. But how? You can't delete rules, only move them. So if I move the ""stop"" rule away, then the door's stop property is removed.

But the problem is moving the ""stop"" rule. Let's check where it is. It's at 3 right, 2 down. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it in a direction. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can push it unless it's stopped. But the ""stop"" rule is at that position, so maybe pushing it is allowed. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a property, not an object. The actual object is the wall with the ""stop"" rule. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to reach the lower ""is"" and ""you"" rules. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down, and ""you"" is 1 right, 5 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" (which is already active), but maybe change ""you"" to something else. Or change ""baba"" to be ""win."" For example, if I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then stepping on Baba would make me win. But how?

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you."" So if I can create a new rule that says ""you is win,"" then since I'm you, I would be win. But to create that, I need to have a ""you"" rule and an ""is"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down, and ""is"" is at 5 down. So if I can move the ""is"" next to the ""you"" rule, then I can make ""you is win."" But where is ""win""? The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. That's far away.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball the win. The ball is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball and use an ""is"" rule, then ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition. Let's see. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. So if I move that ""is"" to the ball's position (1 right, 2 up), and then move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ""is,"" then I can write ""ball is win."" But how to do that step by step.

First, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up. From the current observation, the ball is 1 right and 2 up. The ""is"" is 7 steps to the right of the ball. So to get there, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 4 right in various positions. Let's check the path. From the ball's position (1 right, 2 up), moving right would take me through walls at 4 right, which are blocking. So maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to delete the wall rules.

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then maybe the path is cleared. But moving the ""wall"" rule would require pushing it. Let's suppose I'm at the ball's position. To move the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 up, I would need to be adjacent to it and push it. But how do I get there? The path might be blocked by other walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's try another angle. Since I'm Baba and can push text blocks, maybe I can create a rule that makes me able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop."" But to create that, I need an ""is not"" rule, which doesn't exist here. The available rules are ""is"" and properties like ""win,"" ""wall,"" etc.

Alternatively, make the door passable. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can change the ""stop"" rule's position, maybe the door isn't stopped anymore. The ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down. If I move the ""stop"" rule away, then the door's stop property is removed. But how to move the ""stop"" rule. I would need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. Let's see if there's a path to get there.

From the current position (assuming I'm starting near the ball or somewhere else), moving down to reach 2 down might be possible. But there's a wall at 4 right, 2 down. So maybe I need to find a way around. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new paths.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can push other objects. The ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up is a text block. If I can move that ""is"" to be next to the ""win"" rule (9 right, 2 up), then I could create ""win is [something]."" But what's the goal here. If I make ""win is ball,"" then stepping on the ball would make me win.

But the ""win"" rule is already next to the ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up. So if I move the ""is"" to the left next to the ""win,"" then I can write ""win is [something]."" But what's available? The ball is at 1 right, 2 up, which is far away. Maybe I need to bring the ""win"" rule next to the ball. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the ""door"" rule somewhere. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make the door a ""win,"" then walking through it would win. But to do that, I need to create ""door is win."" The ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 2 down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 step up. So maybe moving the ""is"" down to be next to the door and then setting ""door is win.""

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up down to 8 right, 2 down (adjacent to the door).
2. Move the ""win"" rule from 9 right, 1 up to 9 right, 2 down (next to the ""is"").
3. Now, the rule would be ""door is win,"" making the door the win condition.
4. Then, navigate to the door and step on it to win.

But how to physically move those rules. Let's see. The ""is"" block is at 8 right, 2 up. To move it down one step, I need to be adjacent to it and push it down. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can push it unless it's stopped. The area around 8 right, 2 up has a wall at 4 right, 2 up, but that's to the left. So moving the ""is"" block down should be possible if I can get to its position.

Assuming I'm at 8 right, 2 up, I can push the ""is"" block down. Then, from there, move to the door's position (8 right, 2 down) and push the ""win"" block next to it. Once ""door is win"" is created, walking through the door would make me win.

But how do I get to the ""is"" block at 8 right, 2 up from my current position? The current observation shows that after moving up previously, the active objects have shifted. The latest observation after moving up shows that the ""is"" block is now at 1 step up, and the ball is 1 right and 1 up. The wall at 4 right, 1 up is still there. So maybe the player's position is somewhere in the grid, but it's not explicitly stated.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to use the lower ""is"" and ""you"" rules. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down, ""is"" at 5 down, and ""you"" at 1 right, 5 down. If I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then since I'm Baba, I would be win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then add ""win"" next to it.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The ""is"" rule is at 5 down. So moving the ""is"" from 5 down to 1 left, 5 down (adjacent to ""baba""). Then, bring the ""win"" rule from 9 right, 1 up to 1 left, 5 down next to ""is."" That would create ""baba is win.""

But how to move those rules. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up, which is far from the lower area. Maybe there's a way to move it down, but the path is blocked by walls. This seems challenging.

Another idea: Since the ball is at 1 right, 2 up, and there's an ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up, maybe I can move the ""is"" to the left next to the ball. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up, so moving left seven steps would get it next to the ball. But there's a wall at 4 right, 2 up, which blocks the path. So unless I can move that wall's rule, I can't get past.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move that to clear a path, maybe. But moving it requires being adjacent and pushing it. Let's say I'm at the ball's position (1 right, 2 up). To reach the ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up, I need to move right seven times, but there's a wall at 4 right. So that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the intended solution is different.

Wait, looking back at the initial observation, after moving up, the ""is"" block is now at 1 step up, and the ball is 1 right and 1 up. Maybe I'm adjacent to the ball. If I push the ball to the right, towards the ""is"" block at 8 right, 2 up. But the ball's current position is 1 right, 1 up. To move it right, I need to be next to it. If I'm on the ball, I can push it right, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So pushing the ball right would hit the wall and stop.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that makes the wall passable. For example, ""wall is you,"" but that might not help. Or ""wall is stop"" which is already there. Not sure.

Wait, another approach: The ""door"" is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make the door a win, then go through it. To do that, I need to create ""door is win."" The ""door"" rule is at 8 right, 2 down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 step up. So if I can move the ""is"" down to 8 right, 2 down and then place the ""win"" next to it.

To move the ""is"" from 8 right, 2 up to 8 right, 2 down, I need to be adjacent to it and push it down. Assuming I'm at 8 right, 2 up, I can push the ""is"" down. Then, from there, move to 8 right, 2 down and push the ""win"" rule (which is at 9 right, 1 up) down and left to be next to the ""is."" But the ""win"" rule is far away.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think about the existing rules. The active rule is ""baba is you."" The goal is usually to become ""win,"" but maybe the actual win condition is a different object. If I can turn myself into ""win,"" that would work.

To do that, I need to create a rule ""baba is win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 5 down. So if I can move the ""is"" to be next to ""baba"" and then add ""win"" next to it.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. To get it to the lower area, I need to move it down and left. But the path is blocked by walls. Unless I can delete some walls by moving their rules.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, maybe the path is cleared. For example, moving it left or down. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new rules. For instance, if I can move the ""is"" at 5 down next to ""baba"" and then move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is.""

But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. To get it to 5 down, I'd have to move it left 4 steps and down 4 steps. That's a lot, and the path is blocked by walls.

This is really tricky. Let's try to outline possible moves step by step:

1. Move to the position of the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up.
2. Push that ""is"" block down to 8 right, 2 down (adjacent to the door).
3. Move to the door's position (8 right, 2 down) and push the ""win"" block (which is at 9 right, 1 up) down and left to be next to the ""is.""
4. This creates ""door is win.""
5. Then, walk through the door to win.

But how to move the ""win"" block from 9 right, 1 up to 8 right, 2 down. That requires moving it left 1 step and down 1 step. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" block and push it. Let's say after moving the ""is"" down, I'm at 8 right, 2 down. Then, I need to go to 9 right, 1 up to get the ""win"" block. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 4 right in various positions, making movement difficult.

Alternatively, maybe use the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" to create a new ""is"" block somewhere. Wait, you can't create new rules, only move existing ones.

Another idea: Use the ""rule `is` 4 steps down"" to create a new rule. The ""is"" at 4 steps down is at the same position as the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules. If I can move that","

6,down,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you"", which means I can move around and manipulate text blocks. The goal is probably to become ""win"" or push something that becomes ""win"". Looking at the objects:

There's a ball one step right and two up from my current position. There are walls in various directions, and some rules scattered around. The ""win"" rule is nine steps to the right and two up. But the path is blocked by walls. There's also a ""door"" eight steps right and two down, and a ""ball"" rule there too.

Hmm, maybe I need to create a new rule to override something. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that ""is"" to combine with the ""ball"" or ""win"" somewhere. Wait, the ""win"" is already a rule, but it's separate. If I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. Let me check where the ""ball"" rule is. It's at 8 steps right and 2 down. So maybe I need to move the ""is"" from 8 right and 2 up to next to the ""ball"" rule at 8 right and 2 down. Then combine ""ball is win"". But how do I move those?

First, I need to find the ""is"" block. The ""is"" is at 1 step up, 8 right and 1 step up. Wait, the current position of ""is"" is 1 step up. So if I'm at Baba's position, which is not explicitly listed here, but based on the rules, maybe I need to move towards the ""is"" block. Let's say I need to go up to get to the ""is"" block. Then move right to 8 steps right and 1 step up, then down to 8 right and 2 down to attach it to the ""ball"" rule. Once that's done, the rule would be ""ball is win"", making the ball a win condition. Then I can move to the ball and touch it to win.

But the path might be blocked. Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 up. The ""win"" is 9 steps right and 2 up, so past that wall. Wait, but maybe creating a new rule allows me to bypass the wall. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"", but I'm already ""baba is you"", so if I can move the ""stop"" property elsewhere. Alternatively, if I can turn the wall into something passable.

Alternatively, maybe the door at 8 right and 2 down can be used. If I can make ""door is open"" or remove the ""stop"" from it. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right and 2 down. Not sure. Let me focus on the ""ball is win"" idea first.

So steps would be: move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, then right to 8 right and 1 step up (but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up). Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and 1 step up, and others further down. So moving right from the ""is"" at 1 step up might be blocked by the wall at 4 right, 1 up. So maybe I need to go around that. But how? If I can push the wall, but walls are usually stop. Wait, the current rules have ""wall is wall"" via the rule at 1 left and 1 up. So walls are stop. So I can't push them. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Instead of moving the ""is"" from 1 step up, maybe use the other ""is"" at 8 right and 1 step up. That's further to the right. Let's see. The ""is"" is at 8 right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" down to 8 right and 2 down where the ""ball"" rule is. Then make ""ball is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block. But to move it, I have to be adjacent to it. So first, move right from my current position to reach that ""is"". But how far am I from there? The current observation doesn't specify Baba's position, but the objects are listed relative to somewhere. Assuming Baba is at the starting point, maybe the initial position is at (0,0), and the objects are positioned relative to that. The ""is"" at 8 right and 1 up would be 8 steps to the right and 1 up from Baba. So to get there, I need to move right 8 times and up once. But there's a wall at 4 right and 2 up, which is on the way. So moving right directly would hit a wall at step 4. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. Let's see the layout:

- The ""is"" at 8 right, 1 up.
- Walls at 4 right, 2 up; 4 right,1 up; etc.
- The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. So maybe moving down from the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up, then right to 8 right,2 down where the ""ball"" rule is. But moving down from 8 right,1 up to 8 right,2 down would require moving down 3 steps. But is there a path? Let's see:

From 8 right,1 up, moving down 1 step would be 8 right,0 up. Then down again to 8 right,-1 up (which is 1 down). Then down to 8 right, -2 up (2 down). There's a wall at 4 right,2 down, but 8 right is further out. So maybe that path is clear. So steps would be:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up. But how many steps up? If Baba is at, say, position (0,0), then moving right 8 and up 1 would get to the ""is"". But there's a wall at 4 right,2 up. Wait, the wall at 4 right,2 up is two steps right and two up from Baba. So moving right 4 steps would hit that wall. So can't go directly right.

Alternative route: Maybe move up first, then right around the wall. For example, move up to 1 step up, then right to 4 steps right (hits the wall), but since the wall is stop, can't move through it. So need to go around. Maybe move up more. If I move up to 2 steps up, then right past the wall at 4 right,2 up. Because the wall is at 4 right,2 up. So from 2 steps up, moving right 4 steps would reach the wall, but maybe I can go around it. Wait, the walls are solid, so can't pass through. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternative idea: Use the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. Let's see where that is. If the ""is"" is 1 step up from Baba, then moving up once gets there. Then, from there, move right to 8 steps right,1 step up. But again, the wall at 4 right,1 step up blocks the path. So can't move right past 4 steps.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe instead of moving the ""is"" to the ball rule, create a new rule elsewhere. For example, make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". The ""win"" rule is at 9 right,1 step up. So if I can move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to ""baba"", then the rule becomes ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule left to 8 right,1 step up, next to the ""is"" rule. Then combine with ""baba"" which is at 1 left and 4 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 5 steps down. So that's quite far.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: Push the ""ball"" to the ""win"" location. If I can make the ball a you or win, then moving it to the win spot would work. But how?

Alternatively, use the door. If the door is a win, then maybe open it. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right,2 down. If I can remove the stop from the door, but I don't have a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, create ""door is key"" or something. Not sure.

Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at 8 right,2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right,1 step up. Maybe if I can move the ""win"" rule left to 8 right,1 step up, then combine with the ""is"" there to make ""ball is win"". Let's see:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at 9 right,1 step up. But to get there, need to go right 9 steps. But there's a wall at 4 right,2 up, but that's two steps up. Maybe moving right past 4, then up? Not sure. Alternatively, move up first to avoid the wall. For example, move up to 2 steps up, then right past 4 steps (but the wall is at 4 right,2 up, which is diagonal from that position). Hmm, not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe focus on moving the ""is"" from 8 right,1 step up to 8 right,2 down. To do that, I need to be adjacent to that ""is"". So from where am I now? If the previous actions led to me being at 1 step up, then moving right to 8 right,1 step up is blocked by the wall. Alternatively, maybe I'm at the position where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 1 left and 5 steps down. That's quite far.

Wait, the observation lists all objects relative to the player's position. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 4 steps down. So if I'm at that position, moving right would take me towards the center. But I'm not sure. This is confusing without knowing my exact position.

Alternatively, think about the immediate nearby objects. There's a ""ball"" 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can push the ball towards the ""win"" location, but the ball is probably stop unless rules say otherwise. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left,1 up, so the ball is next to a wall. If I can make the ball not a stop, then I could move it. For example, if I make ""ball is you"", then I can move the ball. But to do that, I need to create the rule ""ball is you"" by moving the ""is"" next to the ""ball"" and ""you"".

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Alternatively, use the existing ""you"" rule at 1 right and 4 down. Wait, looking back, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps down from the ""baba"" rule's position. So if I can get the ""is"" next to the ""ball"" and the ""you"" rule, then make ""ball is you"". Once that's done, the ball becomes a you, so touching it would make me win. 

So steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 8 right,1 step up. But path blocked. Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 1 step up.

From the ""is"" at 1 step up, move right to reach the ""ball"" which is 1 step right and 1 step up. So from 1 step up, moving right 1 step gets to the ""ball"" location. But there's a wall at 4 right,1 up. Wait, the ""is"" at 1 step up is probably at a different horizontal position. Maybe the ""is"" at 1 step up is adjacent to the ""ball"" 1 step right and 1 step up. Let me visualize:

Assuming the ""is"" is at position (x,1), and the ball is at (x+1,1). So moving right from the ""is"" would reach the ball. Then, if I can move the ""is"" next to the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" is at 1 right,4 down. That's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, use the other ""is"" at 8 right,1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" down to 8 right,2 down where the ""ball"" rule is. Then make ""ball is win"". To move the ""is"" there, need to be adjacent. So from 8 right,1 up, move down to 8 right,0 up, then down to 8 right,-1 up (1 down), then down to 8 right,-2 up (2 down). That path should be clear if there are no walls in between. The walls are at 4 right,2 up; 4 right,1 up; etc. So moving down from 8 right,1 up, past the walls at 4 right, which are to the left. So yes, that path is clear. Once at 8 right,2 down, place the ""is"" next to the ""ball"" rule. Then the rule becomes ""ball is win"", and touching the ball wins.

So the actions would be:

1. Move down from the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up to 8 right,2 down.

But how do I get to the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up in the first place? My current position isn't clear, but based on previous actions, maybe I'm near there. Assuming I can move right and up from my current position to reach that ""is"".

Alternatively, if the previous failed actions were due to not specifying the direction correctly, maybe the correct action now is to move down once to reach the ""is"" block adjacent to the ""ball"" rule.

Given that the last observation had the active rules and objects, and the previous actions were failing due to not being valid, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to get to the ""is"" block next to the ""ball"".

7,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but maybe that's changeable. First, I need to look at the active rules and the objects on the map.

The current active rules are only ""baba is you"". That means whatever I move, it's considered Baba. So if I move towards a WIN object, I can touch it and win, right? But looking at the objects, the WIN is at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me check the map again.

The ball is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. The wall is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. So to get to the WIN, which is further right, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Then the rule 'is' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up, followed by 'win' at 9 steps right. So the path from the ball to the WIN is blocked by the wall at 4 steps right, 2 steps up. Also, there's a 'stop' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which might make certain tiles impossible to cross unless their property is changed.

The user's previous actions were moving up and down, but the system kept defaulting to idle because the actions weren't valid. Maybe they tried to move in directions they couldn't. Let's see. The player is probably where 'baba' is, which is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. So the initial position is somewhere, and the goal is to reach the WIN.

The key here is to manipulate the rules. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you"", moving text blocks to create new rules could help. The 'is' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that 'is' to combine with other rules to make something like ""win is you"" or ""baba is win"". 

Alternatively, looking at the lower part of the map, there's a 'baba' rule at 1 step left and 4 steps down, followed by 'is' and 'you' at 4 steps down. If I can move those to form ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe changing ""you"" to another property. Wait, the current active rule is just ""baba is you"", so maybe the rest are unused text blocks that can be rearranged.

Another idea: The 'door' is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. If I can make the door passable, perhaps by changing its property. But doors are usually passable unless they're stopped. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, so tiles there are stopped. Maybe moving the 'stop' rule away would help.

But how do I move the rules? Since I'm Baba, and I can move objects that aren't stopped. The walls are defined as 'wall', which might be stoppable. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps right, 1 step down. If I can move that 'stop' rule to another location, maybe tiles blocked by stop would become passable.

Wait, the 'ball' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move the 'ball' somewhere, but I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, the 'win' is at 9 steps right, 2 steps up. To reach it, I might need to remove the wall blocking the path. The wall at 4 steps right, 2 steps up is a problem. If I can change that wall's property to something else, like 'flower' or remove it, then I can pass through.

To change the wall's property, I need to use the 'is' rule. There's an 'is' at 8 steps right, 2 steps up. If I can move that 'is' near the wall's rule, which is at 1 step left and 1 step up, then combine them. For example, moving the 'is' to the left of the wall rule to make ""wall is [something]"". Wait, the wall rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move the 'is' next to it, maybe change the wall's property.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at 8 steps right, 2 steps up. If I move that 'is' to be next to the wall rule (1 step left, 1 step up), then combining them would create a new rule. Let's say the wall rule is ""wall is something"", but currently, it's just the wall object. To change it, I need to attach a property to it using 'is'. For example, if I move the 'is' next to the wall rule, making ""wall is stop"", that would make walls stoppable, which they already are. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you"". The other rules are text blocks like 'rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up', which means there's a wall object at that position with the 'wall' property. To change the wall's property, I need to create a rule like ""wall is stop"" or ""wall is push"", etc. But the current rules don't have that. 

So maybe the approach is to create a new rule that makes the ball a win. For example, if I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. The ball is currently at 1 step right and 2 steps up. There's an 'is' at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that 'is' to be next to the ball's rule, which is at... Wait, where is the ball's rule located? Looking at the objects, the ball is an object, and there's a rule `ball` at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. So the ball's rule is separate. 

To create ""ball is win"", I need to take the 'ball' rule and combine it with the 'win' rule using an 'is' between them. The 'is' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that 'is' next to the 'ball' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, then combine them. But how to move the 'is' there?

Since I'm Baba, I can move objects that are not stopped. The 'is' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. To move it down to 8 steps right and 2 steps down, I need to check if there are any stoppers in between. The path from 8 right, 2 up to 8 right, 2 down would involve moving down one step. The tile at 8 right, 2 down is a wall (wall 4 steps right and 3 steps down is at 4 steps right, 3 steps down? Wait, let me parse the objects again.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right
- rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down
- rule `is` 4 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step to the right and 4 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down

So the 'is' at 8 right, 2 up. To move it down to 8 right, 2 down, the path is:

From 8,2 up to 8,2 (current position). Wait, no, the 'is' is at 8 right, 2 up. To move down to 8 right, 2 down, I need to move down two steps. But between 8 right, 2 up and 8 right, 2 down, there's the wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down (wall 4 steps right and 2 steps down). Wait, that's not on the same column. The 'is' is at 8 right, 2 up. To get to 8 right, 2 down, the steps would be down two steps, but the columns are different? No, all positions are relative to the player's position. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. This might be confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is a grid, and each object's position is relative to Baba's starting point. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to visualize. Let's try to sketch it mentally.

Baba's position is at 1 step left and 4 steps down (from the object list: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down). So if we consider Baba's position as (0,0), then:

- The 'is' rule is at (8, 2)
- The 'win' is at (9, 2)
- The wall at 4 steps right and 2 up is at (4, 2)
- The 'stop' rule is at (3, -1)
- The 'door' is at (8, -1)
- The 'ball' rule is at (8, -2)
- The other 'is' and 'you' rules are at (4, -4)

So the player (Baba) is at (-1, -4). The goal WIN is at (9, 2), which is far to the right and up. There's a wall at (4,2) blocking the path. To get past that wall, we need to change its property. For example, making it ""wall is push"" so we can push it, or making it not a wall at all.

Looking at the available text blocks:

- The 'is' at (8,2)
- The 'win' at (9,2)
- The 'wall' rule at (-1,1) (1 step left and 1 step up from Baba's position)
- The 'stop' rule at (3,-1)
- The 'door' at (8,-1)
- The 'ball' rule at (8,-2)
- The 'baba' rule at (-1,-4)
- Another 'is' at (4,-4)
- The 'you' rule at (1,-4)

So the idea is to use the 'is' at (8,2) to create new rules. For example, moving it next to the 'wall' rule at (-1,1) to make ""wall is [something]"". But how to get the 'is' there?

Alternatively, move the 'is' at (8,2) down to (8,0) or (8,-1) to be near other rules. Let's see. From (8,2), moving down one step to (8,1) would land on the 'door' at (8,-1)? Wait, no, the 'door' is at (8,-1), which is two steps down from (8,2). So moving down two steps from (8,2) to (8,0), but there's a wall at (4,2) down to (4,0), but that's a different column. Maybe the path is clear.

If I can move the 'is' from (8,2) down to (8,0), then maybe combine it with the 'ball' rule at (8,-2). But that's two steps down. However, moving down from (8,2) to (8,1) would be one step, and then to (8,0) another step. But what's in those tiles?

At (8,1), there's the 'door' rule. To move the 'is' down, I need to check if the tiles are passable. The 'door' is at (8,-1), so (8,1) is empty? Or is there a wall? The walls are at (4,2), (4,1), (4,0), etc. So (8,1) is likely empty or has the 'door' rule. Since the 'door' rule is a text block, not an object, maybe it's passable. So moving the 'is' down to (8,1) and then to (8,0) should be possible.

Once the 'is' is at (8,0), maybe combine it with the 'ball' rule at (8,-2) by moving it further down. But that might not help. Alternatively, use the 'is' to create a rule like ""ball is win"". The 'ball' rule is at (8,-2), and the 'win' rule is at (9,2). That's quite far. Maybe instead, create ""baba is win"" by moving the 'is' next to the 'baba' rule at (-1,-4). But that would require moving the 'is' from (8,2) all the way left to (-1,-4), which is a long distance and might be blocked by walls.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push objects. Wait, can I push objects? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not stopped. The 'stop' rule is at (3,-1), which affects tiles there. So if I can move the 'stop' rule away, then walls might be pushable. For example, moving the 'stop' rule from (3,-1) to another position, making the tiles it was covering no longer stopped.

But how to move the 'stop' rule? It's a text block, so as long as it's not stopped, I can move it. The 'stop' rule is at (3,-1). To move it, I need to check if that tile is stopped. The 'stop' rule makes certain tiles stopped, but the rule itself is movable unless it's part of a stopped property. Since the current rules don't have anything making the 'stop' rule stopped, I can move it.

So, maybe the plan is:

1. Move the 'stop' rule from (3,-1) to a different position, like (4,-1), so that the tile at (3,-1) is no longer stopped. This would make the wall at (4,-1) passable if it's not stopped.

2. Then, navigate around the walls to reach the 'is' rule at (8,2) and use it to create a new rule, such as ""win is you"" or ""ball is win"".

But how to execute these steps?

First, let's focus on moving the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' is at (3,-1). To move it down to (3,0), I need to check if the path is clear. From (3,-1), moving down to (3,0) would require passing through tiles. Are there any walls or stopped tiles there? The wall at (4,2) is way up, so probably not in the way. Assuming the path is clear, I can move the 'stop' rule down.

But how to move it step by step. Each move is one step in a direction. The 'stop' rule is at (3,-1). To move it right to (4,-1), I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba at (-1,-4), I need to navigate to (3,-1) first. That's a distance of 4 steps right and 3 steps up. But the way is blocked by walls. For example, at (4,2), there's a wall. Wait, maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, use the existing rules to create a path. Since I can move text blocks, maybe rearrange them to create new rules that allow movement.

Another idea: Create a rule that makes the door passable. The door is at (8,-1). If I can make ""door is you"" or ""door is win"", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, create ""door is push"" so I can push it out of the way.

But to do any of this, I need to manipulate the 'is' rule. The 'is' is at (8,2). Let's try to move it down to (8,0) to be near the 'door' rule at (8,-1). From (8,2), moving down two steps to (8,0). Each step down would be:

Step 1: From (8,2) to (8,1) – is there anything there? The 'door' rule is at (8,-1), so (8,1) is empty. So I can move down.

Step 2: From (8,1) to (8,0) – also empty. So move down again.

Now, at (8,0), the 'is' rule is next to the 'door' rule at (8,-1). But that's two steps down. Maybe instead, move the 'is' to (8,-1) by moving down three steps. But that would place it at (8,-1), adjacent to the 'door' rule. Then combine them to make ""door is [something]"".

For example, if I create ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. But how to form that rule. The 'door' rule is at (8,-1), and the 'win' rule is at (9,2). To make ""door is win"", I need to have the 'door' and 'win' text blocks next to each other with an 'is' in between.

But the 'is' is currently at (8,2). If I move it to (8,-1), between the 'door' and 'win', but the 'win' is at (9,2), which is far away. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the 'is' next to the 'baba' rule. The 'baba' rule is at (-1,-4). To get the 'is' there, I need to move it left and up. From (8,2) to (-1,-4) is a distance of 9 steps left and 6 steps down. That's a long way, and likely blocked by walls.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: Use the existing 'you' rule at (1,-4). Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can combine 'baba' with 'win' using the 'is'","

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, but sometimes you have to change the rules. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba (which is me) around. But I need to get to the 'win' object, which is a rule located 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There are walls blocking the path, so I need to manipulate the rules to bypass them.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'ball' to the right and up from where I am. Also, there are several 'is' rules scattered around. The 'stop' rule is 3 steps right and 1 step down, which probably makes whatever it's attached to immovable. The 'door' is 8 steps right and 1 step down, but I don't know if that's useful yet.

Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can grab the 'win' rule and place it somewhere else to make it reachable. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up might be key. If I can form a new rule like ""win is push"" or ""baba is win,"" that could change things. Wait, but how do I combine the existing rules?

First, I need to move the 'is' rule that's 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that next to the 'win' rule, I could create a new rule like ""win is ..."" but I need another property. Alternatively, maybe make ""baba is win"" so that touching the win object makes me win. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to both 'baba' and 'win'.

Looking at the map, there's a 'rule `baba`' at 1 step left and 4 steps down, and a 'rule `is`' at 4 steps down. If I can move that 'is' to be next to 'baba' and 'you', maybe I can change the 'you' to something else. Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""you is win,"" then I would be win. But to do that, I need to manipulate the 'you' rule.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push the 'win' rule to a different location. But the 'win' rule is probably on a 'stop' block? Let me check. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, but the 'win' is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a wall at 4 steps right in various positions, so movement might be blocked.

Another approach: The 'ball' is 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I can move the 'ball' to interact with something. But I'm not sure how the ball is used here. Maybe if I make ""ball is push,"" then I can push it to create a path. But I need to create that rule first.

Wait, the key might be to reach the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that 'is' next to the 'win' rule, I could create a new rule like ""win is [something]"". But what's the something? If I can make ""win is you,"" then touching the win would make me you, which I already am. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would be win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. So, maybe I need to navigate down to that area.

But how do I move the 'is' rule? The 'is' at 8 steps right and 2 steps up is probably in a spot I can reach. Let me visualize the map. If I'm starting somewhere, maybe near the initial position. Let's assume I'm at the position of Baba. The 'rule `baba`' is 1 step left and 4 steps down from the wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe the starting position is around there.

To reach the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up, I might need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 4 steps right in several positions, so I might need to find a path around them. The 'stop' rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down could block movement. Maybe I can push past it if I'm defined as not 'stop', which I currently am because ""baba is you"" and I'm not 'stop'.

So, maybe the plan is to move right towards the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up, then move that 'is' next to the 'win' rule to create ""win is ..."" something. But what's the desired property? If I can make ""win is push,"" then I can push the win block. Or ""win is you,"" so touching it makes me win.

Alternatively, since I'm already 'you', maybe making ""baba is win"" would work. To do that, I need to get the 'is' rule next to both 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. So I need to move down to that area, pick up the 'is' rule, and place it between 'baba' and 'win'.

But how do I move down? The last observation showed that after moving 'down' previously, the 'is' rule moved to 2 steps up. Wait, in the previous steps, when I moved down, maybe the 'is' rule shifted position? I need to track the movement of the rules when I move.

In Baba Is You, when you move an object, you have to push it, and it can only be pushed if it's not defined as 'stop' or similar. The 'is' rule is a text block, so if it's not 'stop', I can push it. So, if I can move towards the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up, push it to a new position, then combine it with other rules.

For example, if I move the 'is' rule next to the 'win' rule and another word, like 'push', then the new rule would be ""win is push"". But I don't see a 'push' rule here. Alternatively, maybe use 'ball' as a property. If I can make ""win is ball"", then touching win would be like touching ball, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, the key might be to use the 'door' rule. The door is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. If I can make ""door is key"" or something, but again, I don't have a key rule. Hmm.

Wait, the 'rule `win`' is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that 'win' rule closer to where I am, maybe I can create a rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to both 'baba' and 'win'.

The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. So, I need to navigate down to that area. Let's see: from the current position, moving down steps would take me towards the lower walls. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down. Maybe I need to go around that.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the 'is' rule from 8 steps right and 2 steps up to be next to 'baba' and 'you'. The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So if I can place 'is' between 'baba' and 'you', that would make ""baba is you"", which is already the case. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I need to change the 'you' to something else. For example, if I can make ""you is win"", then since I'm you, I would be win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'win'. The 'you' is at 1 step right and 4 steps down, and 'win' is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. That's a far distance. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, make ""win is you"", so the win object becomes you. Then touching it would make me win. To create that rule, I need 'win' and 'you' next to an 'is' rule. The 'win' is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up, and 'you' is at 1 step right and 4 steps down. There's a lot of space between them. Maybe I can move the 'is' rule to connect them.

But how to move the 'is' rule? Let's see. The 'is' at 8 steps right and 2 steps up is closer to the 'win' rule. If I can move that 'is' down and left, perhaps next to 'win' and then next to 'you'. But movement is step by step.

Another thought: The 'ball' is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I can make ""ball is win"", then pushing the ball might take me to the win area. But I need to create that rule. To do that, I need to move 'is' next to 'ball' and 'win'. The 'ball' is nearby, so maybe that's a way.

So, steps could be:
1. Move to the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up.
2. Push that 'is' rule down to the area below.
3. Place it next to 'ball' and 'win' to create ""ball is win"".
4. Then, since I'm Baba (you), I can push the ball towards the win area.

But I need to check if the ball can be pushed. If ""ball is win"", does that make it movable? Or does it depend on other rules? Also, the 'win' rule is separate; making ""ball is win"" would change the ball's property but not the win's.

Alternatively, if I can make ""win is push"", then the win object becomes pushable, and I can push it to a different location. But again, how to create that rule.

Wait, another angle: The existing rule is ""baba is you"". If I can change ""you"" to something else, like ""you is win"", then since I'm you, I would be win. So to do that, I need to edit the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps down. If I can move the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'win', that would create ""you is win"".

But moving the 'is' rule there from its current position at 8 steps right and 2 steps up would require a lot of steps. Maybe there's a closer 'is' rule. There's another 'is' at 1 step up and another at 4 steps down.

Wait, the 'is' at 4 steps down is next to the 'baba' and 'you' rules. If I can move that 'is' rule up to connect 'you' and 'win', that would work. So, from the current position, how do I navigate to that 'is' rule at 4 steps down?

The problem is that the path might be blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 4 steps right, which could be a barrier. Maybe I need to go around it by moving in a different direction.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the possible steps clearly:

1. Identify all movable objects: Since ""baba is you"", I can move. The 'is' rules are movable unless they are part of a 'stop' rule. Checking the active rules, there's a 'stop' at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So any text block there is immovable, but others can be moved.

2. Targeted rules to modify: The main goal is to reach the 'win' object. To do that, either make the win object interactable or change my own property to be win.

3. Possible solutions:
   a. Create ""win is you"" so touching win makes me win.
   b. Create ""baba is win"" so I become win.
   c. Create ""push"" rules to move obstacles out of the way.

Looking at the objects, the 'door' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make ""door is key"", but I don't have a key. Alternatively, ""door is open"", but again, not sure.

Another idea: The 'ball' is near the 'win' rule. If I can make ""ball is win"", then pushing the ball might bring me closer to the win area. But I need to create that rule.

To create ""ball is win"", I need to move the 'is' rule next to both 'ball' and 'win'. The 'ball' is at 1 step right and 2 steps up, and 'win' is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. The 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up is between them. If I can move that 'is' rule to the left between 'ball' and 'win', then the rule would be ""ball is win"".

So steps:
1. Move the 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up to the left, between 'ball' and 'win'.
2. This creates ""ball is win"".
3. Now, since the ball is win, pushing it would count as pushing win.
4. If I can push the ball towards the area where I am, maybe that opens a path.

But how to move the 'is' rule there. Let's see, the current position of 'is' is 8 right, 2 up. The ball is at 1 right, 2 up. So the 'is' is 7 steps to the right of the ball. To move it left, I need to push it left, one step at a time, avoiding walls.

The path from 8 right, 2 up to 1 right, 2 up would require moving left 7 times, but there are walls at 4 steps right in various positions. For example, at 4 steps right, there's a wall at various y positions. So moving left from 8 right would pass through 7,6,5,4... but at 4 right, there's a wall at the same y level (2 up?), so maybe that's a barrier.

Looking at the objects:
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right (assuming y=0?)
- etc.

So, when moving left from 8 right, 2 up, the path would go through 7,6,5,4 right steps. At 4 right, there's a wall at 2 up, so I can't go past that. Therefore, I can't move the 'is' rule past the wall at 4 right, 2 up.

This means that approach might not work. So maybe another way.

What if I create ""win is push"" so that the win object can be pushed. Then, if I can push the win object somewhere accessible.

To create ""win is push"", I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'win' and 'push'. But there's no 'push' rule present. However, there's a 'ball' rule. If I make ""win is ball"", then maybe pushing the ball would move the win? Not sure.

Alternatively, use the existing 'rule `win`' at 9 right, 2 up. If I can move that 'win' rule closer to me and attach an 'is' rule to it with a property that allows movement.

Another idea: The 'rule `is`' at 1 step up. If I can move that 'is' down to connect with 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left, 4 down. So moving the 'is' from 1 up to 4 down would require a lot of steps down, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at 4 steps down. That 'is' is next to 'baba' and 'you' rules. If I can move that 'is' up to connect with 'win', but again, path is blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is simpler. Since I'm Baba and can move, perhaps I need to reach the 'win' rule and make it part of my properties. But how?

Wait, the initial rule is ""baba is you"". If I can create ""you is win"", then since I'm you, I become win. To do that, I need to edit the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'win'.

The 'win' is at 9 right, 2 up. The 'you' is at 1 right, 4 down. There's a huge distance between them. Maybe I can't reach them directly.

Alternatively, create a new 'you' rule near the win. For example, make ""win is you"", which would make the win object you. Then, touching it would make me win.

To create ""win is you"", I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'win' and 'you'. The 'win' is at 9 right, 2 up, and 'you' is at 1 right, 4 down. The closest 'is' rule is at 8 right, 2 up. If I can move that 'is' rule down and left to connect 'win' and 'you', but the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the 'is' rule at 4 steps down. If I can move that 'is' up to 2 steps up and connect it to 'win' and 'you', but again, walls are in the way.

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'win' rule to a different location using the 'is' rule. For example, create ""win is left"" or something, but there's no 'left' rule.

Wait, another thought. The 'door' is at 8 right, 1 down. If I can make ""door is key"", then maybe I need a key, but there's no key object. Not helpful.

Alternatively, since the 'ball' is present, maybe ""ball is key"", but again, not sure.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try moving towards the '","

9,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. I'm Baba in a maze-like level where I need to manipulate rules to reach the win condition. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can push or move other objects if they aren't stopped. My goal is usually the ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that by altering the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. But there's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer or make myself something that can ignore the stop, that might help. 

The ball is at 1 step right and 2 steps up, which is in the same row as the ""win"" rule. Maybe if I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, then pushing the ball onto it would make me win? Or perhaps I need to create a new rule like ""ball is win"" so that touching the ball counts as winning. 

There's an ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to that ""is,"" then I could create a new rule by combining them. For example, moving the ""win"" to the left of the ""is"" would make ""something is win."" But what's next to the ""is"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps up? Let me check the objects around there. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, so maybe there's space to move the ""win"" left. 

But wait, I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which is a bit far. The walls are all defined as ""wall,"" which might be STOP unless there's a rule overriding that. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and walls are ""wall,"" unless there's a ""wall is not stop"" rule, they should be stoppable. Let me check the rules again. There's a ""rule wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up,"" which probably means ""wall is [something]"". Wait, the rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the ""rule wall"" must be part of a rule. Let me parse the objects again:

- rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` 1 step up

So the ""rule wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up"" is part of a rule. That must mean ""wall is [something]"". But since it's a ""rule"" object, maybe it's a leftover from a previous state. Wait, maybe the ""rule wall"" is indicating that the wall has a certain property. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps ""wall is stop"" is one of the rules. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules listed are just ""baba is you"". The other ""rule"" objects are probably the tiles where the rules were written, but the actual active rules are the ones parsed from them. So maybe there's an implicit rule from the ""rule wall"" being present. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop,"" that would make walls immovable. But since the active rules only show ""baba is you,"" maybe the walls aren't stop unless specified. Hmm, this is confusing. 

Alternatively, the walls are part of the level layout and can be pushed if they aren't stopped. But the presence of the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down means that any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved. So if a wall is defined as ""stop,"" then it can't be moved. But the active rules don't explicitly say ""wall is stop,"" so maybe they can be pushed. Wait, but in the objects list, there's a ""rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" which probably means the ""stop"" rule is there, making whatever it's attached to stoppable. But how is that applied? Maybe the ""stop"" rule is a global rule that makes any object with ""stop"" a blocker. 

So, to move objects, I need to either avoid the ""stop"" rule or make myself not affected by it. Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects unless they are stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which is a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So that wall is stopped and can't be moved. 

Looking at the ball, it's at 1 step right and 2 steps up. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can get the ball next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can push the ball onto the ""win"" area, making ""ball is win"" a rule. But how? The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule left next to the ""is,"" then combining them would create a new rule ""something is win."" But what's next to the ""is"" at 8 steps right? There's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, so maybe there's space to move the ""win"" rule left. 

To move the ""win"" rule from 9 steps right to 8 steps right (left by 1), I need to be adjacent to it and move left. But where am I currently? The observation doesn't specify my position, but the objects are listed relative to me. For example, the ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up. So I must be to the left of the ball by 1 step and below by 2 steps. Let me assume my position is at (0,0), then the ball is at (1,2). The ""win"" rule is at (9,2). To move the ""win"" rule left, I need to be adjacent to it. If I move up to reach the ""win"" rule's position, but I'm already below it. Wait, maybe I need to move up to get closer. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""win"" rule left by being next to it and moving left. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they are stopped. The ""win"" rule is a text block, so unless it's defined as stop, I can move it. The ""stop"" rule is at a different location, so the ""win"" rule can be moved. 

So, if I move up to the ""win"" rule's position (which is 9 steps right and 2 steps up from me), then move left to place it next to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right. But how do I get there? Let me think about my current position. If the ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up, then moving up twice would get me to the same level as the ball. Then moving right once gets me to the ball. From there, maybe move further right to reach the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" is 9 steps right, so from the ball's position (1 right, 2 up), moving right 8 steps would get to (9,2), which is the ""win"" rule. Then, once I'm next to the ""win"" rule, I can move left once to place it at (8,2), next to the ""is"" rule. That way, combining ""is"" and ""win"" would create a new rule ""something is win."" But what's ""something"" in this case? It would depend on the arrangement. If I place ""win"" to the left of ""is,"" then the rule would be ""win is [something], but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So if I have ""is"" and ""win"" adjacent, maybe the rule becomes ""win is [something]"" but that's unclear. Alternatively, if I place ""win"" next to ""is"" such that ""is"" is between two objects, like [A] IS [B], then moving ""win"" next to ""is"" could create ""A IS win"" if A is to the left of ""is"" and win is to the right. 

But in this case, the ""is"" is at (8,2), and the ""win"" is at (9,2). If I move the ""win"" left to (8,2), then the ""is"" would be at (8,2) and ""win"" at (8,1), but that doesn't align. Maybe I need to arrange them horizontally. Suppose the ""is"" is at (8,2), and I move the ""win"" from (9,2) to (8,2), making them adjacent. Then the rule would be ""win is [something]"" but that's not useful. Alternatively, if there's an object to the left of the ""is,"" say the ball at (1,2), but that's too far. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a rule that makes ""ball is win."" To do that, I need to have ""ball"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""ball"" is at (1,2), the ""win"" is at (9,2), and the ""is"" is at (8,2). So if I can move the ""ball"" to (8,2) next to the ""is"" and ""win,"" then arranging ""ball IS win"" would create the desired rule. But moving the ball requires pushing it, and the ball might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the wall positions: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, which is between the ball's current position (1 right, 2 up) and the rest. So to get the ball further right, I would need to push it past the wall at 4 steps right. But since the wall is a stop object, unless there's a rule saying ""wall is not stop,"" I can't push it. Wait, the active rules only have ""baba is you,"" so the wall's property is ""wall,"" and unless there's a rule defining wall's behavior, it's treated as stop. Therefore, I can't push the wall, meaning I can't push the ball past it. 

This is a problem. The ball is stuck behind the wall at 4 steps right. So maybe the approach of using the ball to reach the win rule isn't feasible. 

Alternative idea: Make Baba into the win object. If I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching the win area would make me win. To do this, I need to use the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""baba"" rule (which is at 1 step left and 4 steps down) next to the ""is"" rule, then I can create ""baba is win."" 

Let's see where the ""baba"" rule is. The rule `baba` is 1 step left and 4 steps down. So from my position (assuming I'm at the ball's position, which is 1 right and 2 up), the ""baba"" rule is to the left and further down. To reach the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up, I need to move right and up. But there are walls blocking the path. 

The wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps up is a problem. To move right past it, I need to push it, but it's a stop. Unless I can change its property. For example, if I can make the wall not stop, then I can push it. To do that, I need a rule like ""wall is not stop."" But there's a rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up, which might be part of a rule. Let me check: ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up"" — this is probably a text block indicating that ""wall is [something]."" Since it's a rule object, it must be part of an active rule. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop,"" then that's why the wall is immovable. But the active rules only show ""baba is you,"" so maybe that rule is inactive or was destroyed. 

Wait, the active rules listed are just ""baba is you."" The other rules are probably text blocks on the map that are part of the level's initial setup but not active unless combined. So the ""rule wall"" might be part of a rule that was broken, like if the original rule was ""wall is stop,"" but it's been split into ""rule wall"" and ""rule stop"" somewhere else. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""baba"" rule to be next to the ""is"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down from me. To get there, I need to move left and down. But I'm currently at the ball's position (assuming), which is 1 right and 2 up. Moving left would take me to (0,2), then further left to reach the ""baba"" rule at (-1,4) — but this depends on the coordinate system. Alternatively, maybe my position is such that the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 4 steps down, meaning I'm to the right and above it. 

This is getting too vague without knowing my exact position. Let me try to map out the coordinates based on the observations. 

Assuming my position is at (0,0):

- The ball is 1 step right and 2 up: (1,2)
- The ""win"" rule is 9 right, 2 up: (9,2)
- The ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up: (8,2)
- The ""rule wall"" at 1 left, 1 up: (-1,1)
- The wall at 4 right, 2 up: (4,2)
- The ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 1 down: (3,-1)
- The wall at 4 right, 1 down: (4,-1)
- The ""door"" rule at 8 right, 1 down: (8,-1)
- The wall at 4 right, 2 down: (4,-2)
- The ""ball"" rule at 8 right, 2 down: (8,-2)
- The ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 4 down: (-1,-4)
- The ""is"" rule at 4 down: (0,-4)
- The ""you"" rule at 1 right, 4 down: (1,-4)

So my position is probably at (1,2) because the ball is there. Wait, the observation says ""Objects on the map"" with positions relative to me. So ""ball 1 step to the right and 2 step up"" means the ball is at (1,2) relative to me. Therefore, my position is (0,0), and the ball is at (1,2).

Now, the ""is"" rule is at (8,2), which is far to the right. To reach it, I need to move right past several walls. The wall at (4,2) is a stop, so I can't push it. Unless I can destroy it by changing its rule. 

Looking at the ""rule wall"" at (-1,1), which is probably part of a destroyed rule like ""wall is stop."" If I can move that ""rule wall"" somewhere else to deactivate it, then the wall at (4,2) might become movable. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that makes the wall not stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop,"" then I can push it. To do that, I need to use the ""is"" rule. Suppose I move the ""not stop"" property somewhere. But there's no ""not stop"" rule on the map. The only relevant rules are ""baba is you,"" ""win is at (9,2),"" and the ""stop"" rule at (3,-1). 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""door"" rule at (8,-1). If I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would make me win. But again, I need to manipulate the ""is"" rule. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""baba"" rule to create a new rule. The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-4). If I can move it to be next to the ""is"" rule at (0,-4), then combining them would create ""baba is [something]."" The ""you"" rule is at (1,-4), so if I move ""baba"" to (0,-4) next to ""is"" and ""you,"" then the rule would be ""baba is you,"" which is already active. Not helpful. 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at (1,-4). If I can move the ""baba"" rule to (0,-4) next to ""is"" and ""you,"" then the rule would be ""baba is you,"" which is redundant. But if I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win,"" maybe. But the ""win"" rule is at (9,2), which is far away. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ""ball."" If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. To do that, I need to arrange ""ball"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at (8,2). The ball is at (1,2). The ""win"" is at (9,2). So there's a wall at (4,2) blocking the path. Unless I can move that wall. 

Alternatively, if I can push the wall at (4,2) to the side, but it's a stop. Unless I can change its property. The ""rule wall"" is at (-1,1), which might be part of the original ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that ""rule wall"" away, then the wall at (4,2) might no longer be stop. For example, if the original rule was ""wall is stop"" made of two text blocks: ""wall"" at (-1,1) and ""stop"" somewhere","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up, and another wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So, moving directly towards the ""win"" might not be possible because of these walls.

There's a ""door"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe I can use that? But I need a key or something to open it. Wait, I don't see a key here. Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""door"" to something else. For example, if I can make ""door IS WIN,"" then stepping on the door would make it a win condition. Or maybe make ""baba IS door"" so that I turn into a door and can move through walls? Not sure.

Looking at the text blocks, there's an ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""win"" or another object, I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to the left of ""win"" would make ""win IS [something]."" But what's next to the ""win"" rule? There's a ball at 1 step right and 2 steps up. Wait, the ""win"" is at 9 right, 2 up. The ball is at 1 right, 2 up. So maybe I can move the ""is"" from 8 right, 2 up to be next to the ""win"" at 9 right, 2 up. If I do that, I could create ""win IS [something else]."" But what's next to the ""win""? The ""ball"" is to the left. If I can make ""win IS PUSH"" or ""win IS YOU,"" then maybe I can interact with it differently.

Alternatively, there's a ""baba"" text block at 1 left, 4 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there, I could make ""baba IS WIN,"" so that touching baba makes me win. But how do I get to that ""baba"" rule? It's 4 steps down from the current position. Let me check the current position. The player (Baba) is probably at the starting point, but the exact position isn't specified. Wait, the objects listed don't include Baba's position, but the active rules are ""baba is you,"" so the player is Baba. The other objects are walls, rules, ball, door, etc.

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 1 step left and 4 steps down. Also, a rule `is` at 4 steps down. And a rule `you` at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So if I can move the `is` at 4 steps down next to the `baba` at 1 left, 4 down, I could make ""baba IS YOU"" again, but that's already a rule. Or maybe move the `is` next to the `you` to make something else. Hmm.

Another approach: The ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 1 down. If I can make ""stop IS NOTHING,"" then those walls wouldn't block me. But how to do that? I need to find the ""nothing"" text block, but I don't see it here. Maybe create a new rule like ""stop IS PUSH"" so that I can push past them. But I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Looking at the available rules: there's ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""door,"" ""ball."" The ""ball"" is at 8 right, 2 down. Maybe if I make ""ball IS YOU,"" then I can control the ball. But then I have to reach the ball first. The ball is 8 steps right and 2 down from the current position. But there are walls in the way. For example, wall at 4 right, 2 down, and others. So moving right directly isn't possible.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 2 up. If I move that ""is"" down to where the ""ball"" is, so 8 right, 2 down, then place it next to the ""ball"" to make ""ball IS YOU."" Once that's done, I can move the ball to the ""win"" position. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? The player (Baba) needs to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule to move it. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up. So from Baba's position, which I'm not sure where exactly, but assuming he's somewhere near the starting point. Let's say he's at position (0,0). The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up, which would be (8,2). To move it down to (8,3) or (8,1), the player would have to move right 8 times and up 2, then down to 3 or 1. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 right, 2 up there's a wall. So maybe that path is blocked.

Alternatively, there's another ""is"" rule at 4 steps down. If I can move that one. The ""is"" at 4 down is at 1 step right and 4 down. Wait, the rule `is` is at 4 steps down. So coordinates might be (1,4) for the ""is"" and (1 step right and 4 steps down) for the ""you"" rule. Maybe the player is near there? Not sure.

Another idea: The ""door"" is at 8 right, 1 down. If I can make ""door IS WIN,"" then stepping on the door would make it a win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door."" The ""door"" is at 8 right, 1 down. The ""is"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. So moving the ""is"" down from (8,2) to (8,1) would place it next to the ""door."" Then create ""door IS WIN."" Once that's done, moving to the door would make it the win condition. But how to get the ""is"" there?

The player needs to move the ""is"" from (8,2) to (8,1). To do that, the player has to be adjacent to the ""is"" and move it down. Assuming the player is somewhere around there, maybe they can move right to 8, then up to 2, then down to 1. But along the way, at 4 right, 2 up there's a wall. So the path might be blocked. Unless there's a way to move the wall.

Wait, there's a ""wall IS"" rule at 1 left and 1 up. Maybe if I can change that. For example, make ""wall IS NOTHING,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" block. Alternatively, ""wall IS PUSH"" so that they can be pushed. But again, I need to create that rule.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Active rule: Baba is You.
- Need to reach Win, but blocked by walls.
- Available text blocks: is, win, wall, door, ball.
- Possible actions: move towards Win, manipulate text blocks to create new rules.

Maybe the key is to turn the door into a win. So, move the ""is"" next to the door. The door is at 8 right, 1 down. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up. So the player needs to move the ""is"" down one step to 8 right, 1 down. To do that, the player must be adjacent to the ""is"" and move it. Assuming the player can get to (8,2), then move down.

But how to get to (8,2)? The player's starting position isn't clear, but there's a rule `baba` at 1 left, 4 down. Maybe the player is there. From (1 left, 4 down), moving right and up would be needed. But there are walls at 4 right, 2 up, etc.

Alternatively, use the ""ball"" to push walls. If I can make the ball a pushable object. For example, create ""ball IS PUSH."" Then, if I move the ball into a wall, it would push the wall. But to do that, I need to create that rule first. The ""is"" rules are scattered, but maybe move one to the ball's location.

The ball is at 8 right, 2 down. There's an ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up. If I move that ""is"" down to 8 right, 2 down, next to the ball, then create ""ball IS PUSH."" Then, use the ball to push walls out of the way.

Once the ball is pushable, push it towards the ""win"" location. Then, maybe step over the pushed ball to reach the win. But this requires multiple steps: moving the ""is"" to the ball, creating ball IS PUSH, then pushing the ball, then moving to the win.

Alternatively, make the win a pushable object, but that doesn't help much.

Another angle: The ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 1 down. If I can make ""stop IS NOTHING,"" then the stop (which is a wall) becomes nothing, allowing passage. But again, need the ""nothing"" rule, which isn't present.

Wait, the rules only include the ones listed. So maybe create a rule that neutralizes stop. For example, ""stop IS YOU"" – but that would make the stop a you, which might not help. Or ""stop IS WIN,"" but that's not useful.

Alternatively, create ""baba IS STOP,"" making Baba a stop, which would prevent movement. That's bad.

Hmm. Let's think of the simplest solution. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 2 up. If I can create a rule that makes Baba able to move past walls. For example, ""wall IS NOTHING."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and then set it to nothing. But ""nothing"" isn't an object here. Unless there's a way to redefine ""wall.""

Alternatively, ""wall IS PUSH,"" so that walls can be pushed. Then, use the ball to push the wall blocking the path. But again, need to create that rule.

Looking at the available ""is"" rules: one at 8 right, 2 up, another at 4 down (1 right, 4 down). Maybe use the one at 4 down. If I move that ""is"" to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 up, then create ""wall IS PUSH."" Let's see:

Current ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. If I move the ""is"" from 1 right, 4 down to be next to the ""wall"" at 1 left, 1 up, that would require moving left and up, but the player's position isn't clear. This might not be feasible.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" at 8 right, 2 up down to 8 right, 1 up, then to 8 right, 1 down, placing it next to the ""door."" Then create ""door IS WIN."" That seems possible. Let's map this out:

1. Move the ""is"" from (8,2) down to (8,1). To do this, the player must be at (8,2) and move down. But is there a path? The player's position is unknown, but assuming they can reach (8,2), they can move down.

2. Once ""is"" is at (8,1), next to the ""door,"" create the rule ""door IS WIN."" Now, stepping on the door would make it the win condition.

3. Then, navigate to the door at (8,1 down). But on the way, there's a wall at 4 right, 2 down. If the wall is pushable (if we made ""wall IS PUSH""), then we can push it aside using the ball. But this requires creating ""wall IS PUSH"" first, which requires another ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, if we've already made ""door IS WIN,"" then maybe we can move past the walls by making Baba immune to stops. For example, ""stop IS NOTHING."" But again, no ""nothing"" rule.

This seems like a possible path, but it requires multiple steps and moving several text blocks. Let's outline it step by step:

Step 1: Move the ""is"" at (8,2) down to (8,1) next to the ""door.""

Step 2: Create ""door IS WIN.""

Step 3: Move to the door at (8,1) down. The path might be blocked by walls, but if we can push them, that's better. Alternatively, if we can make Baba able to ignore walls, like ""wall IS YOU"" or something, but that's risky.

Alternatively, after making ""door IS WIN,"" just walk to the door. The door is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. The player would need to move right 8 times and down once. But there are walls at 4 right, 2 down, etc. Unless those walls can be moved.

Another idea: Use the ball to push the wall. If we can make the ball pushable, then push it into the wall, maybe creating a path.

To make the ball pushable:

1. Move the ""is"" from (8,2) down to (8,2 down), which is (8,3). Then create ""ball IS PUSH.""

But the ball is at (8,2 down), so moving ""is"" there would create ""ball IS PUSH.""

Once the ball is pushable, push it from (8,2 down) towards the wall at (4 right, 2 down). Wait, the wall at 4 right, 2 down is directly in the path. If we push the ball from (8,2 down) towards left, it might not help. Alternatively, push it towards the wall to push the wall out of the way.

But the wall is at 4 right, 2 down. The ball is at 8 right, 2 down. If we push the ball left, it would move towards 7 right, 2 down, etc., but that doesn't help with the wall at 4 right.

Hmm. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Another angle: The ""baba"" text block is at 1 left, 4 down. There's an ""is"" at 1 right, 4 down. So if I move that ""is"" next to the ""baba"" at 1 left, 4 down, I can create ""baba IS YOU"" again, but that's redundant. Or ""baba IS WIN,"" making touching Baba a win. That could work!

So steps:

1. Move the ""is"" at 1 right, 4 down to be next to the ""baba"" at 1 left, 4 down. This would require moving the ""is"" left by 1 step to be at 0 right, 4 down (assuming the ""baba"" is at 1 left, which is -1 right, 4 down). So moving the ""is"" from (1,4) to (-1,4), placing it next to ""baba.""

2. Create the rule ""baba IS WIN."" Now, touching Baba (which is the player) would make them win.

3. Then, just stand still, and the game would end in victory because the player is Baba, and the rule is ""baba is win.""

This seems like a possible solution. Let's check if this is feasible.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 4 down. To move it left to be next to ""baba"" at 1 left, 4 down (which is (-1,4)), the player needs to be adjacent to the ""is"" and move it left. Assuming the player is at (0,4), they can move left to (1,4) to get to the ""is,"" then move left again to (-1,4), placing it next to ""baba."" Once there, the rule becomes ""baba IS WIN,"" so the player wins immediately.

This seems like a valid approach. So the actions needed are:

1. Move left from the player's position to reach the ""is"" at (1,4).

2. Move left again to place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" at (-1,4).

3. Now, the rule ""baba IS WIN"" is active, so standing still wins.

So the sequence of actions would be: left, left.

But the player's exact starting position isn't specified. However, given the objects listed, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down, and the ""is"" is at 1 right, 4 down. So the distance between them is 2 steps left. Therefore, the player must be able to move from their starting position to (1,4), then to (-1,4).

Assuming the player can move freely (without being blocked by walls), this would work. But are there walls in between? Let's check the objects:

Looking at the objects:

- There's a wall at 4 steps right and various positions, but none between 1 left and 1 right at 4 down. The walls are at 4 right, 1 up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 down; etc. So the path from 1 right,4 down to 1 left,4 down should be clear, as there are no walls listed in between.

Therefore, the solution is to move the ""is"" rule two steps left to be next to ""baba,"" creating ""baba IS WIN,"" thereby winning the game.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but that might change if I can alter the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map:

1. There's a ball located 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up from my current position.
2. There are several walls and rules scattered around. The ""win"" object is at 10 steps right and 2 steps up.
3. There's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" I can move this rule block if it's not stopped.
4. The ""door"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step down, but it's behind a ""stop"" wall (3 steps right, 1 step down). So I can't go through that directly.
5. Lower down, at 4 steps down, there's a ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `is`,"" and ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps right and 4 steps down. Maybe I can combine these to change my properties.

The main challenge seems to be getting past the walls to reach the ""win"" object. The ""win"" is directly to the right above the ball. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that wall, maybe by altering its rule, that could help. The ""rule `wall`"" is 1 step up, but I need to see if I can reach it.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make the ball act as a win condition. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would be the solution. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block that's 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I move that to the ball's location and combine it with ""ball,"" I can form ""ball is win.""

Let me check the positions again. The ""rule `is`"" is at 1 right, 2 up. My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm starting at Baba's position, which is probably near the lower part with the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" blocks. To reach the ""rule `is`"" block, I need to move up and right. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 5 steps right, there are walls at various positions, including 2 steps down. So moving directly right might be blocked by the walls.

Wait, the map has walls at 4 steps right and 1 step down, 5 steps right and 1 step down, etc. Maybe I need to find a path around these walls. If I move up first, then right, avoiding the walls. Let's see:

Current position (assuming starting at Baba's position, which is likely near the bottom left with the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps down and 1 step right). To get to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 right and 2 up, I might need to move up twice and right once. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. Hmm, that wall is blocking the direct path.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""rule `is`"" block that's 8 steps right and 2 step up. Wait, no, in the current observation, after some movements, the ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step right and 2 step up. The other ""rule `is`"" was further right but maybe moved.

Another approach: To make the ball the win condition. To do that, I need to create ""ball is win."" For that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ball and the ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" is at 10 steps right and 2 steps up, which is far away. Maybe there's another way.

Wait, the existing ""win"" rule is at 10 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""win"" rule closer to the ball, but it's probably blocked by walls. Alternatively, change the ""win"" rule's position. But I need to move the ""rule `is`"" to attach it to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a door or stop by rewriting the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is door"" or ""baba is stop,"" that might help. Let's look at the lower part. There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps down, ""rule `is`"" at 1 right and 4 steps down, and ""rule `you`"" at 2 right and 4 steps down. If I can move the ""rule `is`"" there and combine it with ""baba"" to change my properties.

But I'm not sure. Let me recap the steps:

1. Current active rule: Baba is You, so I can move around and manipulate text blocks.
2. Need to reach the ""win"" object, but it's blocked by walls.
3. Possible solutions:
   a. Move walls out of the way by altering their rules.
   b. Create a new rule that makes the ball the win condition.
   c. Change Baba's properties to bypass obstacles (e.g., become a stop, which can't be moved, but since I'm you, maybe that's not useful).

Let's focus on option b. To make ""ball is win,"" I need to have the text blocks ""ball,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" in the correct order. The ""win"" is already present at 10 right, 2 up. The ""ball"" is at 2 right, 2 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to between the ball and the win, forming ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win.

To move the ""is"" rule from 1 right, 2 up to the ball's position (2 right, 2 up), I need to move it right by 1 step. But I can only move objects that are not defined as STOP. Looking at the map, are there any STOP objects near the ""is"" rule? The ""stop"" rule is at 4 right, 1 down, which is far away. So the ""is"" rule should be movable.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule (1 right, 2 up) to the ball's position (2 right, 2 up). To do that, move right once.
2. Once the ""is"" is next to the ball, the rule becomes ""ball is,"" and then if I can append ""win"" next to it, it would form ""ball is win."" But ""win"" is already at 10 right, 2 up. So maybe after placing ""is"" next to the ball, I need to move the ""win"" rule closer. However, the ""win"" is far away, blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" rule can be moved. The ""rule `win`"" is at 10 right, 2 up. If I can move that to be next to the ball, then ""ball is win"" would be formed. But moving the ""win"" rule would require moving it left past several steps, which might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's another ""is"" rule further right that I can use. Wait, in the current observation, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. But that's probably part of the ""win"" rule's setup. Not sure.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step down. If I can make Baba into a door, then stepping on the door might open it. But how? The ""rule `door`"" is already present; maybe I can link it to Baba.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you."" If I can create ""baba is door,"" then Baba would become a door. But doors can be pushed unless there's a STOP rule. Let me check if there's a STOP rule nearby. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 right, 1 down. So if I make Baba a door, I can push him through the door? Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, if I make ""you is door,"" then since I'm You, I would become a door. Then, maybe I can walk through other doors or something. But the goal is to reach the win condition.

Back to the original idea: Moving the ""is"" rule to the ball. If I can do that, then ""ball is [something]"" can be formed. The ""win"" is already a rule, so if I can place ""is"" between ball and win, it would make ""ball is win.""

So step-by-step:

- Move right once to get the ""is"" rule next to the ball (from 1 right, 2 up to 2 right, 2 up).
- Then, move the ""win"" rule left to be next to the ""is"" and ball. But the ""win"" is at 10 right, 2 up, which is 8 steps to the left from the ball. That's a lot of steps, and there are walls in between (like at 5 right, 2 up). So moving the ""win"" left manually isn't feasible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Wait, after moving the ""is"" to the ball, maybe I can create a new ""win"" rule nearby. But I don't have another ""win"" block; the existing one is at 10 right.

Hmm, perhaps I need to use the ""rule `is`"" at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" to the ball's location and combine it with ""win,"" but that's too far.

Another possibility: The ""rule `ball`"" is at 9 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that up, but again, walls are in the way.

Wait, looking at the current positions:

- The ""ball"" is at 2 right, 2 up.
- The ""win"" is at 10 right, 2 up.
- There's a wall at 5 right, 2 up. So between the ball and the win, there's a wall at 5 right, making it impossible to walk straight.

Maybe the solution is to destroy the wall by changing its rule. The wall is defined by ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up."" If I can remove that rule or change it, the wall would disappear. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule somewhere else.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that rule block away, the wall at 5 right, 2 up (which is created by ""wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up"") would no longer exist. Wait, the wall is at 4 steps right and 2 step up. The ""rule `wall`"" that creates it is at 1 step left and 1 step up. So if I move the ""rule `wall`"" block, the wall at 4 right, 2 up would stop being a wall.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""rule `wall`"" block (currently at 1 left, 1 up) to a different position, thereby removing the wall at 4 right, 2 up.
2. Then, go around the wall to reach the ""win"" object.

But how to move the ""rule `wall`"" block. It's located 1 step left and 1 step up from my current position. If I can move right twice to get to it, then move it somewhere else.

Assuming my current position is near the lower part where the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"" are, let's say I'm at (0,0). Then:

- The ""rule `wall`"" is at (-1,1).
- To reach it, I need to move left once and up once. But I'm ""baba is you,"" so I can move. However, moving left from (0,0) might be possible unless there's a STOP rule blocking. Looking at the map, the ""stop"" rule is at 4 right, 1 down, which is far away. So left movement should be allowed.

So:

1. Move left once to reach (-1,1) where the ""rule `wall`"" is.
2. Then, move the ""rule `wall`"" block to a new position, say, next to the existing ""is"" rule at (1 right, 2 up). But I need to see if that helps.

Wait, moving the ""rule `wall`"" block would change the definition of walls. If I move it to a different location, it might create a wall elsewhere or remove it. The original wall at 4 right, 2 up is because of the ""rule `wall`"" at 1 left, 1 up. If I move that rule, the wall at 4 right, 2 up would cease to exist. That's beneficial.

So steps:

- Move left to get to the ""rule `wall`"" block.
- Pick it up and move it to a different position, say, next to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 right, 2 up. This would create a new wall at that position, but maybe that's useful elsewhere.

Once the original ""rule `wall`"" is moved, the wall at 4 right, 2 up is gone. Then I can path through to the ""win"" at 10 right, 2 up.

Alternatively, after removing that wall, I can go right past 4 right and proceed to the ""win"" object.

But how to execute this:

First, move left to the ""rule `wall`"" at (-1,1). Then move it to a new location. For example, move right twice to (1,1), placing the ""rule `wall`"" there. This would create a new wall at 1 right, 1 up, which might block a different path, but the original wall at 4 right, 2 up is removed.

Once that's done, I can move right past 4 right, avoiding the wall, and reach the ""win"" at 10 right, 2 up.

But how to move the ""rule `wall`"" block. The action sequence would be:

1. Move left (to reach the ""rule `wall`"").
2. Move the block right to a new position.

But the problem is that the actions are single steps. The user asked for the next action, not the entire sequence. So the first action should probably be to move left to get to the ""rule `wall`"" block.

Alternatively, maybe the immediate next action is to move left.

Looking at the current observation, the ""rule `wall`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I'm at the same position as Baba, which is likely at 1 step left and 4 steps down (from the rule `baba` there), then moving up once would get me to the ""rule `wall`"" at 1 left, 1 up.

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. So if I'm at that position, moving up once would take me to 1 left, 3 steps down, then up again to 1 left, 2 steps down, then up to 1 left, 1 step down? Wait, directions might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify the coordinate system.

Assuming that the directions are relative to the player's position. For example, ""up"" would decrease the y-coordinate, and ""right"" would increase the x-coordinate. So if the ""rule `wall`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from Baba's position, that means Baba is at (x, y), and the rule is at (x-1, y-1).

So to reach the ""rule `wall`"", the player needs to move left (decrement x) and up (decrement y) once.

But in the current observation, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so movement is possible.

Therefore, the next action should be to move left to get to the ""rule `wall`"" block, then move it to remove the wall blocking the path to the ""win"" object.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other text blocks to change the rules. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but sometimes you have to change what counts as a win.

Looking at the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 10 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But that's probably behind a bunch of walls. Also, there's a ""door"" at 9 steps right and 1 step down, and a ""ball"" at 9 right and 2 down. Hmm. 

The key here might be to move the ""win"" text block closer or to make the door a win. Since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't STOP, I need to see where I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" rules. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move that ""is"" next to something else, maybe I can create a new rule. Also, the ""win"" is at 10 right, 2 up. If I can push the ""win"" rule closer, or maybe change the ""door"" to be a win. 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 9 right, 1 down. To move it, I might need to push it left or right. Since the ""stop"" rule is at 4 right, 1 down, that's an immovable wall. So maybe pushing the door from the left? Let's see. The door is 9 right, 1 down. To move it left, I would need to be adjacent to it and push it left. But is there a path? Current position of Baba isn't clear from the observation, but the last action was ""left,"" which might have moved Baba left. Let me check the previous steps.

In the current observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps down. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is listed as ""rule `baba` 4 steps down"" and then there's another ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So the actual Baba entity is likely the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is at 4 steps down. But I need to confirm if that's the case.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually the Baba that has the ""YOU"" rule attached. Here, the active rules are just ""baba is you,"" so the player is Baba, and he can move around to push text blocks. So the position of Baba is where the ""rule `baba`"" is located, which is 4 steps down. But how is that positioned relative to other objects?

Looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps down, and there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 4 steps down, and ""rule `you`"" at 2 steps right and 4 steps down. So if Baba is at the same position as the ""rule `baba`"" block, he's standing at 4 steps down. The walls around there are at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe he's in a corridor.

The goal is to get to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" is at 10 right, 2 up. But there are walls at 5 right, 2 up and others blocking the path. Alternatively, the ""door"" at 9 right, 1 down. If I can turn the door into a win, that might be a way. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door. 

So perhaps the plan is to move the ""win"" rule from 10 right, 2 up to 9 right, 2 up (next to the door), and then the door would become the win condition. Then, if I can reach the door, I win. 

To move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 2 up. The current position of Baba (the rule `baba` block) is at 4 steps down. Let's see the coordinates. Let me try to visualize the grid.

Assuming that the starting point is (0,0), but the exact coordinates aren't given, but the directions are relative. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 2 step up would be at position (1,2). The ball is at (2,2), wall at (5,2), etc. The ""win"" is at (10,2). The ""door"" is at (9,1). The ""rule `baba`"" is at (4, -1) if steps down is negative y-axis. 

Baba needs to move towards the ""win"" rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" at (1,2) to (9,2), then combining with ""win"" at (10,2) would make ""door IS WIN"", but the door is at (9,1), not (9,2). Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule left. To move the ""win"" rule left, I need to be to the left of it and push it left. The ""win"" is at (10,2). The closest empty spot to the left would be (9,2), which is occupied by the ""door"" rule. Wait, the ""door"" is at (9,1), which is one step down. So (9,2) is empty? Let me check the objects:

At 9 steps right and 2 steps down: wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, the wall is at 5 right, 2 down. The ""rule `ball`"" is at 9 right, 2 down. So (9,2) is occupied by the ball's rule. Wait, no, the ""rule `ball`"" is at 8 right, 2 down. Wait, the current observation says:

rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down

So (8,2) for the ball's rule. The ""door"" is at (9,1). So the ""win"" is at (10,2). To move the ""win"" left to (9,2), but (9,2) is empty? Let me check all objects again:

Looking at the objects:

- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 2 step up: (1,2)
- ball 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2)
- wall 5 steps to the right and 2 step up: (5,2)
- rule `is` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up: (9,2)
- rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 2 step up: (10,2)
- rule `wall` 1 step up: (0,1)
- wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up: (5,1)
- wall 5 steps to the right: (5,0)
- rule `stop` 4 steps to the right and 1 step down: (4,-1)
- wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step down: (5,-1)
- rule `door` 9 steps to the right and 1 step down: (9,-1)
- wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (5,-2)
- rule `ball` 9 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (9,-2)
- wall 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down: (5,-3)
- rule `baba` 4 steps down: (0,-4) assuming steps down is negative y
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 4 steps down: (1,-4)
- rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down: (2,-4)
- wall 5 steps to the right and 4 steps down: (5,-4)

So the ""win"" is at (10,2). To move it left, I need to be at (9,2) and push it. But (9,2) has the ""rule `is`"" at (9,2). So maybe first move that ""is"" rule out of the way. The ""is"" at (9,2) can be moved if it's not STOP. Since it's a rule, it's movable unless there's a STOP property. Looking at the active rules, the only STOP is at (4,-1). So the ""is"" at (9,2) can be moved.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""is"" at (9,2) to the left, say to (8,2), allowing the ""win"" to be moved to (9,2).
2. Then move the ""win"" from (10,2) to (9,2), creating ""door IS WIN"" if placed next to the door at (9,-1). Wait, but the ""door"" is at (9,-1), which is one step down. So placing ""win"" at (9,2) next to the door wouldn't create a vertical rule. Rules are horizontal, I think. So to make ""door IS WIN"", the ""is"" needs to be between ""door"" and ""win"", either horizontally or vertically. 

Alternatively, create a rule like ""door IS WIN"" by placing ""door"" next to ""is"" and then ""win"". For that, maybe move the existing ""is"" at (1,2) to be next to the door. But the door is at (9,-1), which is quite far. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (9,2) to connect the door at (9,-1) with the win at (9,2). Wait, but that's vertically. Not sure if rules can be vertical. Probably horizontal. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: since Baba is ""you"", if I can push the ""door"" to a position where I can step on it, and if the door is made into a win, then touching it would win. 

But to make the door a win, we need a rule ""door IS WIN"". To create that, we need ""door"" adjacent to ""is"" and ""win"". 

The existing ""win"" is at (10,2). The ""door"" is at (9,-1). The ""is"" is at (9,2). If we can move the ""is"" from (9,2) down to (9,-1), then place ""win"" next to the door. 

But how to move the ""is"" from (9,2) to (9,-1)? That would require moving it down multiple steps, passing through (9,1), but there's a ""rule `stop`"" at (4,-1), which is not in the same column. So moving down from (9,2) to (9,1) is possible if there's no STOP there. The object at (9,1) is the ""rule `door`"", which is movable. So yes, we can move the ""is"" down through (9,2) → (9,1) → (9,0) → (9,-1), etc. 

Once the ""is"" is at (9,-1), adjacent to the ""door"" at (9,-1), then we can place the ""win"" rule next to the door. But the ""win"" is at (10,2). To get it to (9,-1), that's a long move. Alternatively, move the ""door"" to be next to the ""win"" once the ""is"" is in place. 

This seems quite involved. Maybe a simpler approach: use the existing ""is"" at (1,2) to create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""X IS WIN"". But what X? The closest objects are ball and wall. 

If I can make ""ball IS WIN"", then stepping on the ball would win. The ball is at (2,2). The ""win"" is at (10,2). The ""is"" is at (1,2). So if I move the ""is"" from (1,2) to (2,2), next to the ball, then create ""ball IS WIN"" by placing ""win"" next to it. But the ""win"" is at (10,2), so I need to move it left. 

Alternatively, move the ""win"" left step by step. To move the ""win"" from (10,2) to (9,2), we need to be adjacent to it and push. The ""is"" at (9,2) is in the way. So first move the ""is"" at (9,2) to the left to (8,2). Then move the ""win"" to (9,2). Now, at (9,2) we have ""win"" and at (8,2) there's the ball's rule. Then, if we can get the ""is"" from (1,2) to (9,2), but that's a long way. 

This is getting too complex. Maybe focus on moving the ""win"" closer. Let's try:

1. Move the ""is"" at (9,2) to the left to (8,2). To do this, Baba needs to be at (8,2) and push the ""is"" left. But where is Baba currently?

The current observation lists ""rule `baba` 4 steps down"". Assuming steps down is negative y, so Baba is at (0, -4). He needs to move towards the upper part of the map. 

From (0,-4), moving up would get him to (0,-3), then (0,-2), etc., but there are walls at (5, y) positions. Maybe a better path is to move right. 

But first, let's see the path. From (0,-4), moving right to (1,-4) is possible if there's no wall. The objects at 1 step right and 4 steps down are ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"". So (1,-4) has a text block. To move right, Baba would have to be at (0,-4) and push the text block at (1,-4) to the right. But the text block at (1,-4) is ""is"" and ""you"", which are separate? Or is it a single rule block? 

In Baba Is You, each text block is a separate object. So ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 4 steps down"" is at (1,-4), and ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 4 steps down"" is at (2,-4). So from (0,-4), moving right to (1,-4) would allow pushing the ""is"" rule to (2,-4), but there's already a ""you"" rule at (2,-4). Can you stack rules? I think you can place them adjacent. 

But the goal is to get to the upper part. Maybe instead, move the ""baba"" rule block (which is the same as the player) to a position where he can interact with the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. 

Alternatively, since Baba is ""you"", perhaps he can push the ""door"" if it's not stopped. The ""door"" is at (9,-1), and there's a ""rule `stop`"" at (4,-1), which is in a different column. So the door can be moved. 

If I can move the door to a position where it's next to the ""win"" rule, then if ""door IS WIN"", stepping on it would win. To do that:

1. Move the ""is"" from (9,2) down to (9,-1), adjacent to the door.
2. Then move the ""win"" from (10,2) to (9,2), which is now next to the ""is"" at (9,2) and the door at (9,-1). Wait, but they're not adjacent. This might not work.

This is tricky. Maybe another angle: the existing ""rule `baba`"" is at (4 steps down). If I can change the ""baba"" rule to have a different property, like ""baba IS WIN"", then touching Baba would make him the win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule. 

The ""baba"" rule is at (0,-4) assuming steps down is negative. The ""win"" is at (10,2). That's a long way. Alternatively, move the ""baba"" rule up. But ""baba"" is a rule block that can be moved if it's not stopped. Since there's no ""stop"" on it, I can push it. 

So, if I can move the ""baba"" rule block to be next to the ""win"" rule, then create ""baba IS WIN"". For example:

1. Move the ""baba"" rule from (0,-4) up to (0,-3), then (0,-2), (0,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc., but there are walls at (5,y) positions. So maybe move right instead. 

From (0,-4), move right to (1,-4) by pushing the ""is"" rule there to (2,-4). Then move right again to (2,-4), pushing the ""you"" rule to (3,-4). Continue moving right until reaching (5,-4), which is a wall. So the farthest right he can get is (4,-4), but there's no objects there. 

Alternatively, move up from (0,-4) to (0,-3), avoiding walls. But the path up might be blocked by walls at (5,y). 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest viable solution is to move the ""win"" rule left to be next to the door, making the door the win condition. To do that:

1. Move the ""is"" at (9,2) left to (8,2).
2. Then move the ""win"" from (10,2) to (9,2).
3. Now, at (9,2) we have ""win"", and the door is at (9,-1). To connect them, we need an ""is"" between them. But the ""is"" is now at (8,2). If we move it down to (9,1), then place it between the door and win? 

Alternatively, move","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I, Baba, can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case or if any rules have changed that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball and a win rule both located 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. The win rule is at 10 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, the ball is between me (Baba) and the win rule. But there's a wall at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Hmm, so moving straight right might not work because of that wall. 

Maybe I can manipulate the rules to bypass the wall. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the wall, I might be able to change the wall's property. For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" then walls would be stop, which I can't move through. But wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move text blocks unless they're stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is a bit far. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball into the win condition. There's a ""win"" rule at 10 steps to the right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. The ball is currently 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up from me. So I need to move towards it. But there's a wall in the way at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I move that ""is"" rule to the ball's position (2 steps right and 2 steps up), then I can create a new rule like ""ball is win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move objects unless they're stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, so I can pick it up and move it. 

So my plan is: move the ""is"" rule from (1 right, 2 up) to (2 right, 2 up) where the ball is. Once I place the ""is"" next to the ball, I can write ""ball is win."" Then, moving to the ball would make me win. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? The current position of ""is"" is 1 right and 2 up. To get to the ball's position (2 right, 2 up), I need to move right once. Wait, but I'm already at the same vertical level (2 steps up). So if I'm at position (x, y), and the ""is"" is 1 step right and 2 steps up, moving right once from my current position would place me next to the ""is"" rule. Then I can push it further right to the ball's location. 

Wait, maybe I need to move myself to the ""is"" rule first. Let me check the starting position. The initial position isn't specified, but assuming I'm at the original Baba's position, which might be at the bottom left. But looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 4 steps down. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the rule `baba` is at 4 steps down, and `is` is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. So maybe I'm at the position of the original Baba rule? Or perhaps I'm a separate entity. This is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the player's position is fixed, and the objects are relative. The key is to find the ""is"" rule near the ball and the win condition. The ""win"" rule is far to the right, blocked by walls. The ball is closer. If I can make the ball the win condition, then reaching it would solve the level. 

So steps: 
1. Move the ""is"" rule from (1 right, 2 up) to (2 right, 2 up) next to the ball. 
2. Create the rule ""ball is win."" 
3. Move to the ball, which would now be the win object. 

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to navigate to its position. If I'm currently at a position where I can move right, that might be the way. Assuming I'm adjacent to the ""is"" rule, I can push it right. But based on the observations, after previous actions, the positions might have shifted. 

In the latest observation, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from Baba. The ball is 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So the distance between the ""is"" and the ball is 1 step right. Therefore, I can move right once to get next to the ""is"" rule, then push it right once more to place it next to the ball. Once that's done, I can create the ""ball is win"" rule. 

Then, moving right once more to the ball would make me win. 

So the actions needed are: right (to reach the ""is""), right again (to move the ""is"" next to the ball), then right once more to the ball. But since each action is a single step, I need to sequence these correctly. 

But the user is asking for a single action to take now. Given the current observation, where am I positioned? The problem is that the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. However, based on the previous actions, maybe after moving left multiple times, the player is now adjacent to the ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move left to reach the ""is"" rule. Wait, in the last observation, after moving left, the ""is"" rule is now 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So the player must be to the left of that. Therefore, to get to the ""is"" rule, the player needs to move right once. 

So the immediate action should be to move right to reach the ""is"" rule, then proceed to move it. But since the user is asking for the next action, and given that the previous attempt resulted in failure, maybe the correct action now is to move right to grab the ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, if the player is already next to the ""is"" rule, then pushing it right would be the next step. But according to the observation, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up, which suggests the player is not adjacent yet. Therefore, the correct action is to move right.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which I think is usually a door or something similar. But the rules might be different here.

Looking at the active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you"". So as Baba, I can move around. The objects on the map include a ball, walls, and a ""win"" rule at position 9 steps right and 2 steps up. Wait, but ""win"" here is a rule, not an object. Maybe the actual win condition is defined by that rule. Typically, ""win"" might be an object that you touch, but since it's a rule, maybe I need to make myself ""win"" somehow.

The walls are everywhere, so I need to navigate around them. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which means anything (including me) touching that is stopped. The door is at 8 steps right and 1 step down, but I can't go through walls. 

The ball is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. Maybe moving towards it? But why? There's a rule ""ball is..."" somewhere else? Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down"". So that's the ""ball is [...]"" text block. But right now, the active rules only have ""baba is you"". 

To manipulate the rules, I need to move the text blocks. For example, if I can pick up the ""is"" rule and combine it with ""ball"" and ""win"" or something. But how do I move things? The problem is that I might be able to move objects that aren't defined as ""stop"" or similar. Let's check which objects are stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So anything on that spot is immovable. The walls are also probably stop because they're walls. So I can move anything that's not a wall or stop.

So, the ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable. If I can move them to create new rules, like ""ball is win"" or ""baba is win"", that might change the win condition. Let me see the positions:

- There's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can get to that and combine it with the ""ball"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, maybe I can make ""ball is win"". Then touching the ball would make me win. But how to get there?

Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can create ""baba is win"", then I would be the win object. But where is the ""is"" rule needed for that? There's another ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. Maybe moving that towards the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 4 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 4 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" from 4 steps down to be next to ""baba"" and ""you"", maybe I can make ""baba is you"" into ""baba is win"".

But first, I need to move Baba (me) to those positions. Let me check my current position. Wait, the user hasn't specified where Baba is located in the observation. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to plan. But maybe the initial position is implied. Typically, Baba starts at the bottom left or something. But in the given observations, the objects are listed, but not Baba's position. Wait, looking back at the observations, the user hasn't mentioned Baba's position explicitly. That's confusing. How am I supposed to know where to move?

Wait, in the problem statement, the user says ""Your goal is usually to reach an object defined as 'WIN', but this can be changed."" So I need to find the 'WIN' object. In the current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The objects include a rule `win` at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. But how do I get there? There are walls blocking the path. Let's see the map layout.

Assuming Baba is somewhere on the grid, but since the position isn't given, maybe I have to deduce it from the objects. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects me to assume a starting position. This is a bit of a flaw in the problem description. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to navigate. But maybe the key is to look for movable objects and rules.

The available actions are moving up, down, left, right, or idle. The goal is to create a rule that makes me the win condition. For example, if I can create ""baba is win"", then touching any 'win' object would make me win. Alternatively, making the 'win' object something I can move to.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right, 1 step up; 4 steps right; 4 steps right and 1 step down, etc. So the path to the right is blocked by walls starting at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to go around them. But how?

Alternatively, use the 'is' rules to create new rules. For example, if I can pick up the 'is' at 8 steps right and 2 steps up and move it to combine with 'baba' and 'win'. Let's see:

The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 4 steps down. If I move down to 4 steps down, pick up the 'is' there, then move left to the 'baba' rule, and combine them with 'win' which is somewhere else. But I need to know where 'win' is. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up, which is far to the right.

Alternatively, create ""ball is win"" so that touching the ball makes me win. The ball is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. There's a 'rule `is`' at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe move that 'is' down to the ball's position. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the 'is' rules to create new rules.
2. Combine 'baba' with 'win' using an 'is' rule to make ""baba is win"".
3. Then, moving next to the 'win' object (if any) would make me win.

But where is the 'win' object? The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. If that's the definition, then perhaps the actual win condition is to touch the position where the 'win' rule is, but that doesn't make sense. Usually, 'win' is an object like a door. Alternatively, the 'win' rule defines that touching a certain object makes you win. For example, if ""door is win"", then touching the door wins.

In the current setup, there's a 'door' rule at 8 steps right and 1 step down. So if I can make ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win'.

The 'door' rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step down. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. The 'is' rules are at 8 steps right and 2 steps up, and 4 steps down. This seems a bit scattered.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to get the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. The 'is' rule is at 4 steps down. So perhaps move down to 4 steps down, take the 'is' rule, then move left to the 'baba' rule, place the 'is' there, then move right to the 'win' rule and combine.

But the problem is navigation. Let's think about movement:

Current assumed position (since not given): Maybe I'm at the starting point, say bottom left. But without knowing, it's hard. Alternatively, look for the 'baba' object. Wait, in the observations, there's a ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down"". So the 'baba' rule is there, but where is the actual Baba? Probably adjacent to that rule. So if the 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down, then Baba is likely at that position or next to it.

Assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's position (1 step left, 4 steps down), then I can move around. The 'is' rule is at 4 steps down, which is directly below me (if I'm at 1 step left, 4 steps down, then moving right to 4 steps down would reach the 'is' rule). So maybe move right to get the 'is' rule.

Once I have the 'is' rule, I can move up to combine with 'baba' and 'win'. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. That's a distance. So perhaps move right, up, etc., but need to avoid walls.

Alternatively, create ""baba is you"" which is already the case, but that's not helping. Need to change the win condition.

Another approach: Make the ball the win condition. There's a ball at 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. The 'is' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. So maybe move that 'is' rule down to the ball's position.

To get there, from my current position (assuming at baba's rule at 1 left, 4 down), move right to 4 down (where 'is' is), take that 'is', then move left to the ball's position (1 right, 2 up). But there are walls in the way. Let's see:

From 4 steps down (the 'is' position), moving left to 1 step left, 4 down (baba's rule), but that's where I came from. To get to the ball at 1 right and 2 up, I need to move right, up, etc. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the other 'is' rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that 'is' rule down to combine with 'ball' and 'win'.

The 'ball' is at 1 right, 2 up. The 'is' is at 8 right, 2 up. So there's a distance between them. Maybe move the 'is' from 8 right, 2 up to 1 right, 2 up, but that would require moving left 7 steps, which is impossible due to walls at 4 steps right.

This seems really complicated. Maybe the solution is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the 'is' from 4 steps down to connect 'baba' and 'win'.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Move from current position (assuming at baba's rule at 1 left, 4 down) right to 4 steps down to get the 'is' rule.
2. Move left to the 'baba' rule at 1 left, 4 down.
3. Place the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to create ""baba is win"".
4. Then, move to the 'win' rule's position (9 right, 2 up) to trigger the win.

But how to move the 'is' rule to that position? The 'win' rule is far to the right, blocked by walls. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Another angle: The 'door' rule is at 8 right, 1 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then touching the door would win. To do that, get an 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win'.

The 'door' is at 8 right, 1 down. The 'win' is at 9 right, 2 up. The 'is' rules are at 8 right, 2 up and 4 down. Maybe move the 'is' from 8 right, 2 up down to 8 right, 1 down (door's position), then place 'is' there and combine with 'door' and 'win'.

But moving from 8 right, 2 up to 8 right, 1 down requires moving down one step, which is possible if there's no wall. Looking at the objects, at 8 right, 1 down, there's a 'rule `door`'. So the 'door' rule is there, and possibly a wall? The walls are at 4 steps right, various positions. So 8 right is beyond the walls mentioned (the walls are up to 5 steps right in some positions). So maybe moving down from 8 right, 2 up to 8 right, 1 down is possible.

Once at 8 right, 1 down, place the 'is' there next to 'door' and 'win' (which is at 9 right, 2 up). But that's not adjacent. Hmm.

This is quite tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'win' rule to be under Baba, making him the win condition. For example, move the 'win' rule to where Baba is, so ""baba is win"".

To do that, take the 'win' rule at 9 right, 2 up and move it left to Baba's position. But how? The 'win' rule is a text block, so if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. Looking at the objects, the 'win' rule's properties: Is it stop? The active rules are only ""baba is you"". There's a 'rule `stop`' at 3 right, 1 down, which makes that position a stop. The 'win' rule itself is just a text block; unless there's a rule like ""win is stop"", it's movable. Since there's no such rule, the 'win' rule can be moved.

So, the plan is:

1. Move to the 'win' rule at 9 right, 2 up.
2. Pick it up and move it left to where Baba is (assuming his position is near the 'baba' rule at 1 left, 4 down).
3. Place the 'win' rule next to the 'baba' rule and an 'is' rule to create ""baba is win"".

But navigating there is complicated. Let's see the path:

From current observation, the 'win' rule is at 9 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right 5 times (if starting at 4 right), but there's a wall at 4 right. So maybe go around the walls. Alternatively, use other rules to modify movement.

Alternatively, use the 'is' rules to create a path. For example, create ""wall is push"" or something, but that requires changing rules.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the simplest valid action is to move towards the 'is' rule at 8 right, 2 up to create a new rule. For example, move right to get closer to that 'is' rule.

But without knowing my exact position, it's hard to say. Given the previous actions failed due to invalid format, I need to choose an action from up, down, left, right, or idle.

Considering the last observation, after moving left, the ball is now at 2 right, 2 up. The 'is' rule is at 8 right, 2 up. Maybe moving right towards the 'is' rule to pick it up and combine with 'ball' and 'win'.

But again, without knowing where I am, it's a shot in the dark. The safest bet might be to move right to reach the 'is' rule at 8 right, 2 up.

Alternatively, move down to avoid walls. Looking at the current objects, moving down from my position might be possible if there's no wall.

Given the uncertainty, I'll go with moving right to towards the 'is' rule at 8 right, 2 up.

The goal is to get to the 'win' object. Looking at the active rules, ""baba is you"" means I can move Baba around. The 'win' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a rule 'win' there. But between me and the 'win' there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up. The wall is also defined by the 'wall is...' rule, which might make it a STOP object? STOP means I can't push through it.

So the path to the 'win' is blocked by the wall. Need to find a way around. The ball is at 2 steps up, maybe I can move it or use it somehow. Also, there's a 'rule is' block at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that 'is' rule to change another rule. 

The 'door' is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe I can go through it. But how? The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. If I can remove 'stop' from the door or change the door's property.

Wait, the 'rule is' is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that 'is' block to attach to the 'door' or 'stop' rules. For example, if I make 'door is you', then touching the door would make me the winner. Or change 'stop' to something else. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't STOP, maybe I can push the ball towards the 'win' location. The ball is at 2 steps up, and the 'win' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. The ball is 6 steps to the right of the current position. But how to move it? The ball is probably a movable object unless there's a 'stop' on it. The 'rule ball' is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, so maybe the ball's property is defined there. 

If I can move the 'rule is' block next to the 'ball' rule, maybe I can change 'ball' to 'win' or 'you'. For example, moving 'is' next to 'ball' and 'win' would create 'ball is win', making the ball the win condition. Then stepping on the ball would make me win. 

Looking at the current setup: the 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I move right towards the 'is' rule, then maybe grab it and move it to the 'ball' rule which is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. But the path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the 'is' to the 'door' to make 'door is you' or similar. 

Wait, the 'you' rule is at 4 steps down. If I can make 'baba is you' by moving the 'is' next to 'baba', but 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. Hmm. Maybe that's not the immediate issue. 

Another approach: The 'win' is a rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can change that rule to 'baba is win', then I would be the win condition. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'is' is currently at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I move right towards the 'win' location, maybe I can position the 'is' between 'baba' and 'win'. But the path has walls. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' from 1 step left and 2 steps up to be next to 'baba' which is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. That might require moving down and left, but there are walls in the way. 

Wait, the current position of the player (Baba) isn't explicitly listed, but the 'rule baba' is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. So I'm there. To get to the 'is' rule at 1 step left and 2 steps up, I need to move up and left. From my position (2 left, 4 down), moving left 1 step and up 2 steps would get me to the 'is' rule. But the path: up one step from 4 down to 3 down, then left to 1 left, 3 down. Then up another step to 2 up. Are there walls in between? 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 up, but that's on the other side. My current position is 2 left, 4 down. Moving left to 1 left, 4 down is a wall? No, the walls are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, etc. So moving left from 2 left to 1 left at 4 down is possible. Then up to 1 left, 3 down — is there a wall there? The walls listed are at 4 steps right and various positions, so probably not. Then up to 1 left, 2 up — that's the 'is' rule. So I can move up and left to get the 'is' rule.

Once I have the 'is' rule, I need to move it to attach to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 4 down. Maybe it's easier to attach 'is' to 'baba' and 'you' to make 'baba is you', but that's already the case. Alternatively, attach 'is' to 'win' and something else. 

If I move the 'is' rule to the 'win' location (8 right, 2 up), then create 'baba is win' by placing 'is' between 'baba' and 'win'. But 'baba' is at 2 left, 4 down. That's quite far. Maybe a better approach is to make the 'door' the win condition. 

The 'door' is at 7 right, 1 down. If I can make 'door is win', then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win'. The 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. So moving the 'is' from 1 left, 2 up to 7 right, 1 down would require a lot of steps. Not sure if feasible. 

Alternatively, use the 'ball' to reach the 'win' location. If I can change the ball's property to 'win', then stepping on it would work. The 'ball' rule is at 7 right, 2 down. If I move the 'is' there and make 'ball is win', then the ball becomes the win object. 

So steps: 

1. Move from current position (2 left, 4 down) to the 'is' rule at (1 left, 2 up). That's moving left 1, up 2. 

2. Once have the 'is' rule, move it to the 'ball' rule at (7 right, 2 down). But the path from (1 left, 2 up) to (7 right, 2 down) is long. There are walls at 3 right, 1 down and others, but maybe possible by moving right and down avoiding walls. 

3. Place the 'is' next to 'ball' and 'win' to create 'ball is win'. Then go to the ball and win.

Alternatively, after getting the 'is', move it to the 'win' rule at (8 right, 2 up) and attach to 'baba' to make 'baba is win'. But 'baba' is far away. 

Another idea: The 'you' rule is at 4 steps down. If I can make 'baba is you' again, but it's already active. Maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, make 'stop' not a stop. If I can change the 'stop' rule's property. The 'stop' is at 2 right, 1 down. If I move the 'is' there and make 'stop is ...', but not sure. 

Hmm. Let's focus on the ball approach. If I can make the ball the win condition. So:

- Grab the 'is' rule at (1 left, 2 up).

- Move right towards the 'ball' rule at (7 right, 2 down). Path: from (1 left, 2 up) move right 8 steps to reach 7 right, but there are walls at 3 right and various positions. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in several positions. So moving right from 1 left to 7 right would pass through 2,3,4,5,6,7. But at 3 right, there's a wall at 3 right, 1 down and others. But when moving up and right, maybe possible. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to the 'ball' and 'win' positions. The 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. The ball is at 7 right, 2 down. So placing 'is' between 'ball' and 'win' would make 'ball is win'. 

So the plan is:

1. Move up and left to get the 'is' rule.

2. Carry the 'is' rule to the 'ball' location (7 right, 2 down).

3. Place the 'is' next to 'ball' and 'win' to create 'ball is win'.

4. Then move to the ball and win.

But how to move the 'is' rule there? The movement requires navigating around walls. From (1 left, 2 up), moving right towards 7 right, 2 down. Let's see:

Current position after getting 'is': (1 left, 2 up).

Move right 2 steps to (2 right, 2 up) – no wall there.

Move down to (2 right, 1 up).

Move right 3 steps to (5 right, 1 up) – but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So can't go past that. Hmm, that's a problem. 

Alternative path: From (1 left, 2 up), move down to (1 left, 1 up). Then right to (2 left, 1 up), then down to (2 left, 4 down) which is my original position. Not helpful. 

Maybe another route. From (1 left, 2 up), move right to (2 left, 2 up), then right again to (3 left, 2 up). But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 up. So can't go there. 

This is tricky. Maybe the ball approach isn't feasible. Let's think differently. 

What if I make the 'door' the win condition? The door is at 7 right, 1 down. If I can make 'door is win', then touching it would win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win'. The 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. So the 'is' would need to be between 'door' and 'win'. 

From my current position (2 left, 4 down), moving to the 'is' at (1 left, 2 up), then moving right and down towards the door. 

Path: (1 left, 2 up) → right to (2 left, 2 up) → right to (3 left, 2 up) – wall there. Can't. 

Alternative: From (1 left, 2 up), move down to (1 left, 1 up) → right to (2 left, 1 up) → down to (2 left, 4 down) – back to start. Not helpful. 

Hmm. Maybe the key is to push the ball over the 'win' rule. The ball is at 2 steps up. The 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. So the ball is 6 steps to the right of the 'win'. If I can move the ball to the 'win' location, then since 'win' is a rule, maybe that works. But how to move the ball. The ball is a movable object unless there's a 'stop' on it. The 'stop' rule is at 2 right, 1 down. So unless the ball is 'stop', I can push it. 

The ball's rule is at 7 right, 2 down, which says 'rule ball'. So the ball's property is defined there. If I can change the ball's property to 'push' or remove the 'stop', but I don't see a 'stop' on the ball. 

So maybe I can push the ball towards the 'win' location. The path from the ball's current position (2 steps up) to the 'win' (8 right, 2 up) is horizontally. The ball is at 2 steps up, so same vertical level as the 'win'. The ball is at 2 steps up, but the 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. So the ball is to the left of the 'win'. To push the ball right, I need to be next to it and move right. 

But the ball is at 2 steps up. Where am I currently? At 2 left, 4 down. To get to the ball's position at 2 steps up, I need to move up 6 steps. Let's see:

From (2 left, 4 down):

Up 1 → (2 left, 3 down)

Up 1 → (2 left, 2 down)

Up 1 → (2 left, 1 down)

Up 1 → (2 left, 0 down) – assuming down 0 is the starting point.

Up 1 → (2 left, 1 up)

Up 1 → (2 left, 2 up) – where the ball is.

So moving up to reach the ball. Once there, can I push it right? The ball is at 2 left, 2 up. To push right, I need to move right myself and the ball would move into my previous position. But the space to the right of the ball (3 left, 2 up) – is that free? Checking the objects: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 up, but that's far to the right. So from 2 left, 2 up, moving right to 3 left, 2 up – is that a wall? The walls listed are at 4 steps right and 2 up, so no. So yes, I can push the ball right. 

But to push the ball, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction. So if I move right from the ball's position, the ball would move left. Wait, no: when you push an object, you move into its space, and it moves into your previous space. So if I'm at 2 left, 2 up (next to the ball), and I move right to 3 left, 2 up, the ball would move left to 2 left, 2 up. But that doesn't help. 

Wait, the ball is at 2 left, 2 up. To push it right, I need to be to the left of the ball and move right. So I move from 1 left, 2 up to 2 left, 2 up (where the ball is), then move right to 3 left, 2 up. The ball would then move from 2 left, 2 up to 1 left, 2 up. That doesn't help. 

Alternatively, I need to be to the right of the ball and move left to push it right. But the ball is at 2 left, 2 up. If I'm at 3 left, 2 up, and move left into the ball's space, it would push the ball to 4 left, 2 up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 up, which is 6 left from my current position. So that's not possible. 

This approach might not work. Let's go back. 

The 'is' rule is at 1 left, 2 up. If I can get that and move it to the 'win' rule at 8 right, 2 up, then create 'baba is win'. But the distance is huge. Alternatively, create 'you is win' so that touching the win object makes me win. 

The 'you' rule is at 4 steps down. If I can make 'you is win', then stepping on the win object would work. To do that, move the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'win'. 

From my current position (2 left, 4 down), move to the 'is' at (1 left, 2 up), then move down to (1 left, 4 down) – which is the 'is' rule at 4 steps down? No, the 'is' rule at 4 steps down is separate. Wait, the 'is' rule at 1 step left and 4 steps down is part of the lower rules. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to create 'baba is win' by moving the 'is' rule next to both 'baba' and 'win'. 

The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 4 down. The 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. The 'is' rule is at 1 left, 2 up. So I need to move the 'is' rule from (1 left, 2 up) to be between 'baba' and 'win'. 

But the distance is too great. Maybe there's a shortcut. 

Wait, the 'rule is' at 8 steps right and 2 steps up is another 'is' block. Maybe I can use that instead. 

Looking at the objects: there's a 'rule is' at 8 right, 2 up and another at 1 left, 2 up. 

If I use the 'is' at 8 right, 2 up, which is next to the 'win' rule. Then create 'win is win' which doesn't help. Not useful. 

Alternatively, use the 'is' at 1 left, 2 up. Move it to the 'baba' rule at 2 left, 4 down. But that requires moving down 2 steps and right 1 step. 

From (1 left, 2 up) → move down to (1 left, 1 up) → down to (1 left, 0 up) → down to (1 left, -1 up) – assuming down is negative. But the map layout might be different. 

Alternatively, from (1 left, 2 up), move left to 0 left","

The current observation shows that the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can interact with objects by moving them or repositioning rules. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But there's also a ""door"" at 7 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm, doors might require a key or something. Then there's a ball at 2 steps up, which might be relevant if I can make it do something.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered around. The ones that stand out are the ones at 7 steps right and 2 steps up (another ""is"") and the one at 1 step left and 4 steps down. Also, there's a ""you"" rule at 4 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I need to create a new rule that makes Baba a WIN or something else.

The walls are pretty much blocking direct paths to the WIN. The STOP rule at 2 steps right and 1 step down is probably making that area immovable. So, how can I manipulate the rules to bypass these?

If I can move the ""win"" rule closer or create a new rule that makes reaching it possible. For example, if I take the ""win"" text block that's at 8 steps right and 2 steps up and move it somewhere else, or combine it with another rule. But wait, can I move the ""win"" rule? The rules say I can only move objects not defined as STOP or similar. The ""win"" rule itself isn't marked as STOP, so maybe I can pick it up and reposition it.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a WIN by creating a new rule. Since ""baba is you"" is active, if I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching the WIN block would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Looking at the positions:

- The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down.
- There's an ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 4 steps down, right next to ""baba.""
- The ""you"" rule is at 4 steps down, 1 step right from the ""is.""

So if I can move the ""win"" rule (at 8 right, 2 up) down to near the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, I could form ""baba is win."" But the path might be blocked by walls or STOP rules. Let's check the path from the current ""win"" position to the ""baba"" area.

The ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. To get to the ""baba"" area (2 left, 4 down), I need to move down and left. However, there are walls at 3 steps right in various positions, and a STOP at 2 right, 1 down. So maybe moving down from the ""win"" position is possible if I can navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing ""is"" rule at 1 left, 4 down. If I can bring the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and that ""is,"" then combine them. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule down and left. Let's see:

The ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. Moving down two steps would bring it to 8 right, 0 up (assuming up is negative down). But the map might have a grid where up and down are relative. Wait, the observations list positions relative to the player's current location. So ""2 step up"" means two steps upward from where I am. Maybe I need to track my own position relative to these objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to move the ""win"" rule closer to the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules. Let's see the positions again:

- ""baba"" rule: 2 left, 4 down
- ""is"" rule: 1 left, 4 down (adjacent to ""baba"")
- ""you"" rule: 4 down (1 right of the ""is"")
- ""win"" rule: 8 right, 2 up

So the ""win"" is quite far away. To move it, I need to navigate to its location, which is 8 steps to the right and 2 up from my current position. But there are walls at 3 steps right in various directions. Also, a STOP at 2 right, 1 down. So moving right might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 1 left, 4 down to a position between ""baba"" and the ""win"" rule. But again, pathing might be an issue.

Wait, another approach: if I can make the ball a WIN by creating ""ball is win."" The ball is at 2 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position, then touching the ball would make it a WIN. But the ball is at 2 up, and the ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. So the ball is directly below the ""win"" rule? Or are their positions offset?

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball's location, then the ball would become WIN. Then, since I'm Baba (YOU), pushing the ball to the WIN area (the original WIN position at 8 right, 2 up) might work. But I need to see if the ball can be moved. The ball isn't marked as STOP, so I can probably push it.

But first, how to get to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. From my current position, moving right 8 steps and up 2 would get there, but there's a wall at 3 steps right, which blocks that path. So maybe I need to find another route.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create a new rule. For example, if I can take the ""is"" at 7 right, 2 up and move it near the ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" But the ball is at 2 up, and the ""is"" is at 7 right, 2 up. So moving the ""is"" left to the ball's position.

But moving left from 7 right, 2 up to 2 up (ball's position) would require moving left 5 steps. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right, which might be in the way. Also, the path might be blocked by other walls.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap:

- I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"" means I can move objects and rules unless they're STOP.
- The goal is likely to reach the WIN rule, but it's blocked by walls.
- Possible solutions: move the WIN rule closer, create a new rule that makes Baba WIN, or manipulate other objects.

Another angle: the ""door"" at 7 right, 1 down. If I can make a KEY and associate it with the door, but there's no key mentioned. Alternatively, if I can make the door passable by changing its rule. But the door's rule is ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 1 step down,"" which I can't modify unless I move it.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that ""Baba is YOU"" and ""Baba is WIN"" would make touching the WIN block win the game. So, if I can create the rule ""baba is win,"" that would do it. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left, 4 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down (adjacent). The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 left, 4 down to a position between ""baba"" and ""win."" But how?

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" area. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. To get it to the ""baba"" area (2 left, 4 down), I need to move left 10 steps and down 6 steps. That's a long way, and there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at 7 right, 2 up. If I can move that ""is"" to near the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules. The ""is"" at 7 right, 2 up: moving left to 2 up (ball's position) would require left 5 steps. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, which might block that path.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: push the ball towards the WIN area. If I can make the ball into a WIN by creating ""ball is win,"" then pushing the ball to the original WIN location (8 right, 2 up) would make it a WIN, and since I'm YOU, touching it would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the ball's current position (2 up) or move the ball to the ""win"" rule's position.

The ball is at 2 up. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. So the ball is directly below the ""win"" rule? Or are they in the same row? If they're in the same vertical line, moving the ""win"" down to the ball's position would make ""ball is win"" if the rules are adjacent.

But the ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up, and the ball is at 2 up. So horizontally, they're separated by 6 steps to the right. To move the ""win"" left 6 steps to align with the ball, but there's a wall at 3 steps right, which is in the way. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, move the ball to the ""win"" position. The ball is at 2 up. To get it to 8 right, 2 up, I need to move it right 6 steps. But the path to the right is blocked by walls starting at 3 steps right. So can't move the ball that way.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to look for a different rule combination. The ""you"" rule is at 4 steps down. If I can make ""you"" into ""win,"" but that might not help since I'm already YOU. Wait, ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""you is win,"" then since I'm YOU, that would make me WIN. But how to create ""you is win.""

The ""you"" rule is at 4 steps down. There's an ""is"" rule at 1 left, 4 steps down next to the ""baba"" rule. So if I can move the ""win"" rule to the right of the ""you"" rule, forming ""you is win."" The ""win"" is currently at 8 right, 2 up. To move it to 4 steps down, that's a big move. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win.""

But again, movement is restricted by walls and STOPs.

Another idea: since the ball is at 2 up, and there's a ""win"" at 8 right, 2 up, maybe pushing the ball to the ""win"" location by creating a rule like ""ball is push"" or something. But I don't have a ""push"" rule. Wait, the default rules might allow pushing if you're a YOU. Since I'm YOU, maybe I can push objects. But the ball isn't STOP, so I can push it. If I push the ball towards the ""win"" rule, maybe that triggers something. But the ""win"" is a rule, not a physical object. Unless the ball being in the same space as the ""win"" rule makes it a WIN.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position, then the ball becomes WIN. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule left 6 steps from 8 right to 2 up (ball's x-coordinate). But there's a wall at 3 steps right, which is in the way. So moving left from 8 right would hit the wall at 3 right, blocking the path.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to focus on moving the ""is"" rules to create the desired rule. For example, take the ""is"" at 7 right, 2 up and move it to the left next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But how?

The ""is"" at 7 right, 2 up: to get to the ""baba"" area (2 left, 4 down), it's a long way. Alternatively, move the ""is"" at 1 left, 4 down (next to ""baba"") to combine with ""win."" But ""win"" is far away.

Wait, maybe the key is to use the existing ""is"" at 1 left, 4 down. If I can bring the ""win"" rule to the right of it, forming ""baba is win."" The ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. To move it down to 4 down, that's a big move. Alternatively, move the ""is"" up to the ""win"" location. But the ""is"" at 1 left, 4 down would need to move up 2 steps and right 7 steps to reach the ""win"" at 8 right, 2 up. That's possible if the path is clear.

Checking the path from 1 left, 4 down to 8 right, 2 up:

- Moving up from 4 down to 2 up (2 steps up).
- Moving right from 1 left to 8 right (9 steps right).

But along the way, there are walls at 3 steps right in various positions. For example, at 3 steps right, 1 step up there's a wall. So moving right past that would be blocked.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Since I'm Baba and can move rules, perhaps I can create a rule that makes the door passable or removes the STOP property.

The door is at 7 right, 1 down. If I can make the door a STOP or remove its STOP property, but I don't see a corresponding rule. Alternatively, if I can make the door into a YOU or WIN.

Alternatively, use the ball to interact with the door. If the ball is a KEY, then putting it in the door might open it. But there's no KEY rule.

Alternatively, make the ball a WIN by moving the ""win"" rule to the ball's location. But as before, movement is blocked.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The ball is at 2 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule down to the ball's y-coordinate (2 up) and align it horizontally. The ball is at 2 up, so moving the ""win"" down 0 steps (same y). Horizontally, the ball is at its current x, and the ""win"" is at 8 right. So to align them, move the ""win"" left to the ball's x. But the ball's x isn't specified in the observation. Hmm, the observation lists objects with relative positions. For example, ""ball 2 step up"" means the ball is two steps up from the player's current position. Similarly, ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up"" is nine steps right and two up from the player.

So the player's position is the reference point. Let's assume the player is at (0,0). Then:

- Ball is at (0, 2) (two steps up).
- Win rule is at (9, 2) (nine right, two up).
- The ""is"" rule near the ball is at (-1, 2) (one left, two up).
- The ""baba"" rule is at (-2, -4) (two left, four down).
- The ""is"" at 1 left, 4 down is at (-1, -4).
- The ""you"" rule is at (0, -4).

So to create ""baba is win,"" I need to place ""baba"" ""is"" ""win"" in adjacent tiles. The ""baba"" is at (-2, -4), the ""is"" is at (-1, -4), and the ""win"" is at (9, 2). They're not adjacent. The ""win"" is way to the right and up.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to near the ""baba"" area. The ""win"" is at (9,2). To get to (-2, -4), it's a move of left 11 and down 6. Impossible due to walls.

Another idea: use the existing ""is"" at (-1, 2) (one left, two up) which is near the ball. If I can move the ""win"" rule down to (9, 0) and left to (-1, 0), then combine with ""baba."" But again, pathing is blocked.

Maybe the solution is to push the ball towards the ""win"" rule. Since I'm YOU, I can push the ball. The ball is at (0,2). The ""win"" is at (9,2). If I push the ball right, but there's a wall at (3,1), so moving right from (0,2) would hit the wall at (3,1) if the path is blocked. Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down is at (3, -1) relative to the player. So the ball is at (0,2), and pushing right would go towards increasing x. The walls at (3, -1) are not in the same row as the ball.

Wait, maybe the path from the ball to the ""win"" is clear. The ball is at (0,2). To reach (9,2), need to move right 9 steps. But there's a wall at (3, -1), which is three steps right and one step down, so not on the same horizontal line. So moving right from (0,2) to (9,2) should be possible until hitting a wall. But according to the observation, walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down"" is at (3, -1). So the horizontal path at y=2 (same as the ball and win) is clear except for possible other walls.

If I can push the ball all the way to the ""win"" at (9,2), then the ball would be","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and manipulate other objects since I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, which is a door in some levels, but here the win rule is a text block that says 'win' next to a door. But I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'win' rule at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. There's also a 'door' at the same position as the 'win' rule. So normally, touching the door would make me win, but I need to confirm the current rules. The active rule is still 'baba is you,' so I can push or move objects unless they're stopped by 'stop' or similar.

On the map, there's a 'stop' rule at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Walls are also there, which are probably immovable. The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. The 'baba' text block is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down, along with 'is' and 'you' rules. Wait, 'you' is at 4 steps down, so does that mean I need to change the 'you' rule? No, because 'baba is you' is already active. So I am Baba, and I can move.

The problem is getting to the 'win' which is the door at 8 right, 2 up. But the path might be blocked. Let me visualize the map. From my current position (assuming I'm Baba at 2 left, 4 down based on the 'baba' rule's location?), maybe I need to move up. There's a wall at 3 right, 2 up, and another at 4 right, 2 up. The 'is' rule is at 1 left, 2 up, and 'win' is at 8 right, 2 up. So the direct path up is blocked by walls. There's a ball at 7 right, 2 down, which might be movable if I can get past the stop rule.

Wait, the 'stop' is at 2 right, 1 down. So if I'm at Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), moving down would take me to 2 left, 5 down, which is a wall. Maybe I need to move left or right. Let's see: the 'you' rule is at 4 down, 1 left. So if I move left from Baba's position (2 left,4 down) to 1 left,4 down, that's where the 'is' and 'you' rules are. But can I move through those? Since 'baba is you' and the 'is' and 'you' rules are text blocks, I can pick them up if they're not stopped. Wait, the 'stop' is at 2 right, 1 down, which is a different location. So maybe I can move left past the 'is' and 'you' rules.

But the main issue is reaching the 'win' door. The path up is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the ball or some other object to create a path. The ball is at 7 right, 2 down. If I can push it towards the stop rule or somewhere else. But the 'stop' is at 2 right, 1 down, which is a wall. Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make 'ball is win,' then touching the ball would make me win. Or change 'baba is win' so that I become the win condition.

Looking at the available text blocks: 'is' rules are at various positions. For example, there's an 'is' at 1 left, 2 up (near the wall), and another at 8 right, 2 up (near the win rule). The 'win' rule is separate. So if I can move the 'win' rule next to me, then touching it would work. Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to connect 'baba' with 'win'.

Wait, the current active rule is 'baba is you'. If I can create a new rule like 'baba is win', then I would be win. But to do that, I need to move the 'win' text block and the 'is' text block next to 'baba'. Let's see where the 'baba' rule is. The 'baba' text block is at 2 left, 4 down, with an 'is' at 1 left, 4 down and 'you' at 4 down. So if I can move the 'is' from 1 left,4 down to be next to 'baba' (2 left,4 down), and then place the 'win' rule (which is at 8 right,2 up) somewhere adjacent to me.

But moving those text blocks requires them not to be stopped. The 'stop' rule is at 2 right,1 down. So objects or text blocks there can't be moved. The 'is' rules and 'win' are likely movable unless they're under a 'stop' wall. Looking at the map, the 'win' is at 8 right,2 up, which is next to a wall, but the wall is 4 right,2 up. So the 'win' is not behind a stop; it's next to a wall but not blocked. So maybe I can move the 'win' rule.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the ball into the door. If the ball is at 7 right,2 down, and the door is at 7 right,1 down (since the door is at 7 steps right and 1 step down), then if I can push the ball up one step, it would be at 7 right,1 down, which is the door. Then, if the ball is the win condition, touching it would make me win. But how to make the ball the win condition? There's a 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up. Maybe move that 'win' rule to the ball's location.

So steps could be: move to the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up, then move it down to 7 right,1 down (the door's location). Then, move the 'is' rule from 1 left,2 up to connect 'ball' with 'win'. Then, the ball would be win, and if I can push it into the door, touching it would win.

But how to move the 'win' rule? I need to navigate to it. From my current position (Baba at 2 left,4 down), moving right would take me towards the walls. Let's see:

Current position: Assuming Baba is at the position of the 'baba' text block, which is 2 left,4 down. To reach the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up, I need to move right 10 steps and up 2 steps. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 3 right,2 up there's a wall. So maybe that's not feasible.

Alternative approach: Use the ball to break through walls. If the ball can be pushed into a 'stop' wall, but that might not help. Alternatively, rearrange the rules to change what 'win' is. If I can make 'ball is win', then pushing the ball into any location would make it win. So how?

To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule next to 'ball' and the 'is' rule next to both. For example:

1. Move to the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up.
2. Move down to 8 right,3 down (but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down? Not sure. The map shows walls at 4 steps right and various downs. Maybe this path is blocked.)
3. Alternatively, move the 'is' rule from 1 left,4 down to be next to 'baba' (2 left,4 down) and then place 'win' next to 'baba' to make 'baba is win'. Then I would be win.

But where is the 'is' rule? There's an 'is' at 1 left,4 down (same row as 'baba' and 'you'). If I move right from 'baba' (2 left,4 down) to 1 left,4 down, which is the 'is' rule. Then, if I can move that 'is' rule next to 'baba', making 'baba is ...', then add the 'win' rule.

So steps:

- Move left to pick up the 'is' rule at 1 left,4 down.
- Move right to place it next to 'baba' (2 left,4 down), making 'baba is'.
- Then move to the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up, bring it down to 2 left,4 down next to 'baba', creating 'baba is win'.
- Now, since I'm Baba and 'baba is win', touching anything would make me win. But the door is still a separate 'win' rule. Alternatively, maybe just being 'win' is enough.

But how to move the 'is' and 'win' rules? Need to navigate there. From Baba's position (2 left,4 down), moving right to 1 left,4 down (where 'is' is), then take that 'is' and move it to 2 left,4 down (next to 'baba'). Then move to 'win' at 8 right,2 up, take that and move it down to 2 left,4 down next to 'baba and is', making 'baba is win'.

Once that's done, I'm effectively the win condition, so any movement might count as winning. But the problem is getting to those positions without being blocked by walls or stops.

Alternatively, maybe the intended solution is to push the ball into the door. The ball is at 7 right,2 down. The door is at 7 right,1 down. So if I can push the ball up one step, it would be on the door. To push the ball, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the same direction. The ball is at 7 right,2 down. So from my current position (2 left,4 down), moving right 5 steps and down 2 steps to get next to the ball. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 3 right,2 up there's a wall, but maybe not in the lower area.

Alternatively, find a path to the ball. Let's see:

Baba is at 2 left,4 down. To reach the ball at 7 right,2 down:

Right 5 steps: 2 left → 7 left? Wait, directions might be relative. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, think in terms of grid movement.

Assuming the map is a grid where each object has coordinates:

- The 'baba' rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. So if the player is at (0,0), then 'baba' is at (-1,4).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to manipulate the rules to make 'baba' the win condition. Since the active rule is 'baba is you', and the goal is usually to reach 'win', perhaps changing 'baba is win' would make touching anything win. So the steps are:

1. Move to the 'is' rule at 1 left,4 down (which is at position (-1,4)).
2. Pick it up and move it to be next to 'baba', so 'baba is'.
3. Then move to the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up (position (8,2)).
4. Bring it down to next to 'baba', making 'baba is win'.
5. Now, since I'm Baba and 'baba is win', I automatically win just by existing.

But how to navigate there without being blocked. The path from (0,0) to (8,2) is blocked by walls at (3,2), (4,2), etc. So maybe this isn't possible.

Alternative idea: Use the ball to reach the door. If I can push the ball into the door, which is at (7,1) assuming the door's position is 7 right and 1 down. The ball is at (7,2). So push it up once. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ball and move up. But where is the player positioned?

If the player is at Baba's original position (2 left,4 down), which would be (-2,4), then moving right to reach the ball's area would require passing through walls. For example, moving right from (-2,4) to (0,4), but there's a wall at (3,2) up, but not sure about lower areas. This is getting too vague without a visual map.

Maybe the simplest solution is to move to the 'win' rule and 'is' rule, rearrange them to make 'baba is win', thus making myself the win condition. Even if the path is blocked, perhaps by pushing walls aside with the ball or other objects.

Alternatively, since there's a 'door' at 7 right,1 down, which is the same x as the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up. Maybe combining the 'door' and 'win' rules. But the 'win' rule is separate.

Another angle: The 'stop' rule is at 2 right,1 down. If I can push a wall or other object into the stop, maybe to disable it. But not sure.

Wait, the 'ball' is at 7 right,2 down. The 'door' is at 7 right,1 down. So if I can move the ball up into the door's position, then if the ball is the win condition, touching it would win. To make the ball the win condition, I need to create 'ball is win' rule.

So steps:

1. Move to the 'win' rule at 8 right,2 up.
2. Move left to 7 right,2 up (next to the ball's current position at 7 right,2 down? Not sure about the exact coordinates).
3. Place the 'win' rule next to the 'ball' rule, which is at 7 right,2 down. But how to get there?

This is quite complex without knowing the exact grid layout. But given the previous failed actions, maybe the assistant needs to try moving in a specific direction. Since previous attempts resulted in defaults to idle, perhaps the correct action is to move right to reach the 'is' rule and then rearrange.

Alternatively, the solution could be to move left to the 'is' rule at 1 left,4 down, pick it up, move right to place it next to 'baba', then get the 'win' rule and place it next to 'baba' to make 'baba is win'.

Given the previous observations, the last valid action before failure was 'left', which might have positioned the assistant near the 'is' rule. So the next step could be to move right to pick up the 'is' rule, then move further to place it and the 'win' rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate objects or move around since I'm Baba.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" object at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But there's also a ""stop"" wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So moving directly right might hit a stop wall. Wait, the ""win"" is protected by a ""stop"" wall? Maybe I need to find a way to remove the ""stop"" property from that wall or find another path.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 step up."" That might be a text block that says ""is"" located there. Also, there's a ""ball"" at 1 step left and 2 step up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change another rule.

The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object. But since ""win"" is defined as itself, maybe I need to change the rule that defines ""win."" For example, if I can make ""baba"" be ""win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. Or maybe change the ""win"" rule to something else.

Wait, there's a rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up. If I can move that text block, maybe I can place it next to something else. But how? The current rules only let me move objects that aren't ""STOP"" or similar. The ""is"" rule is movable, as well as the ball. The walls are defined as STOP, so I can't move them.

So maybe I can take the ""is"" rule and combine it with other objects. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" making Baba the Win object. Then touching the Win object would make me win.

Looking at the map, the ""is"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. The ball is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. The Baba with the ""you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 4 steps down. 

If I move the ""is"" rule from its current position (2 left, 2 up) to be next to the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules, maybe I can form ""baba is win."" Let's see: the current ""baba"" has a ""you"" rule at 1 step left and 4 steps down. Wait, no, the ""baba"" object itself is at 3 steps left and 4 steps down with the ""is"" and ""you"" rules. 

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" rule to where the ""win"" rule is. But the ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 2 up. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 2 up. So moving the ""is"" to the right would get it closer. Let's see: if I move right from the ""is"" position, each step right moves towards the ""win"" rule.

So the ""is"" rule is currently at 2 left, 2 up. If I move right multiple times, I can get it to the same vertical level as the ""win"" rule. Then, placing the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" would create the new rule. 

But how to position it? The ""baba"" with ""you"" is at 3 left, 4 down. That's lower down. The ""win"" rule is up at 7 right, 2 up. So maybe the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the walls. There's a wall at 3 right, 1 down. So moving right from the initial position might hit that wall.

Alternatively, maybe use the ball to move the ""is"" rule. Since the ball isn't STOP, I could push it. But the ball is at 1 left, 2 up. If I move the ball towards the ""is"" rule, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule with it. But I'm Baba, and I can move objects that aren't STOP. So if I move right towards the ""is"" rule, which is at 2 left, 2 up. Wait, the ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up from where? Maybe I need to calculate the positions relative to Baba's current location.

Wait, the observation doesn't specify Baba's current position. That's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to plan. But maybe the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left, 4 down. So maybe I'm located there? Or is that a separate object? The user hasn't specified Baba's position explicitly. This makes it tricky.

Assuming I'm at the ""baba"" object's position (3 left, 4 down), I need to move towards the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 2 up. Moving up from there would get me to the ""is"" rule. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see: from 3 left, 4 down, moving up one step would be 3 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 4 right, 5 right, etc., mostly on the right side. So moving up from Baba's position might be clear.

Once I reach the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 2 up, I can then move it to the right to combine with ""baba"" and ""win."" But how? The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 2 up. So moving the ""is"" rule all the way to the right would take several steps. Each move right would get closer. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 down. Wait, the walls are on the right side, so maybe moving right from the ""is"" rule's position is possible.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the left next to ""baba."" If I can place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then combining them would create ""baba is win."" But ""baba"" is at 3 left, 4 down, and the ""win"" rule is up at 7 right. This might not be adjacent.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the fastest way is to move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" location and then create a new rule. Alternatively, move the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" in some arrangement.

Another possibility: the ""door"" at 7 right, 1 down. If I can reach the door, maybe it's a way to pass through, but the door is likely locked unless there's a key, which I don't see here.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 1 left, 2 up. Maybe I can use the ball to push the ""is"" rule. Since the ball isn't STOP, I can move it. If I move the ball to the right, it might push the ""is"" rule. For example, if I move the ball right, it would move into the ""is"" rule's space, pushing it right. That could help in positioning the ""is"" where needed.

So the plan could be: move right towards the ball, push it to the right, which pushes the ""is"" rule further right. Repeating this might get the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Let me think step by step. Current position of ""is"" is 2 left, 2 up. The ball is at 1 left, 2 up. So the ball is one step to the right of the ""is"" rule. If I move right from the ball's position, I can push the ""is"" rule right. So first, move right to the ball's position, then push it right, which would move the ""is"" rule right.

But how do I get to the ball? If I'm at Baba's position (3 left, 4 down), moving up two steps would get me to 3 left, 2 down. Then right three steps to 6 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 4 right, 2 down. Wait, walls are at 5 steps to the right and various positions. This is getting too confusing without knowing exact coordinates.

Alternatively, focus on the available actions. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, idle. The latest observation shows that after moving right, the ""is"" rule is now at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. The ""win"" is at 7 right, 2 up. So maybe moving right multiple times to get the ""is"" rule closer to the ""win.""

But each move right would require checking if there's a wall in the way. The walls are mostly on the right side, so moving right from the current ""is"" position (2 left, 2 up) might be possible. If I move right, I can position the ""is"" next to the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""baba"" the ""win."" For that, I need to have ""baba"" adjacent to ""win"" and an ""is"" rule in between. So if I can move the ""is"" rule to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then touching the win object would work.

But ""baba"" is at 3 left, 4 down, and ""win"" is up at 7 right, 2 up. They're not adjacent. So maybe this isn't the way.

Another angle: the ""door"" at 7 right, 1 down. If I can make the door passable, maybe by removing the ""stop"" property. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 1 down. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, the door might no longer be stopped. But how?

Alternatively, change the ""door""'s property. If I can make ""door"" be ""you"" or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move any object that's not STOP. The ""stop"" wall is a property, not an object. The objects are wall, ball, door, etc. So maybe move the ""stop"" rule (the text block) to somewhere else. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the wall, then that wall becomes movable.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. If I can move that text block away, the wall at 4 right, 1 down (which is STOP) would no longer be defined as STOP, making it movable. Then I could push past it.

So the plan could be: move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, thus removing the STOP property from the wall. Once that's done, navigate around the wall to reach the ""win"" object.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. If I can get there, I can push it. But where am I located? If I'm at the ""baba"" position (3 left, 4 down), moving down to 3 left, 5 down, but there's a wall at 4 right, 5 down. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move up from Baba's position to reach the ""stop"" rule. From 3 left, 4 down, moving up two steps gets to 3 left, 2 down. Then right three steps to 6 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 5 right, 2 down. So that path is blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to focus on moving the ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's say I move the ""is"" rule to the right, next to the ""win"" rule. Then create ""win is you"" or something. Wait, but the goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object. If I can make ""baba"" be ""win,"" then touching the win object would make me win.

To do that, I need ""baba"" adjacent to ""win"" and an ""is"" rule in between. The ""baba"" is at 3 left, 4 down. The ""win"" is at 7 right, 2 up. They're not adjacent. So maybe this isn't feasible.

Another idea: use the ball to push objects. The ball is at 1 left, 2 up. If I move the ball to the right, it might push the ""is"" rule further right. For example, if I'm at the ball's position (1 left, 2 up) and move right, the ball would move into the ""is"" rule's space, pushing it right. Repeating this could position the ""is"" rule where needed.

So step by step: move right to the ball's position, then keep moving right to push the ""is"" rule. Each time I move right, the ball moves right, pushing the ""is"" rule right. After a few moves, the ""is"" rule could be next to the ""win"" rule.

Assuming I can do that, then creating the ""baba is win"" rule would allow me to touch the win object. But how to get the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win""? Since they're not in the same area, maybe this isn't possible.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""win"" be ""you,"" so touching the win object makes me win. To do that, I need to have ""win"" adjacent to ""you"" and an ""is"" rule in between. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. The ""win"" is up at 7 right, 2 up. Not adjacent.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be where I am, but I can't move the ""win"" rule because it's defined as an object. Only text blocks (rules) can be moved.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is a text block that says ""win."" If I can move that text block next to me (Baba), then the rule would change to ""baba is win,"" making me win. So the plan is: move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to Baba.

The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 2 up. Baba is at 3 left, 4 down. These positions are far apart. There's a lot of walls in between. How to navigate there?

Alternatively, use the ball to push the ""win"" rule. But the ball is small and might not be powerful enough. The ""win"" rule is a text block, and the ball is an object. If I push the ball into the ""win"" rule, maybe it can move it? But I'm not sure if you can push text blocks with objects.

In Baba Is You, you can push objects (like the ball) by moving into them from the side. If the ball is in a position where I can push it, and the ""win"" rule is next to the ball's path, maybe I can push the ball towards the ""win"" rule, thereby moving it.

For example, if the ball is at 1 left, 2 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 2 up, maybe I can push the ball all the way to the right, passing over the ""win"" rule and moving it. But there are walls blocking the path. The wall at 4 right, 2 up would stop the ball. So this might not work.

This is really frustrating. Let's recap:

- I'm Baba, with the ""you"" rule.
- Need to reach the ""win"" object.
- The ""win"" is protected by a ""stop"" wall.
- Possible solutions: remove the ""stop"" property, create a new rule making me ""win,"" or find a way around the wall.

The most promising seems to be removing the ""stop"" property from the wall. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule (text block) away. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. If I can move that text block, the wall at 4 right, 1 down (which is STOP) will no longer be STOP, making it movable.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule's position (3 right, 1 down).
2. Push it to a new location, say, one step left, changing its position.
3. Now, the wall at 4 right, 1 down is no longer STOP, so it can be moved past.

Once that's done, I can navigate around the wall to the ""win"" object.

But how to get to the ""stop"" rule's position? If I'm at Baba's position (3 left, 4 down), moving down to 3 left, 5 down, but there's a wall at 4 right, 5 down. So that's blocked. Moving up to 3 left, 2 down, then right to 6 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 5 right, 2 down. Blocked again.

Alternative path: From Baba's position (3 left, 4 down), move up to 3 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 4 right, various positions. So moving up to 3 left, 3 down might be possible. Then right to 4 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 4 right, 3 steps down (wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down). So can't move right past that.

This is really challenging. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about the rules again. The ""is"" rule is movable. If I can create a new rule that says ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. To do that, I need to have ""baba"" adjacent to ""win"" and an ""is"" rule in between.

But ""baba"" is at 3 left, 4 down, and ""win"" is at 7 right, 2 up. They're not adjacent. So maybe this isn't possible unless I move one of them, but I can't move the ""win"" rule directly.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is a text block. If I can move it next to Baba, then the rule would change. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, use the ball to push the ""win"" rule. But the ball is small and might not help.

Another idea: change the ""you"" rule to be ""win."" If I can make ""you"" equal to ""win,"" then since I'm ""you,"" I would be ""win."" To do that, create a rule ""you is win."" The ""you"" rule is currently at","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around freely unless there's a ""stop"" or similar property. Looking at the map, the ""win"" object is to the right at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. But there's a ""door"" at 6 steps right and 1 step down, and a ""ball"" at 6 steps right and 2 steps down. The walls and stop blocks are in the way.

First, I need to reach the ""win"" object. But the path is blocked by walls. The ""door"" might be a way through, but I don't know how to open it. Maybe I can change the rules. There are ""rule `is`"" blocks around. If I can move one of those to create a new rule, like ""door is win"" or something, that might let me pass through the door. 

Looking at the positions, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 2 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can place it next to the door to alter its property. Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 2 steps up could be useful. Since I'm controlled by ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not stopped. The ""rule `is`"" blocks aren't stopped, so I can move them.

If I move the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps left and 2 steps up to be next to the door, maybe I can make it say ""door is win."" That way, stepping on the door would make it a win condition. Alternatively, moving it to create ""baba is win"" or ""baba is door"" could work. 

Another approach: The ""ball"" is at 6 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can push the ball towards the door or the win condition, maybe that interacts somehow. But I'm not sure how the ball interacts with rules. 

Wait, the ""win"" is a separate object. So maybe I need to reach it directly. The path to the win is blocked by a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a ""rule `is`"" there. If I can move that rule to change the wall's property. For example, making ""wall is stop"" would just keep it as a stop. Not helpful. Maybe ""wall is nothing"" by moving a rule to negate it. But I don't see a ""nothing"" rule here.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the wall passable. Like ""wall is you"" but that would turn the wall into me, which might not help. Hmm.

Looking at the bottom part, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps left and 4 steps down, and ""you"" at 1 step left and 4 steps down. Maybe I can create a rule that makes ""baba"" something else. But I'm already ""baba is you,"" so moving the ""rule `is`"" there could change that. For example, if I move it to say ""baba is win,"" then I would be win, which might let me win immediately. 

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block from 2 steps left and 2 steps up to be next to ""baba"" at 3 steps left and 4 steps down. Wait, the current position of ""rule `is`"" is 2 steps left and 2 steps up. To get to where ""baba"" is, which is 3 steps left and 4 steps down, I need to move the rule block down and right. But how?

My current position isn't specified here. Wait, the observation doesn't say where I am. Oh right, in Baba Is You, you control Baba, so I need to look for the Baba object. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 3 steps left and 4 steps down. So I'm at that position. 

So I'm at 3 left, 4 down. The ""rule `is`"" I want to move is at 2 left, 2 up. To get to that rule, I need to move left and up. Let's see: from 3 left, 4 down, moving left once gets me to 2 left, 4 down. Then up once to 2 left, 3 down. Then up again to 2 left, 2 up. There's the rule block. Then I can pick it up and move it to where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 2 left, 4 down. So from 2 left, 2 up, move down twice to 2 left, 4 down, and place the ""is"" rule there. Then change it to ""baba is win"" by rearranging the text blocks. 

But the action here is just to choose a single movement action: up, down, left, right, or idle. So the immediate step is to move towards the ""rule `is`"" block at 2 left, 2 up. From my position at 3 left, 4 down, moving left once gets me to 2 left, 4 down. Then up once to 2 left, 3 down. Then up again to 2 left, 2 up. So the sequence would be left, up, up. But since I can only output one action at a time, I need to pick the next step. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. If I can move the ""rule `is`"" block that's at 6 steps right and 2 steps up, which is near the ""win"" object. Moving that rule next to ""win"" to make ""win is you"" or something. But I'm on the left side of the map. 

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to go to the ""rule `is`"" at 2 left, 2 up, grab it, and move it to the ""baba"" location at 3 left, 4 down. So the first move would be left to get to 2 left, 4 down. Then up to 2 left, 3 down. Then up to 2 left, 2 up. Then move the rule block down to 2 left, 4 down. Then place it there and rearrange the text to make ""baba is win"". 

But since each action is a single step, I need to choose the next movement. From my current position (3 left, 4 down), moving left once gets me to 2 left, 4 down. That's a valid move because there's no ""stop"" there. So the action should be left.

Let's see. The goal is to get to the WIN object, which is usually a flag or similar. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you"", meaning whatever I move, I can interact with based on the rules. I need to check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects: there's a ball at 2 steps up. There's a win rule at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Also, there's a stop rule at 2 steps right and 1 step down, which means anything touching that is stopped. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step down, but I don't know if it's openable yet. 

The player is Baba, and since ""baba is you"", I can move Baba around. The walls are immovable unless there's a rule that changes that. The ball is probably a key object. Maybe I need to move the ball to a certain spot? Or perhaps change the rules to make Baba into a Win object.

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you"". To win, maybe I need to make Baba ""win"". So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then I can create a new rule ""baba is win"". That would make Baba the win condition. 

Looking at the map, there's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 2 steps up. The ball is at 2 steps up. The win rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. So, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"", that would work. But how?

Baba is currently at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. Let me check the positions again. The rule `is` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. The ball is 2 steps up. The win is 8 steps right and 2 steps up. 

So, the plan is: move Baba to the ""is"" rule, then move the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win"". But to do that, I need to move Baba towards the ""is"" rule. From the current position (2 step left, 4 down), the ""is"" rule is 1 step left and 2 up. So, moving up twice and left once? Wait, but movement is step by step. Let's see:

Baba's position: rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. So, if I'm standing there, to get to the `is` rule at 1 left, 2 up, I need to move left once (to 1 left) and up twice. But need to check if there are walls blocking the path.

Looking at the walls: There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up, which is in the upper right. The path left and up from Baba's position: moving left from 2 left to 1 left is okay. Then up two steps. Is there any wall in between? The wall at 2 step left and 1 step up is a `wall` rule. So, if I move up once from Baba's position (4 down to 3 down), then another up to 2 down, but there's a wall at 2 step left and 1 step up? Wait, the wall is 2 step to the left and 1 step up relative to what? Maybe relative to Baba's position. Let me parse the map again.

The objects list includes ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". So that wall is two steps to the left and one step up from Baba's current position (which is 2 step left, 4 down). So, moving from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), moving left once would be 1 left, 4 down. Then up one step to 1 left, 3 down. Then up another step to 1 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 2 step left and 1 step up from Baba's original position, which would be 2 left + 2 left = 4 left, and 4 down + 1 up = 3 down. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions.

Alternatively, the wall's position is described as relative to some origin. Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. So, ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"" would be 2 steps left and 1 up from Baba's current location. So if Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity, that wall is at (-2, 1). But Baba is at 2 left and 4 down, which would be coordinates (-2, -4). Then the wall is at (-2 -2, -4 +1) = (-4, -3). Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are absolute. The `baba` rule is at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. So if the grid has Baba at position (0,0), then the `is` rule is at (-1, 2), the ball is at (0, 2), the wall is at (-2, 1), etc. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to focus on movement.

The key is to reach the `is` rule at 1 step left and 2 steps up. To get there from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), I need to move left once and up twice. But moving up twice would require passing through possible walls. The wall at 2 step left and 1 step up from Baba's position is in the way. So maybe I need to move around it.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to push the `is` rule. Since the rules can be moved if they're not stopped. The `is` rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. To move it next to `baba` and `win`, I need to first get next to the `is` rule. Then move it.

Wait, if I can move the `is` rule, then I can place it between `baba` and `win` to create the new rule. So the plan is: move Baba to the `is` rule, then move the `is` rule to be adjacent to both `baba` and `win`.

But how to move the `is` rule? Since `is` is a text block, and the player is Baba (you), and the rule is ""baba is you"", so you can move any text block that isn't stopped. Looking at the active rules, there's no ""stop"" on the `is` rule, so it can be moved.

So steps:

1. Move Baba to the `is` rule's location (1 left, 2 up).
2. Once next to the `is` rule, move it to be adjacent to `baba` (which is at 2 left, 4 down) and `win` (8 right, 2 up). 

But the `win` is far to the right. Maybe it's easier to first make Baba a Win by placing `is` next to `baba` and `win`.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the `is` rule between `baba` and `win`.

The `win` rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The `is` rule is at 1 left, 2 up. So the distance between them is quite large. Maybe there's a way to move the `is` rule towards the `win` by pushing it with Baba.

But first, get Baba close to the `is` rule. From current position (2 left, 4 down), move left once to 1 left, 4 down. Then up once to 1 left, 3 down. Then up again to 1 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 2 step left and 1 step up from Baba's original position, which would be at (-2 -2, -4 +1) = (-4, -3). Not sure if that affects the path.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are at specific positions. The wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up is probably blocking the upper right. But the path to the `is` rule is to the left and up, which might be clear.

Once Baba reaches the `is` rule at 1 left, 2 up, then he can pick up the `is` rule and move it. Then move it towards the `win` at 8 right, 2 up. But moving it 7 steps to the right would take time. Alternatively, move it to be next to `baba` first.

`baba` is at 2 left, 4 down. The `is` rule is at 1 left, 2 up. So moving the `is` rule down and right to get next to `baba`. For example, move the `is` rule down two steps to 1 left, 0 down (if possible), then right one step to 2 left, 0 down, placing it next to `baba` at 2 left, 4 down. Wait, but directions are relative.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to move the `is` rule adjacent to both `baba` and `win` in one go. But that's unlikely. So perhaps first make ""baba is win"" by moving `is` next to both.

Alternatively, since the current rule is ""baba is you"", and the goal is to be ""win"", maybe push the ball to the door? But the door is at 7 right, 1 down. There's a `ball` at 7 right, 2 down. Maybe move the ball to the door, but the door is a `door` rule, which might require pushing. However, the `stop` rule is at 2 right, 1 down, which could block movement.

Alternatively, change the rule to make ""door is win"", but that requires accessing the `door` and `win` rules. The `win` is at 8 right, 2 up. The `door` is at 7 right, 1 down. Not sure.

Another angle: the `ball` is at 2 steps up. Maybe pushing the ball towards the `win` rule. But how? If ""baba is you"", and there's no rule allowing pushing, unless you can create a rule like ""ball is push"" or something. But currently, the only rule is ""baba is you"".

Alternatively, use the ball as a tool. If I can move the ball next to the `win` rule, maybe that triggers something. But I don't think so in Baba Is You.

Back to the original plan: create ""baba is win"" by moving the `is` rule next to both. So, need to move the `is` rule from its current position (1 left, 2 up) to be adjacent to `baba` (2 left, 4 down) and `win` (8 right, 2 up). That seems impossible in one move. So perhaps first create ""baba is win"" by moving `is` next to `baba` and then move `is` next to `win`, but that would require two separate actions.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. The `is` rule is at 1 left, 2 up. The `win` is at 8 right, 2 up. So vertically aligned on the same horizontal line (2 up). The distance is 7 steps to the right. If I can move the `is` rule all the way to the right, past the `win` rule, then place it between `baba` and `win`.

But moving the `is` rule 7 steps to the right would require pushing past other objects. The `win` rule is at 8 right, 2 up. So moving the `is` rule to 8 right, 2 up would place it next to `win`. Then, if `baba` is also next to it, but `baba` is at 2 left, 4 down. Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

1. Current position: Baba at 2 left, 4 down.
2. Need to move to the `is` rule at 1 left, 2 up.
3. To get there, move left once (to 1 left, 4 down), then up twice (to 1 left, 2 down, then to 1 left, 1 down, then to 1 left, 0 down, then to 1 left, -1 down). Wait, but the `is` rule is at 1 left, 2 up, which would be coordinates relative to Baba's starting point. Maybe I'm mixing up the coordinate system.

Alternatively, assuming Baba is at position (0,0), then the `is` rule is at (-1, 2). The `win` is at (7, 2). The ball is at (0, 2). The walls are at (-2, 1), (3, 2), etc.

So to reach the `is` rule at (-1, 2), Baba needs to move left once (to -1,0) then up twice (to -1, 2). But moving up from (0,0) to (0,1), (0,2). But there's a wall at (-2,1), which is two left and one up from origin. So that's not on the path to (-1,2).

Once at (-1,2), the `is` rule is there. Then, pick up the `is` rule and move it. The goal is to move it to be adjacent to both `baba` (at 0,0) and `win` (7,2). So placing the `is` rule at (0,1) would be adjacent to `baba` at (0,0) and adjacent to `win` at (7,2)? No, that's not adjacent. Adjacent would be next to either horizontally or vertically.

Wait, to create ""baba is win"", the `is` rule needs to be between `baba` and `win`. So if `baba` is at (0,0) and `win` is at (7,2), the `is` rule needs to be at (0,1) to connect `baba` (0,0) and `win` (7,2). But that's not adjacent to both. Alternatively, place the `is` rule next to `baba` and then next to `win` in two moves.

This is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to first make ""baba is win"" by moving the `is` rule next to both. Since the `win` is far away, perhaps it's easier to first make ""baba is win"" by moving the `is` rule next to `baba` and then `win`, but that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""win is you"", but that would require changing the existing rules.

Another idea: The `ball` is at (0,2). If I can move the ball to the `win` location, maybe that works. But how? There's a `door` at (7,1) and a `stop` at (2,1). The path from `ball` (0,2) to `win` (7,2) is blocked by the `stop` at (2,1) and walls. So can't go straight right.

Alternatively, use the `door` somehow. If the `door` can be opened, but I don't have a key. The `ball` is a key in some levels, but I need to check if there's a rule allowing that. Currently, the rules are ""baba is you"". No rules about doors or keys.

Hmm. Maybe I need to prioritize moving the `is` rule. Let's try to get Baba to the `is` rule first.

From current position (0,0), move left once to (-1,0), then up once to (-1,1), then up again to (-1,2) to reach the `is` rule. But check if there are walls in the way. The wall at (-2,1) is two left and one up from origin, which is at (-2,1), so that's not on the path to (-1,2). So movement should be possible.

Once at (-1,2) with the `is` rule, pick it up and move it. The goal is to move it next to `baba` (0,0) and `win` (7,2). Let's try moving the `is` rule down to (0,1), which is adjacent to `baba` at (0,0). Then, from (0,1), move the `is` rule to (7,2), but that's a long way. Alternatively, once `is` is at (0,1), create the rule ""baba is win"" because `baba` is at (0,0), `is` at (0,1), and `win` is at (7,2). Wait, no, the `win` is not adjacent to `is` at (0,1). So that wouldn't work.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the solution is simpler. Since the current rule is ""baba is you"", and the goal is to reach the `win` object, perhaps the intended solution is to move the `win` rule next to Baba by rearranging the `is` rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a `win` at (7,2). If I can move the `is` rule to be next to `baba` and `win`, then ""baba is win"" would be created. But the distance between `baba` (0,0) and `win` (7,2) is large. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the `is` rule is at (-1,2). If I move it right to (0,2), then down to (0,1), then right to (1,1), etc., but this might not reach `win` in time.

Alternatively, push the `is` rule all the way to the `win` by moving right repeatedly. But each move would require being adjacent to the `is` rule and moving it one step.

Alternatively, realize that the `win` is at (7,2), and the `is` rule is at (-1,2). So they are on the same horizontal line. If I can move the `is` rule from (-1,2) to (7,2), passing through (0,2), (1,2), ..., (7,2), then place it next to `win`. But there's a `wall` at (3,2), which blocks that path. So movement can't go through (3,2).

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to first move the `is` rule to a different position. For example, move it","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you"". The goal seems to be reaching the ""win"" object, which is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But there are walls and stops in the way. Looking at the objects:

- The player (Baba) is at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. There's a rule ""you"" at 4 steps down, so that's correctly placed.
- The ""win"" is far to the right. To get there, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and the path is blocked by walls and a stop at 2 steps right and 1 step down. The door is at 7 steps right and 1 step down, but I don't know if that's passable.

Looking at the rules, ""baba is you"" means I can move freely unless there's a STOP. The walls are defined by ""wall"", but since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can push or move walls? Wait, in Baba Is You, usually, you can push objects that are not STOP. But here, walls are STOP? Let me check the active rules. There's no explicit ""wall is stop"" rule here. Wait, the initial setup might have some default rules. Oh, but the current active rules are only ""baba is you"". So walls might not be STOP unless there's a rule saying so. Wait, in the observation, there's a rule ""wall"" at 2 step to the left and 1 step up. Wait, no, the objects list includes ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". That means the rule ""wall is [something]"". Let me check the active rules. The active rules listed are just ""baba is you"". So maybe the walls are not STOP because there's no ""wall is stop"" rule. That changes things!

So if walls aren't STOP, I can walk through them? Or maybe the walls are just objects that block movement unless pushed. Wait, in Baba Is You, typically, if an object is defined as STOP, you can't move through it. But if there's no such rule, you can. Since the active rules here only have ""baba is you"", and the walls are just there as objects, maybe I can move past them? But in the map layout, the path to the right is blocked by walls. For example, at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps up is a wall. So if I try to go right, I might hit that wall unless I can push it. But to push a wall, there needs to be a rule allowing it, like ""push is you"" or something. But I don't see such a rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to rearrange the rules. The rule ""is"" is present at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` 1 step left and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to change a property. The ball is at 2 steps up, and there's a rule `is` near it. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I could make a new rule like ""ball is win"" or ""ball is you"". Let's see.

The player is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps up. To get to that ""is"" rule, I need to move up and left. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the position. The player is at (assuming current position is 0,0):

Baba's position: 2 left, 4 down. So coordinates (-2, -4).

The ""is"" rule is 1 step left and 2 steps up from somewhere. Wait, the observation says the rule `is` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. So relative to Baba's position? Or absolute? The way the observations are described, it's relative to the player's position. For example, ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" would be to the left of Baba's current position.

So if Baba is at (-2, -4), then a rule `is` 1 step to the left would be at (-3, -4), and 2 steps up would be (-3, -2). But I need to confirm how the positions are structured. Alternatively, maybe the positions are absolute. This is a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at a certain coordinate, and other objects are positioned relative to that. For example, if the player is at (0,0), then:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left would be at (-1, 0)
- ball 2 step up would be at (0, 2)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up would be at (3, 2)

But in the current observation, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so Baba is the player. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is at (7, 2) if we consider the player at (0,0). The walls are at (3,2), (3,1), etc. The ""stop"" rule is at (2, -1), which might mean that moving to (2, -1) is blocked.

But since the player can move unless there's a STOP rule, and the current rules don't have any STOP except the ""stop"" object, which is a separate entity. So the ""stop"" object is a wall that you can't move through. So to get to the win object at (7,2), I need to navigate around the walls.

Looking at the path:

From (0,0) (assuming Baba's position), the win is at (8,2) (since it's 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up). But between there are walls at (3,2), (5,1), etc. So the direct path is blocked. Maybe I need to find a way to push walls or use other rules.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to change the ""win"" rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would make Baba the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

The ""is"" rule is at (-1, 0) (1 step left of Baba). If I can move that ""is"" rule to be between ""baba"" and ""win"", then I can create ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the right.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks that are not STOP. The ""is"" rule is a text block, so if it's not STOP, I can move it. Looking at the objects, are there any STOP properties? The ""stop"" object is at (2,-1), but that's a separate object, not a rule. The active rules are only ""baba is you"". So the ""is"" rule can be moved.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from (-1,0) to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"". For example, move it right to create ""baba is win"".

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the right. The current position of the ""is"" rule is 1 step left of Baba. So to get it to align with Baba and the win object, I need to move right twice (from (-1,0) to (0,0) to (1,0)), but I have to check if the path is clear.

But the player is at (0,0), so moving the ""is"" rule right would require being adjacent to it. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move text blocks that are adjacent to you. So the player needs to be next to the text block to move it.

So the steps would be:

- Move the player to the position of the ""is"" rule. Since the ""is"" rule is 1 step left of Baba, the player is already adjacent to it. Wait, if the ""is"" rule is 1 step left of Baba's current position (assuming Baba is at (0,0)), then the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). The player is at (0,0), so they are adjacent. Therefore, the player can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it.

So the action would be to move right towards the ""is"" rule, but wait, the player is already at (0,0), and the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). So to pick it up, the player needs to move left once to reach (-1,0), then move it around.

Wait, no. If the player is at (0,0) and the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0), the player is adjacent to it. So the player can move the ""is"" rule by moving in the direction they push it. For example, if the player is at (0,0) and the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0), the player can move left to be on top of the ""is"" rule, then move in a direction to push it.

But in the game, to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which pushes the block. So the sequence would be:

1. Player is at (0,0).
2. ""is"" rule is at (-1,0).
3. Player moves left to (-1,0), then moves left again to push the ""is"" rule to (-2,0).
But wait, can the player move into the ""is"" rule? If the ""is"" rule is a text block, and there's no rule saying it's STOP, the player can move onto it. So first, move left to (-1,0) (onto the ""is"" rule), then move left again to push it to (-2,0).

Once the ""is"" rule is at (-2,0), the player can then move right to (0,0), and then move up to (0,1), etc., to position the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win"".

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. The ""win"" is at (8,2). If the player can create a rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win"", then touching the win object would make the player the win condition.

So to create ""baba is win"":

- Position the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win"".
- ""baba"" is at (0,0), ""win"" is at (8,2). The ""is"" rule needs to be at (0,0) and (8,2), which isn't possible. So instead, the ""is"" rule should be adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"" in the same cell. For example, place the ""is"" rule in a cell that is adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"". But given their positions, that's not feasible. So perhaps the correct way is to have ""baba is win"" as a vertical or horizontal rule.

Wait, in Baba Is You, rules can be created either horizontally or vertically. For example, ""BABA IS YOU"" is a horizontal rule. To create ""BABA IS WIN"", the ""is"" must be between ""baba"" and ""win"".

Given that the ""win"" is far to the right, maybe the player needs to move the ""is"" rule close to both ""baba"" and ""win"". But that's challenging given the map layout.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to make the ball the win condition. There's a ball at 2 steps up (0,2). If I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win the level.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win"". The ""is"" rule is currently at (-1,0). The ball is at (0,2), and the win is at (8,2).

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from (-1,0) to (0,2) (next to the ball), creating ""ball is ..."", then add ""win"" next to it.

But how? The ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). The player is at (0,0). To reach the ball at (0,2), the player needs to move up twice. But the path is blocked by walls at (3,2), etc. Wait, no, the walls are at (3,2) and others, but the player is at (0,0), so moving up two steps would be to (0,2), which is the ball's position. But is there a wall there? The ball is at (0,2), and there's a wall at (3,2), but between (0,2) and (3,2), there's no wall mentioned. So the player can move up to (0,2) where the ball is.

But the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). The player needs to move to (-1,0), pick up the ""is"" rule, and move it to (0,2). Let's see:

- Player is at (0,0). Move left to (-1,0) (onto the ""is"" rule).
- Then move up to (-1,1), then right to (0,1), then up to (0,2). But the ""is"" rule is being carried, so it moves with the player. So when the player moves up from (-1,0) to (-1,1), the ""is"" rule moves to (-1,1). Then moving right to (0,1), ""is"" is at (0,1). Then up to (0,2), placing the ""is"" rule there. Now, the rule would be ""ball is [something]"", but we need to append ""win"" next to it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, to create a rule like ""ball is win"", you need the ""is"" to be between ""ball"" and ""win"". So if the player places the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then appends ""win"" next to it. But how?

Alternatively, after placing the ""is"" rule next to the ball, the player can move to the ""win"" object and append ""win"" to the rule. But the ""win"" is far away.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think differently. The current active rule is ""baba is you"". The player is Baba, so touching the win object would win, but it's blocked by walls. Alternatively, if the player can make a rule that says ""baba is win"", then touching any part of the map would make them win.

To create ""baba is win"", the ""is"" rule needs to be between ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" is at (0,0), and ""win"" is at (8,2). The ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). So the player needs to move the ""is"" rule to a position where it's adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"". That's not possible in a straight line, but maybe diagonally?

Alternatively, create a vertical rule. For example, place ""baba"" above ""is"" above ""win"". So:

BABA
IS
WIN

In this case, the rule ""baba is win"" would be created. To do this, the player needs to move the ""is"" rule above ""baba"" and then place ""win"" below it. But the ""win"" is far to the right, so this might not be feasible.

Another approach: The door at (7,1 step down) might be a clue. If the player can push the door open by changing a rule, like ""door is push"" or something. But there's no such rule currently.

Alternatively, maybe the ball is the key. If the ball is at (0,2), and there's a rule ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win. To create that rule, the player needs to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to the win.

But the win is at (8,2). The distance is too big. Maybe the player can move the ""win"" rule closer? The ""win"" rule is at (8,2), which is fixed. Unless the player can move it, but there's no rule allowing that.

Wait, the ""win"" is an object, not a text block. Text blocks can be moved if they're not STOP. The ""win"" object is probably a static object defined by a text block like ""rule `win` ..."". So if the player can move that text block, they could relocate the win condition. But to move it, they need to be adjacent to the text block and move in a direction, which would require the text block not to be STOP.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at (9,2) steps. The text block for ""win"" is at (9,2). If the player can move that text block, they could bring the win condition closer. But again, the player would need to be adjacent to it and move it.

The player's current position is (0,0). The ""win"" rule is at (8,2). The distance is 8 steps to the right and 2 up. That's quite far. The player would need to navigate through the map, avoiding walls.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the walls aside. For example, if there's a rule allowing pushing, but there isn't any. The player is Baba, and the only rule is ""baba is you"". So the player can move, but cannot push unless there's a rule like ""push is you"".

Since there's no such rule, the player can't push walls. So the path is blocked.

Back to the rules. If the player can create a rule that makes the ball the win condition, that might be easier. The ball is at (0,2), which is directly above the player. If the player can create ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win.

To do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then next to ""win"". But ""win"" is far away. Alternatively, create a horizontal rule: ""ball is win"" by placing the ""is"" between them.

The ball is at (0,2), the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). The player needs to get to the ball's position, which is up two steps. But the path is clear? From (0,0) to (0,2), there's no wall mentioned in between. The","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and push objects unless they're defined as STOP or similar. The goal seems to be reaching the ""win"" object, which is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up.

Looking at the map, there's a ball at 2 steps up, and a wall directly to its right at 3 steps right and 2 steps up. The ""win"" is past that wall. There's also a ""stop"" object at 2 steps right and 1 step down, which I probably can't move through. Then there's a door at 7 steps right and 1 step down; maybe that's a way through if I can open it or avoid it. 

The rule ""is"" is located at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" to attach to ""wall"" and make it ""wall is stop,"" that might block something. But I need to see if I can reach the ""is"" rule. 

Baba's position is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. The ""you"" rule is at 4 steps down, so maybe I need to get closer to that. The ""is"" rule there is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. If I can move that ""is"" to make ""baba is win,"" then I could become the win condition. 

But right now, the main obstacle is the wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up blocking the path to the ""win"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. Wait, the ball is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe if I push the ball to the right, maybe it'll move the wall? But the wall is a solid STOP object, so pushing might not work. Or perhaps if I redefine the wall's property. 

Looking at the rule ""is"" at 1 step left and 2 steps up, if I move it next to ""wall"" and make it ""wall is stop,"" that's already the case. Hmm. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you"" or something, but that might not help. 

Another angle: the ""door"" at 7 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe I need to get past the door. But how? Unless there's a way to open it by creating a ""door is open"" rule. But I don't see an ""open"" property mentioned. 

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 2 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and make ""ball is win,"" then the ball would become the win condition. Then I could push the ball to where I am or to the intended spot. Let me check the positions. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. If I move right twice, I can get to the ""ball."" Then rearrange the ""is"" to say ""ball is win."" Once that's done, the ball would be the win, so touching it would complete the level. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and not be blocked by a STOP. The current position of Baba is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. To reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 2 steps up, I need to move up and right. Let's see: from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), moving up once gets to 2 left, 3 down. Then right once to 1 left, 3 down. Then up again to 1 left, 2 down. Then up once more to 1 left, 2 up. There, I can pick up the ""is"" rule. 

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I need to move it to the ""ball"" which is at 2 right, 2 up. But moving from 1 left, 2 up to 2 right, 2 up requires moving right twice. However, there's a wall at 3 right, 2 up, which is a STOP. So I can't push past it. Unless I move the wall first. But how? The wall is defined as ""wall is stop,"" so unless I change that rule, I can't move it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows moving the wall. For example, if I make ""stop is push,"" but I don't have that rule. The only rules are ""baba is you"" and the existing ""is"" rules. 

Wait, maybe instead of moving the ""is"" to the ball, I can create a ""win"" rule elsewhere. The existing ""win"" is at 8 right, 2 up. But if I can make the ball the win by moving ""is"" next to ball and making ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. 

So the steps would be: 
1. Move from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down) to the ""is"" rule at (1 left, 2 up). 
   - Up, right, up, up. But need to check if path is clear. Between Baba and the ""is"" rule, are there walls? The wall at 3 right, 2 up is to the right of the ball, not blocking the path. The ""stop"" is at 2 right, 1 down, which is below. So moving up and right should be possible. 
2. Once I have the ""is"" rule, move it to the ball's position (2 right, 2 up). 
   - From (1 left, 2 up), move right twice. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 up. So can't move right past it. Unless I push the wall, but it's STOP. 
   - Alternative: Maybe move the ""is"" rule to a different location. If I can place it next to the ball, but the wall is in the way. 

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe another approach. The ""door"" at 7 right, 1 down. Maybe I need to get behind it to open it. But how? Unless there's a ""key"" somewhere, but I don't see one. 

Alternatively, look at the lower part. There's a ""you"" rule at 4 down. If I can make Baba the ""you"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to Baba. Currently, Baba is at 2 left, 4 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down. So if I move right once to the ""is"" rule, pick it up, then move left to Baba's position and place it there as ""baba is you,"" but that's already the active rule. Maybe make ""baba is win"" instead. 

From the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 4 down, move left to Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), place it there as ""baba is win."" Then Baba would be both you and win, so touching anywhere would win. But how to place the rule? 

So steps: 
1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 4 down. 
   - From Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), move left once. 
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule. 
3. Move left to Baba's position (2 left, 4 down). 
4. Place the ""is"" rule next to Baba to create ""baba is win."" 

Once that's done, the active rule becomes ""baba is win,"" meaning touching anything would make it a win. So I can just stay in place or move around and win. 

This seems feasible. Let's check the path. From initial position (2 left, 4 down) to the ""is"" rule (1 left, 4 down) is one step left. Then move left again to Baba's position (2 left, 4 down)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 4 down. To get there from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), move left once. Then, to place the rule next to Baba, which is at 2 left, 4 down, I need to move right once. So from 1 left, 4 down, move right to 2 left, 4 down (Baba's position), and place the ""is"" rule there as ""baba is win."" 

Yes, that would work. So the actions would be: left (to get the ""is"" rule), then right (to return to Baba's position), then place the ""is"" rule to make ""baba is win."" 

But the problem is that the output needs to be a single action: up, down, left, right, or idle. The reasoning process is to figure out the sequence, but the final answer must be one action. 

Wait, but in the current observation, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" and the goal is to make a move that leads to the solution. Since each action is a single step, maybe the immediate action is to move left to pick up the ""is"" rule. 

So the chosen action is left.

Let's see. The current rules are ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, Baba is the player. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" is at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. Doors can sometimes be opened or require specific actions. Then there's a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant yet.

The map layout: On the top_left, there's a rule ""is"" 2 steps up, a ball nearby, and a wall. To the right, more walls and rules. Below, a stop wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which means I can't move through it. The door is near the bottom right, maybe a path there?

Baba's position is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely unless there's a STOP property. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, so if I go that way, I can't pass. The ""door"" might require pushing or something else, but since I'm Baba and can push objects if they're defined as movable. Wait, but the current rules don't say ""baba is push"" or anything. So maybe I can't push yet.

The key here is to figure out how to reach the win condition. The win is on the top right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to change the wall into something passable. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" text block to a different position, or change its property.

Looking at the available text blocks: There are ""is"" rules at different positions. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, I could change its property. For instance, if I move ""is"" to the ""wall"" block, making ""wall is stop,"" but wait, ""stop"" is already a rule at 3 steps right and 1 down. Maybe changing the wall's property to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I need to make Baba into the win. If I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would be redundant. But how? Let's see the positions of the rules. There's a ""win"" rule at 9 right, 2 up. If I can move that ""win"" rule next to a ""baba"" rule, then ""baba is win"" would be created. But where is the ""baba"" rule? There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 left, 4 down, and a ""you"" rule at 1 right, 4 down. So if I can move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule, then combining them would create ""baba is win.""

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? The ""win"" is a text block at 9 right, 2 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent and move towards it, but I have to check if it's movable. Since the current rules only say ""baba is you,"" and nothing about moving text blocks unless they're not STOP. Are text blocks movable? In Baba Is You, typically, text blocks can be moved unless they're part of a STOP rule. Here, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 1 down. The ""win"" rule is not under STOP, so I can move it.

So the plan is: Move towards the ""win"" rule at 9 right, 2 up, pick it up, and move it near the ""baba"" rule. Then, combining them would make ""baba is win,"" so touching any win object (including yourself) would win the level.

But how to get to the ""win"" rule. Current position of Baba is 1 left, 4 down. Let's see the path. From there, moving right would pass through walls at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls at 4 steps right are in various positions. Maybe need to navigate around them. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to change properties.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door that needs to be opened. The door is at 8 right, 1 down. To open a door, sometimes you need to push it or have the correct property. If I can make Baba a key or something, but I don't see a key object here.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can push the ball, maybe onto the door to open it. But since I'm Baba and the rules are ""baba is you,"" unless there's a ""push"" rule, I can't push. Wait, in some levels, moving towards an object allows you to push it if it's not STOP. But here, the ball's property isn't specified. The ""ball"" rule is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move that ""ball"" rule next to the door, maybe... Not sure.

Back to the original idea: Move the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" rule. To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" rule's position (9 right, 2 up). But the path is blocked by walls. Let's check the map again.

Looking at the objects:

- Top left: rule `is` 2 up, ball 1 right 2 up, wall 4 right 2 up.
- Right side: more walls and rules.
- Bottom: stop at 3 right 1 down, door at 8 right 1 down.

Baba is at 1 left 4 down. To get to the ""win"" rule at 9 right 2 up, need to move right multiple times. But between Baba and the ""win"" rule, there's a wall at 4 right 2 up. So moving directly right from Baba's position (1 left 4 down) to reach the ""win"" would require passing through 4 steps right, but there's a wall at 4 right 2 up, which is on the top row. Wait, maybe the path is blocked by walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe move up first. From Baba's position (1 left 4 down), moving up to 1 left 3 down, then 1 left 2 down, then 1 left 1 down, then 1 left 0 down (which is the same as 1 left), and then right? But not sure.

Alternatively, look for movable objects. The ""is"" rule at 2 up is movable. If I can move that ""is"" rule to modify another rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left 1 up, making ""wall is [something]"". But the current ""wall"" rule is at 2 left 1 up. Wait, the ""wall"" rule is 2 step to the left and 1 step up. So if I move the ""is"" rule (which is at 2 up) to be next to the ""wall"" rule, then I can change the wall's property.

But how to get the ""is"" rule. Baba is at 1 left 4 down. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps up from there. So moving up twice would get to the ""is"" rule. Let's see:

Baba's position: 1 left 4 down.

Move up once: 1 left 3 down.

Move up again: 1 left 2 down. Now, is there an ""is"" rule here? No, the ""is"" rule is 2 steps up from the original position. Wait, the initial observation had the ""is"" rule at 2 step up. So from Baba's starting position (which is rule `baba` at 1 left 4 down), moving up two steps would reach the ""is"" rule at 2 step up.

Wait, the initial observation's objects included rule `is` 2 step up from Baba's position. So if I move up twice from Baba's current position (1 left 4 down), I reach the ""is"" rule at 2 step up. Then, I can pick up that ""is"" rule and move it to another location to modify a property.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it to the ""wall"" rule to change its property. For example, moving ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule (which is at 2 left 1 up) to create ""wall is [something]"". But where is the ""wall"" rule located?

Looking back: The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step up. So from Baba's original position (1 left 4 down), the ""wall"" rule is 2 left and 1 up. That would place it at coordinates: left 1 + 2 left = 3 left? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This part is a bit confusing. The description says objects are at positions relative to Baba, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is a grid where each step is relative. For example, moving right increases the x-coordinate, up increases the y-coordinate.

But regardless, the key is to manipulate the ""is"" rules to change properties. The ultimate goal is to make either the ""win"" condition apply to Baba or find a way past the walls.

Another approach: The ""door"" at 8 right 1 down. If I can make Baba a key, then the door can be opened. To make Baba a key, I need to create a rule ""baba is key"". To do that, I need to move the ""key"" text block or create it by combining rules. But there's no ""key"" rule here. Alternatively, if there's a rule like ""key is ..."", but I don't see it.

Alternatively, if the door can be pushed or opened by touching it, but doors usually require a key or specific property.

Alternatively, the ""stop"" rule at 3 right 1 down is blocking a path. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that wall, then I can pass through. To remove ""stop"", I need to break the rule ""stop is ..."". But the ""stop"" rule is a text block; if I can move it or destroy it. In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks unless they're STOP. Since the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right 1 down, and it's not itself STOP, so maybe I can move it.

But how does destroying rules work? Typically, you can push a text block into a ""noun"" to negate its rule. For example, pushing ""stop"" into ""wall"" would make ""wall is stop"" become ""wall is [nothing]"", effectively removing the stop property. But I don't see a ""wall"" nearby to do that.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that negates ""stop"". For example, ""stop is not stop"", but that's probably not possible in the game mechanics.

Back to the original plan: Get the ""win"" rule and move it next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" rule at 9 right 2 up. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From Baba's current position (1 left 4 down), moving right would go towards the walls at 4 right. So maybe go up first. Move up to 1 left 3 down, then up to 1 left 2 down. At this point, is there a path? There's a wall at 4 right 2 up, which is on the top row. Maybe moving left or right from there.

Alternatively, move right from Baba's position to 0 left 4 down, then up to 0 left 3 down, and so on. But not sure if that leads anywhere.

Another idea: Use the ""is"" rule to change the ball's property. If I can make the ball a WIN, then touching it would win. But the ball is at 8 right 2 down. To do that, move the ""win"" rule next to the ball. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right 2 up, which is diagonally opposite.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at 9 right 2 up.
2. Pick it up and move it to the ""baba"" rule (1 left 4 down) or near it to create ""baba is win"".
3. Once that rule is active, touching any win object (including Baba) would win.

But how to move the ""win"" rule. Since it's a text block, and the only rule is ""baba is you"", which allows moving objects unless they're STOP. The ""win"" rule isn't STOP, so it can be moved.

Baba's current position is 1 left 4 down. The ""win"" rule is 9 right 2 up. The difference in coordinates is x: 9 right (which is +8 if starting from 0), y: +2 up. So from Baba's position (assuming starting at 0,0), moving right 8 and up 2. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 right.

Alternative route: Move up first to avoid walls. From 1 left 4 down, move up to 1 left 3 down, then up to 1 left 2 down. Now, at 1 left 2 down, can I move right? To the right would be 0 left 2 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 4 right 2 up is on the top, so maybe not in this path. From 0 left 2 down, move right to 1 left 2 down, then continue right. But there's a wall at 4 right, so maybe not.

Alternatively, after moving up to 1 left 2 down, move right to 2 left 2 down, then right to 3 left 2 down, then right to 4 left 2 down, which is a wall. So stuck there.

Hmm. Maybe need to use the ""is"" rule to change a wall into something movable. For example, if I can make the wall at 4 right 2 up into a ""push"" or remove its ""stop"" property.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left 1 up. So from Baba's position (1 left 4 down), moving left to 2 left 4 down, then up to 2 left 3 down, up to 2 left 2 down, up to 2 left 1 down, then left to 2 left 0 down (which is the wall rule's position: 2 left 1 up). Wait, this is getting confusing with directions. Maybe it's better to think in terms of relative movements.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" rule to the ""wall"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 2 step up from Baba's original position. So moving up twice gets there. Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to the ""wall"" rule's location. Then combine them to create ""wall is [property]"".

For example, moving ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule would make ""wall is [something]"". If I can make it ""wall is you"", then walls become passable. But that might not help directly. Alternatively, make ""wall is stop"" to reinforce it, but that's not useful.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""ball"" to create ""ball is you"", allowing me to control the ball. Then push the ball into the door or something. But the door is at 8 right 1 down. If the ball is a YOU, can I push it through the door? Not sure.

This is tricky. Let's think differently. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right 4 down. If I can make Baba the ""you"", but he already is. The active rule is ""baba is you"". So that's set.

The ""win"" is at 9 right 2 up. If I can reach it, but the path is blocked. Maybe use the ""door"" at 8 right 1 down. If I can open the door, then proceed through. To open a door, you usually need to be a KEY. So if I can make Baba a KEY, then the door can be opened.

To make Baba a KEY, create the rule ""baba is key"". To do that, need a ""key"" text block. But there's no key on the map. Alternatively, use existing rules. If there's a ""key"" rule somewhere, but I don't see it. Alternatively, create ""key"" by combining other rules. Not sure.

Alternatively, if the door can be pushed. If the door is a PUSH object, but it's defined as a door. doors are typically not pushable unless specified.

Another approach: The ""stop"" wall at 3 right 1 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that wall, then I can pass through. To do that, I need to push the ""stop"" rule into something. For example, if there's a ""noun"" next to it, pushing ""stop"" into it would negate the rule. But I don't see a relevant noun there.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule away. Since it's a text block, I can move it if it's not STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right 1 down. Moving it left or right. If I move it to a different position, the ""stop"" property would move with it. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule to 4 right 1 down, then the original position at 3 right 1 down no longer has a STOP rule, so that wall is no longer STOP.

But how does that help? Maybe then I can move through that area. But I'm not sure if that's the best path.

Back to the initial idea: Get the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" rule. To do that, move right towards the ""win"" position, avoiding walls. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 right. Maybe go around through the lower path.

From Baba's position (1 left 4 down), move down to 1 left 5 down (if possible), but looking at the map, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down. So maybe not.

Alternatively, move left from Baba's position to 0 left 4 down, then up to 0 left 3 down, then right to 1 left 3 down, and so on. But this is getting too vague without a visual map.

Perhaps the correct action is to move towards the ""win"" rule, picking it up and moving it to the ""baba"" rule. The steps would be:

1. From","

24,up,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out what action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate text blocks to change the rules.

The objects on the map are positioned as follows:
- There's a ""rule `is`"" 2 steps up.
- A ""ball"" is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up.
- A ""wall"" is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up.
- Another ""rule `is`"" is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps up.
- The ""win"" object is 9 steps to the right and 2 steps up.
- There are several walls and other rules positioned downwards.

My goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually at the far right. But the path is blocked by walls and a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Also, there's a ""door"" 8 steps to the right and 1 step down, which might require a key or something, but I don't see a key here.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The key here is to manipulate the rules. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are important. If I can move them to create new rules, maybe I can make the ball a win condition or remove the stop property from the wall.

Looking at the ball: it's 1 step right and 2 steps up from the starting point. If I can move the ""rule `is`"" that's 2 steps up to be next to the ball, I could say ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win object. Alternatively, moving a ""rule `you`"" to the ball would make me the ball, allowing me to step on it. But I don't see a ""you"" rule near the ball.

Another option is to interact with the existing ""rule `you`"" at 1 step right and 4 steps down. If I can get there, maybe I can combine it with the ball. But the path down there is blocked by walls. The ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps down could be moved to change something there.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps up is nearby the ball. If I move that ""is"" next to the ball, I can create ""ball is win."" To do that, I need to push the ""is"" rule to the left or right. The ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up from the starting position. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps up. So if I move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be adjacent to the ball. Then I can say ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win object.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba, I can move objects unless they're stopped. The ""rule `is`"" isn't stopped, so I can push it. From the current position, I need to move right to reach the ""is"" rule. Let me check the positions again.

The starting position isn't specified, but based on the objects, I assume I'm somewhere near the lower part. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 4 steps down, and there's a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 4 steps down. Maybe I'm at the lower left near the ""baba"" rule.

To reach the ""is"" rule at 2 steps up, I need to move up twice. But there's a wall 1 step left and 1 step up. Wait, no—the wall at 1 step left and 1 step up is a separate object. The path up might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe I can move right first to get past the wall.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball. The ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps up. So if I move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be at 1 step right and 2 steps up, adjacent to the ball. Then, combining them would create ""ball is win.""

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push the ""is"" rule. So the steps would be: move up twice to reach the ""is"" rule at 2 steps up, then move right once to place it next to the ball. Then, the rule would read ""ball is win,"" allowing me to move onto the ball to win.

But wait, how do I get to the ""is"" rule? The initial position isn't clear, but assuming I'm near the lower part where the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules are. If I move right once, I can get to the ""you"" rule, then up to the ""is"" rule at 4 steps down. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, from the starting position, move up twice to reach the ""is"" rule at 2 steps up. Then move right to place it next to the ball. But the ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up. So moving the ""is"" rule right from 2 steps up would make it 1 step right and 2 steps up, adjacent to the ball. That would create ""ball is win.""

So the sequence would be: move up twice to reach the ""is"" rule, then move right to place it next to the ball. Then, move to the ball and step on it, winning the level.

However, the problem is that the path might be blocked. Let me check the surrounding objects. There's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So if I'm moving right from the ""is"" rule, there's a wall blocking the way. Wait, the wall is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The ""is"" rule is at 2 steps up, and the ball is 1 step right and 2 steps up. So the ""is"" rule is two steps up from the starting point, and the ball is to the right of that.

If I'm at the starting point (assuming it's near the lower left), moving up twice gets me to the ""is"" rule. Then, moving right from there would take me towards the ball, but there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. So between the ""is"" rule and the ball, there's space to move right since the wall is at 4 steps right, which is further right than the ball's position (1 step right). So moving right from the ""is"" rule (which is at 2 steps up) one step would place it next to the ball (1 step right, 2 steps up), which is possible.

Therefore, the valid actions would be to move up twice to reach the ""is"" rule, then right once to place it next to the ball, creating ""ball is win."" Then move right to the ball and win.

But the user is asking for a single action to take based on the current observation. The current observation shows that the previous actions failed, possibly because the assistant didn't output a valid direction. The latest observation is the same as before, with active rules and objects as listed.

In the current state, the agent needs to choose an action: up, down, left, right, or idle. Looking at the map, the agent (Baba) is likely positioned somewhere near the lower left, given the ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So perhaps the agent is at 0,0 or similar coordinates.

To reach the ""is"" rule at 2 steps up, the agent needs to move up twice. But maybe there's a wall in the way. The wall at 1 step left and 1 step up is nearby. If the agent is at, say, position (0,0), moving up once would take them to (0,1), which has a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is 1 step left and 1 step up from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing without the actual grid layout.

Alternatively, focusing on the immediate possible actions. The agent needs to manipulate the ""is"" rule next to the ball. The closest ""is"" rule is 2 steps up. So moving up twice would get there. But if there's a wall blocking, maybe need to go around. However, the observations show a wall at 1 step left and 1 step up, which might be adjacent to the starting position. So moving up from the starting position might be possible if there's no wall in the way.

Assuming the agent can move up, the next step is to move up twice to reach the ""is"" rule, then right to place it next to the ball. But the problem is that the assistant needs to output a single action, not a sequence. So the first action should be to move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Looking at the previous actions, the assistant kept trying left and right, but maybe that's not the right path. Given the current observation, the best immediate action is to move up to reach the ""is"" rule. So the chosen action would be ""up.""

Let's try to figure this out. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around like Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is a door or something similar. Looking at the current observation, the ""win"" is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up.

Now, looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a ""rule `is`"" 1 step up. Maybe that's important. If I can move that rule, I could change some properties. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""win is you,"" that might help. But first, I need to see if I can move that ""is"" rule.

- The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. Not sure if that's relevant yet. Maybe there's a way to use the ball to push things, but since ""baba is you"" and the ball is just an object, unless there's a rule that allows pushing, I might not need it right now.

- The wall is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which makes objects or text blocks immovable. So I have to avoid those.

The path to the ""win"" is blocked by a wall at 4 steps right. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls? Wait, no, usually in Baba Is You, if there's a ""wall is stop,"" you can't pass through walls. But in the current rules, the only ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So maybe the walls here aren't stopped? Let me check the active rules again. The active rule is only ""baba is you."" There's no ""wall is stop"" mentioned here. Wait, looking back at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" which probably means ""wall is [something]."" But what? The initial setup might have had ""wall is stop,"" but maybe that rule has been moved or changed.

Wait, the objects listed include a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left."" So that rule is ""wall is [something],"" but the property isn't specified here. Maybe it's incomplete because the text block was moved? If ""wall is stop"" was there but the ""stop"" part is missing, then maybe walls aren't stoppable anymore. Or perhaps the rule is ""wall is"" with nothing, which would make walls passable. That could be possible.

So if I can get past the wall at 4 steps right by moving right, maybe I can reach the ""win"" at 9 steps right. Let me see the positions:

- My current position isn't explicitly stated, but the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up, and the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up. Assuming I'm Baba, maybe my position is at the starting point, which isn't listed here. Wait, the objects include ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 5 steps down,"" so Baba's text block is there, but where is Baba itself? Typically, Baba is an object on the map, possibly at the position of the ""baba"" rule or elsewhere. This might be a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, moving the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" to be next to ""baba"" so that it becomes ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't listed as stop, so I can move it.

Looking at the current positions:

- ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up. If I move up from my current position, I can grab that ""is"" rule. Then, take it to where the ""win"" is (9 steps right, 1 step up) and place it next to ""baba"" (which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down)? Wait, that might not be adjacent. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.

Wait, the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""win,"" making ""win is you"" or ""baba is win."" But where is Baba located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So if I can get the ""is"" rule near Baba, I can make ""baba is win,"" which would make reaching the win object cause Baba to win.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule up to where the ""win"" is. Let's see. The ""is"" rule is currently 1 step up. If I move up from there, maybe I can position it next to the ""win"" rule. But I need to know where I am. This is getting a bit tangled.

Another approach: Since the current rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move freely unless there's a stop rule. The wall at 4 steps right might not be stoppable if the ""wall is stop"" rule is missing. So maybe I can just move right past the wall towards the ""win"" at 9 steps right. Let's check the path:

From my current position (unknown), but assuming I'm near the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, moving right would take me towards the wall at 4 steps right. But the ""win"" is at 9 steps right, so after passing the wall at 4 steps right, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is below. So maybe moving right directly isn't blocked by a stop, just a wall. If walls aren't stoppable here, then moving right multiple times (4 steps right to reach the wall, then continue right to 9 steps) would work. But I need to confirm if walls are stoppable.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left,"" which might mean ""wall is"" something, but it's incomplete. If that rule was originally ""wall is stop"" but the ""stop"" part was moved, then walls aren't stoppable. Alternatively, if the rule is still ""wall is stop,"" then I can't pass through walls. But since the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, maybe the wall at 4 steps right is just a regular wall without the stop property. This is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules. For instance, take the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" and move it next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win."" That would make Baba the win condition, so if I reach Baba, I win. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If I make ""baba is win,"" then whenever Baba touches a win object, it's a win. But the win object is already there. Alternatively, making ""you is win"" would make the win object the you, so touching it would win.

Alternatively, if I can make ""win is you,"" then touching the win object would make me you, which I already am, but that might not help. Hmm.

Another possibility: The ""door"" at 8 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe that's a win condition if I can open it. But there's a ""rule `door`"" there, but no ""door is open"" or similar rule. So maybe the door is just a door and needs to be opened. But without a ""door is open"" rule, I can't open it. Unless I can move the ""rule `is`"" to create that.

This is getting complex. Let's recap:

- Current rules: ""baba is you.""
- Goal: Reach the ""win"" object (door at 9 steps right, 1 step up, or maybe the win tile).
- Obstacles: Wall at 4 steps right, but unclear if it's stoppable.
- Available rules: ""is"" rules that can be moved to create new rules.

Possible solution:

1. Move the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" to be next to ""win"" (9 steps right, 1 step up) to create ""win is you."" Since I'm you, touching the win would make me win.

But how to get the ""is"" rule there? If I'm at the position of the current ""is"" rule (1 step up), I need to move down to reach the area of the win. Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step up, and the win is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So they're in the same horizontal line, 8 steps apart. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the right 8 steps, placing it next to the ""win"" rule, then ""win is you"" would be created, making the win condition achievable by touching it.

But moving right 8 steps from the ""is"" rule's position (1 step up) would require passing through the wall at 4 steps right. If walls are passable, then possible. If not, then blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see the positions:

- ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step up. Suppose I'm adjacent to it. Moving up from there gets me to the same horizontal line as the win. Then moving right 8 steps to reach the win's position. But the wall at 4 steps right is in the way. If I can move around it, maybe by going down, but there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So moving down from the ""is"" rule's position (1 step up) to 2 steps up, then right? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to a different location. For example, moving the ""is"" rule down to be near the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down. Then create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up, which is far from where Baba is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. That seems impractical.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 2 step up. Maybe there's a rule involving the ball. For example, if I can make ""ball is push"" or ""ball is win,"" but I don't see a ""win"" rule associated with the ball.

Alternatively, using the ball to push the ""is"" rule. But unless there's a rule allowing pushing, which there isn't currently, I can't push objects. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, so I can move it manually.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" to the position next to the ""win"" object (9 steps right, 1 step up). This would create ""win is [property]."" What property? If I place it next to ""win,"" then the rule would be ""win is [something]."" To make it ""win is you,"" I need to have the ""you"" part somewhere. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. That's quite far from the win's position.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a significant distance. Maybe not feasible.

Another thought: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step right and 4 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""you"" and ""win,"" creating ""you is win,"" then touching the win would make me you (which I already am), but that might not trigger a win. Alternatively, ""win is you,"" which would make the win object act as you.

This is tricky. Let's think step by step.

Current position of mine (Baba): Not explicitly stated, but the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So maybe Baba is at that position, or nearby. If I'm at the ""baba"" rule's position, I can move around.

If I move up from there, I can reach the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. Then, take that ""is"" rule and move it to the ""win"" location. But moving right 8 steps would require passing through the wall at 4 steps right. If walls are passable (since there's no ""wall is stop"" rule active), then I can move through them. Let's assume that.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move up from Baba's position to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.
2. Grab the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right 8 steps to the ""win"" location.
4. Place the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" to create ""win is you.""

Then, moving to the ""win"" object would make me win.

But how to confirm if walls are passable. The active rules only have ""baba is you."" There's no ""wall is stop"" listed, which means walls might not block movement. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, but that's a separate object. So maybe the wall at 4 steps right is just a regular wall, and I can move through it.

Therefore, the valid action would be to move right repeatedly until reaching the ""win"" and placing the ""is"" rule there. But since the system requires choosing a single action, perhaps the first step is to move right to get closer.

Alternatively, check if there's a shorter path. From the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, moving right 8 steps to the ""win"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe the system expects a single action, like moving up to grab the ""is"" rule first.

Wait, the current observation shows that the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I'm adjacent to that ""is"" rule, I can move up to grab it. Then move right to place it next to the ""win.""

But the problem is that the assistant needs to output a single action. Given the current state, the best immediate action is probably to move up to reach the ""is"" rule so that it can be moved to create the desired rule.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around freely unless there's a ""stop"" or something like that blocking the way. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. So, if I can get there, that should solve the level. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another rule ""wall"" at 1 step to the left. Wait, the ""wall"" rule probably means that any object labeled ""wall"" is immovable. So, the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is blocking the direct path to the ""win"" object.

Hmm, maybe I can move the ""is"" text block to change the rules. There are several ""is"" blocks around. For example, one is at 1 step up, and another at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move one of these ""is"" rules to reassign properties, maybe I can make the wall not a stopper or change the win condition.

Looking at the positions, the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move past the wall at 4 steps right. But since I'm controlled by ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""push"" rule here, I can't push the wall. Unless... wait, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make the wall a different property. For instance, if I can make the wall a ""stop,"" but since I'm already ""baba,"" maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule elsewhere.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step to the left. If I can move that text block elsewhere, maybe I can remove the wall's property. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that says ""wall IS stop,"" but I don't see a ""stop"" rule here except for the ""stop"" block at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Not sure if that's useful.

Another angle: the ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe there's a way to interact with the ball, but the goal is ""win,"" which is a door perhaps? The ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door a win, but how? The current ""win"" is separate. Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba"" equivalent to ""win"" by moving an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Wait, there's a rule ""baba"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and ""is"" at 5 steps down. So, ""baba IS [something]."" If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" then maybe I become the win. Let's see: the ""is"" block is at 5 steps down. If I move it to be next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba IS win"" would make me the win condition. But how to get there?

Right now, my position isn't clear, but assuming I'm at the original position of ""baba,"" which might be moving around. Let's think about possible moves. The last action was ""up,"" which brought me to 1 step up. From there, if I move right towards the ""is"" block at 8 steps right and 1 step up, maybe I can pick up that ""is"" block and move it to connect ""baba"" with ""win.""

But wait, to move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not be blocked by a ""stop"" or an object defined as ""stop."" The path to the ""is"" block at 8 steps right and 1 step up might be clear. Let's check obstacles. From my current position at 1 step up, moving right towards the ""is"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. But since I'm ""baba is you,"" can I push through the wall? No, walls are stoppers unless there's a ""push"" rule. There's no ""push"" here, so I can't move through the wall.

Hmm, maybe I need to find another path. Alternatively, if I can make the wall not a stop. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" rule from 1 step left to somewhere else. The ""wall"" rule is a text block that says ""wall IS ..."", right? If I can move that text block, perhaps I can change what ""wall"" does.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that says ""stop IS nothing,"" but I don't have a text block for that. The available text blocks are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball."" So maybe rearrange these.

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door the win condition, that might work. But the current ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. To do that, I need to change the ""win"" rule. There's a rule ""win"" at 9 steps right and 2 step up. If I can move that ""win"" rule near the door, then ""door IS win"" would make the door the win. But how to get there?

Alternatively, since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""is"" block at 1 step up to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" The ""is"" block is currently at 1 step up. If I move it to be next to ""baba"" (which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down) and ""win"" (at 9 steps right and 1 step up), that might not be feasible because of the distance. Maybe I need to move closer.

Alternatively, look at the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 4 steps down. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe that's already set. But perhaps I need to adjust other rules.

Wait, there's a rule ""is"" at 4 steps down. If I can move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" that would do it. ""baba IS win"" would make me the win. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and the ""is"" block is at 5 steps down. So if I move the ""is"" from 5 steps down to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba IS win.""

To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""is"" block is at 5 steps down. From my current position at 1 step up, I can move down to reach 5 steps down. Let's see: current position after previous ""up"" action is 1 step up. To get to 5 steps down, I need to move down multiple times. But the path might be blocked. Let me check the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and various positions. If I'm at 1 step up, moving down would take me to the original position. From there, moving left or right might be possible. But I need to avoid ""stop"" objects. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So if I move down towards 5 steps down, I have to be careful not to hit that stop.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to me, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, make the ""door"" the win by moving the ""win"" rule there.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap:

- I am Baba, and ""baba is you.""
- Goal is to reach ""win,"" which is at 9 right, 1 up, but blocked by a wall.
- To bypass the wall, maybe change the wall's property or the win's location.
- Alternatively, make myself the win by creating ""baba IS win.""

To create ""baba IS win,"" I need to move the ""is"" block that's at 5 steps down to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" ""Baba"" is at 1 left, 5 down. ""Win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""is"" is at 5 down. So moving the ""is"" from 5 down to, say, 1 left, 5 down (next to baba) and then to 9 right, 1 up? That seems too far. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" block.

Wait, there's another ""is"" block at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" that might work. The ""is"" at 1 step up is between me (if I'm at 1 step up) and the ball at 1 right, 1 up. If I move that ""is"" block to the left to connect with ""baba,"" which is at 1 left, 5 down. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" at 8 right, 1 up (near the win) to connect ""win"" with something else. But I need to get there.

This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to head towards the ""is"" block at 8 right, 1 up to create a new rule. But how to get past the wall at 4 right, 1 up. Since I can't push walls, I need to go around. But where am I currently located?

Assuming my current position is where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 1 left, 5 down. To get to the ""is"" at 8 right, 1 up, I need to move right and up. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me visualize the map.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the ""ball"" to push something. But there's no ""push"" rule, so probably not.

Wait, the ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down. If I can move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere, maybe I can remove the obstacle. But how?

Another thought: if I can make ""wall"" equivalent to nothing, like ""wall IS nothing,"" then the wall wouldn't block. But there's no ""nothing"" object. Maybe ""wall IS stop"" is already there, but that's the default.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop IS YOU,"" which would let me move through stops. But I need to have the ""is"" block to do that.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""is"" block at 1 step up to pick it up.
2. Navigate around the walls to reach the area where ""baba"" and ""win"" are.
3. Place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba IS win,"" making me the win.

But navigating around the walls requires finding a path. From 1 step up, moving right is blocked by the wall at 4 right, 1 up. So maybe move down to the original position, then left or right?

If I move down from 1 step up to the original position (0 steps up), then I'm at the same spot as the ""baba"" rule. From there, maybe move left towards the ""is"" block at 1 left, 4 steps down. Wait, the ""is"" block is at 5 steps down. Hmm.

Alternatively, move right past the wall? But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up, and I'm at 1 up. So moving right from 1 up would take me towards the wall. Can't do that.

Maybe the solution is to move the ""wall"" rule from 1 left to somewhere else, allowing the path to be cleared. But how? To move the ""wall"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step to the left. If I can get to that position, I can pick up the ""wall"" rule and move it.

Assuming I'm at 1 step up, moving left would take me to the original position (0 up), then left again to 1 left. Is that possible? Let's see:

From 1 step up, moving left once would be at the same level as the original ""baba"" position (0 up). From there, moving left again to 1 left, which is where the ""wall"" rule is. If I can move there without hitting a stop.

But between my current position (1 up) and 1 left, is there a clear path? The ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down, which is not on this path. So moving left from 1 up to 0 up (original position) then left to 1 left should be possible. Then pick up the ""wall"" rule and move it elsewhere, like to 9 right, 1 up next to the ""win"" rule, changing it to ""wall IS win"" or something. Wait, no. The ""win"" rule is separate. Maybe moving the ""wall"" rule to where the ""stop"" is, removing its effect.

But this seems like a lot of steps. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Another angle: since I'm ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""you"" rule at 1 right, 4 down, which is probably connected to the ""baba is you"" rule. Maybe I can use that to my advantage.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""win IS YOU,"" but I need to have the ""is"" block nearby. The ""is"" block at 5 steps down could be moved to connect ""win"" and ""you.""

Wait, ""you"" is already part of the active rule ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""win IS YOU,"" then reaching the ""win"" object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 5 steps down to be between ""win"" and ""you.""

""Win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. ""You"" is at 1 right, 4 down. The ""is"" block is at 5 steps down. So moving the ""is"" block from 5 down to, say, 9 right, 1 up (near win) and then to 1 right, 4 down (near you) to create ""win IS YOU."" That could work.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""is"" block at 5 steps down, pick it up, and move it first to the ""win"" location, then to the ""you"" location. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" block at 1 step up can be used. If I move that one to connect ""win"" and ""you.""

This is really challenging. Let me try to outline possible moves step by step.

1. From current position (1 step up), move down to reach the original ""baba"" position (0 up).
2. From there, move left to reach the ""is"" block at 5 steps down. Wait, no, the ""is"" at 5 steps down is below. Maybe down from 0 up to 5 down.
3. Once at 5 down, pick up the ""is"" block.
4. Move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location (9 right, 1 up). That's a long distance, but possible by moving right and up.
5. Place the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you"" to create ""win IS YOU.""

But navigating around the walls and stops would be difficult. Alternatively, find a shorter path.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Move it to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" ""Baba"" is at 1 left, 5 down. The ""is"" is at 1 step up. If I move the ""is"" block down to 5 down, place it next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But how to get the ""is"" block from 1 up to 5 down. That would require moving down four steps. Possible? Yes, if the path isn't blocked. From 1 up, moving down to 0 up, then down to 1 down, 2 down, etc., until 5 down. Along the way, are there any stops? The ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down. If I'm moving vertically, not horizontally, maybe it's clear.

Assuming I can move straight down, pick up the ""is"" block at 1 step up, move it down to 5 down, place it next to ""baba"" (1 left, 5 down) and ""win"" (9 right, 1 up). But placing it between ""baba"" and ""win"" would require moving it left from 5 down to 1 left, which is possible if there's no wall.

This is getting too speculative. Given the time I've spent, maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 step up to pick it up and then start moving it towards the ""win"" location. But how to do that in the next action.

Current position after last action ""up"" is 1 step up. The closest ""is"" block is at 1 step up (same position?), or at 8 right, 1 up. Wait, the ""is"" blocks are at 1 step up and 8 right, 1 up. If I'm at 1 step up, the ""is"" block is adjacent? Let me check the observation:

Objects on the map include rule `is` 1 step up and rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the ""is"" blocks are at:

- 1 step up (same vertical level as me?)
- 8 steps to the right and 2 step up.

Assuming I'm at 1 step up, the ""is"" block at 1 step up is directly above or below? If I'm at 1 step up, and the ""is"" is also at 1 step up, then they're adjacent. So I can pick up that ""is"" block and move it.

Yes, if the ""is"" block is at the same vertical level (1 step up) and perhaps horizontally adjacent, then I can move it. For example, if the ""is"" is 1 step to the left or right of me at 1 step up, then I can pick it up.

Let's figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule positioned at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. However, there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 1 step down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. The walls are spread out, and there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which makes those objects immovable.

My position seems to be near the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. Wait, no—the player (Baba) is controlled by the ""baba is you"" rule. Let me check where Baba is located. There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So I'm at that position. The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely unless blocked by a ""stop"" or ""wall"" with ""stop"" property.

The main challenge here is navigating past the walls and the ""stop"" rule to reach the ""win"" object. Let's map out the path:

1. From my current position (1 left, 5 down), I need to move up to reach the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right and various positions. Let's see the path:

   - Moving up from 5 down to 1 step up: There's a ""wall"" at 1 step left, which is probably a wall to my left. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" might be a text block that says ""WALL IS ..."" but right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so walls are just obstacles unless their properties change.

   - To get to the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up, I need to avoid the walls. The path might involve moving right, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. Also, the ""stop"" at 3 right, 2 down could block movement if I go that way.

   Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are present. For example, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step up"" and another at 8 right, 1 up. Maybe I can move these rules to create new rules.

   If I can make ""win"" be ""you"" or change ""baba"" to have different properties, that might help. But since I'm already ""you,"" maybe I need to make ""win"" something else. Wait, the current goal is ""win,"" but perhaps there's a way to redefine ""win"" to be a movable object or a rule that allows me to reach it differently.

   Let me check the positions again. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. There's a ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down. Maybe pushing the ""door"" rule could help, but I need to see if I can move it. However, the ""door"" is likely a static object unless its rule is changed.

   Another approach: If I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching the ""win"" object would satisfy the condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

   Let's see. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win,"" that could work. But how? I need to move the ""is"" block, which might require moving it left or right.

   My current position is 1 left, 5 down. To reach the ""is"" at 1 step up, I can move up once. Then, from there, move right to the ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 5 down. Wait, no—the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down, which is my current position. So if I'm at the ""baba"" rule, and there's an ""is"" rule 1 step up, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule down to be next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

   Let's break it down:

   - Current position: rule `baba` at (1 left, 5 down). I am this object since ""baba is you.""

   - There's a ""rule `is`"" 1 step up from here. So if I move up once, I'm at the ""is"" rule.

   - From there, I need to move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" For example, moving the ""is"" rule to the right so that it says ""baba is win.""

   To move the ""is"" rule, I have to be next to it and move either left, right, up, or down, provided the path isn't blocked by a ""stop"" or ""wall.""

   So the steps could be:

   1. Move up from my current position (1 left,5 down) to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

   2. Then, move the ""is"" rule to the right until it's between ""baba"" and ""win.""

   But wait, ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""is"" rule is currently at 1 step up. To get to the ""win,"" I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So that path is blocked.

   Alternatively, maybe moving the ""is"" rule to the left to combine with ""baba"" and another property. For example, if I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching the ""win"" object would make me win.

   Let's try:

   - Move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

   - Then, move left to be next to the ""baba"" rule (which is at 1 left,5 down, but I'm now at 1 step up. Wait, positions might be relative. Maybe I need to adjust how the coordinates work here. The observations mention steps in directions, but the exact grid layout isn't visual. This is a bit abstract.

   Alternatively, perhaps the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down from the current ""is"" rule at 1 step up. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

   Another angle: The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. There's a ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down. Maybe pushing the ""door"" rule could reveal a path, but I need to check if doors are passable unless stopped by ""stop.""

   Considering the ""stop"" at 3 right, 2 down, which is two steps below the current ""is"" rule. If I can move around that, maybe by going through the door or finding an alternative path.

   Wait, maybe I can move the ""door"" rule to a different position. If I can make ""door"" a movable object by changing its rule. But currently, there's no active rule defining door's behavior except as a static object unless manipulated.

   Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is door,"" then stepping on the door would make me the door, which might have different properties. But I'm already ""you,"" so maybe that's not helpful.

   Let's recap the active rules: Only ""baba is you"" is active. All other rules like ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball"" are just text blocks that can be moved to create new rules.

   The key is to manipulate these text blocks to create a rule that allows me to reach the win condition. Since I'm Baba and can move, I need to either:

   - Move to the win object (but it's blocked by walls and stop rules).

   - Change the ""win"" object's definition so that it's something I can touch without obstacles.

   For example, if I can create a rule like ""win is baba,"" then touching Baba (which is me) would satisfy the win condition. But how?

   To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" rule. Let's see:

   - The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,5 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up from my current position.

   It's a bit far, but maybe possible by moving the ""is"" rule to connect them.

   Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" between them.

   So steps might be:

   1. Move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

   2. Move the ""is"" rule to the right towards the ""win"" location.

   3. Place the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win.""

   But navigating there might be blocked. There's a wall at 4 right, 1 up, which is between the current ""is"" position and the ""win."" So moving right from the ""is"" rule at 1 step up would hit the wall at 4 right, 1 up. Can't go that way.

   Maybe another approach: Use the ""door"" or ""ball"" to create a path. For example, if I can make ""door is push"" or something, but there's no ""push"" rule active.

   Alternatively, since there's a ""ball"" at 8 right, 2 down, maybe I can move the ""ball"" to be under the ""stop"" rule, allowing me to pass. But the ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down, which is two steps down from the current ""is"" rule. Not sure.

   Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. If I can move past it by going around, but there's a wall at 4 right, which might block that.

   This is tricky. Let's think differently. Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I need to reach the ""win"" object by moving around the walls. Let's check the path from my current position (1 left,5 down) to the ""win"" at 9 right,1 up.

   Moving up from 5 down to 1 up: There's a wall at 1 step left, which is probably a wall to my left. So moving up would require being to the right of that wall. But my current position is 1 left,5 down. So moving up would take me to (0 left,5 up?), but there's a wall at 1 step left,1 up. Not sure.

   Maybe the grid is aligned such that moving up from my current position brings me next to the ""is"" rule. Then, from there, moving right towards the ""win,"" but blocked by the wall at 4 right,1 up.

   Alternatively, move left from the ""is"" rule to reach the ""baba"" rule. If I combine ""baba"" with ""win"" via the ""is"" rule, that could work. So:

   - Move up to the ""is"" rule.

   - Move left to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule.

   - Then, move the ""is"" rule so that it says ""baba is win.""

   But how to do that? The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,5 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up from my current position, which is (assuming current position is at coordinates, say, (0,0), then moving up would be (0,1), left would be (-1,1), etc. This is getting too abstract without a visual.

   Perhaps the best action is to try moving towards the ""is"" rule to manipulate it. So, moving up once to get to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. Then, from there, move left or right to position the ""is"" correctly.

   Given the previous failed attempts and the defaulting to idle, maybe the correct action now is to move up to reach the ""is"" rule and then manipulate it. But the last observation after moving up had the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, and the active rules still included ""baba is you.""

   Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba is"" by rearranging the text blocks. For example, if there's a ""rule `is`"" somewhere that can be placed between ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

   Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, I think the next logical step is to move up to the ""is"" rule and then try to move it towards the ""win"" location to create the desired rule. So the action would be ""up"" to get to the ""is"" rule, then ""right"" to start moving it towards the ""win.""

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. That might be blocking the path. There's a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. The ""ball"" might be important because maybe I can push it or use it to create a new rule.

The ""is"" rules are scattered. One is at 1 step up, and another at 5 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule near the ""win"" or ""ball,"" I could change their properties. For example, if I make ""win"" into ""you"" or ""baba is win,"" that might help. But how do I move the ""is"" rule?

Baba's position is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""you"" rule is there too. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move around. Let's see the possible moves. Up would take me to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. If I go up, maybe I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it elsewhere.

If I move up once, I'm at the ""is"" rule. Then I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up. But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls or stops. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which is not directly in the way. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" position and change ""win"" to something else.

Alternatively, if I take the ""is"" rule and move it to the ""ball,"" making ""ball is win"" or ""ball is you,"" that could let me push the ball to the door or towards the win. But I need to reach the ""ball"" first. The ball is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. From my current position (1 step left and 5 steps down), moving right multiple times might get me closer. But there are walls at 4 steps right, so I have to navigate around them.

Wait, the ""stop"" at 3 steps right and 2 steps down could be a problem. If I go right, I might crash into a wall or stop. Let's map out the movement. From Baba's position (1 left, 5 down):

- Moving right: There's a wall at 4 steps right. So I can go right until step 3, but then there's a stop at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can push past it since ""baba is you"" and it's not a ""stop"" property unless defined. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm moving right, I might hit the wall at 4 steps right first. Hmm.

Alternatively, moving up towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. If I move up, I can pick up the ""is"" rule there. Then move it to the ""win"" position. Let's see: From 1 step up, moving right 8 steps would get me to the ""win"" at 9 steps right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. So I can only move right to 4 steps, then need to go around. Maybe down and then right? But that might complicate.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to make a new rule. For example, create ""win is push"" or something, but I need to manipulate the existing text blocks. The key is to find a way to reach the ""win"" or change the win condition.

Another thought: If I can make ""door"" into the win condition. There's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win."" But how?

Alternatively, maybe push the ""ball"" to the door. If ""ball is push,"" then I can push it. But again, need to set that up with the ""is"" rule.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's recap:

- I'm Baba, with ""baba is you.""
- Need to reach ""win"" or change the win condition.
- Obstacles: walls, stop, and maybe need to rearrange rules.
- Possible actions: move to pick up ""is"" rule and create new rules.

If I move up to the ""is"" at 1 step up, then move right to the ""win"" at 9 steps right. But path is blocked. Alternatively, take the ""is"" to the ""ball"" and make ""ball is win."" Then push the ball to where?

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I make ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would make it a win. But how to get there? From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving right to 4 steps, then down? Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" and change it to ""baba is win."" Then, since I'm Baba, touching the win would work. But the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. How to get there?

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to make ""you is win,"" but I'm already ""you"" because ""baba is you.""

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" and change its property. For example, ""win is push"" so I can push it. But I need to be able to push it. Alternatively, ""win is baba"" so touching it would work.

But I need to physically get to the ""win"" or manipulate the rules from a distance. Since I can move text blocks, maybe I can grab the ""is"" rule and move it to the ""win"" location and write a new rule.

So step by step:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.
2. Grab the ""is"" rule and move it to the ""win"" location (9 right, 1 up).
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""win"" and create a new rule like ""win is baba"" or ""baba is win.""

But how to do that in moves? Each move is a step in a direction. So from Baba's position (1 left, 5 down):

- Move up once to reach the ""is"" at 1 step up.
- Then move right 8 steps to reach the ""win"" at 9 steps right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. So can't go that way. Maybe another path.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, move right to 4 steps (past the wall?), then down and right? Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""ball"" and make ""ball is win."" Then push the ball to where? The ball is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I make ""ball is win,"" then standing on the ball would make it a win. So maybe push the ball towards me or to a accessible spot.

But to push the ball, I need to be next to it and move in the same direction. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can push objects. So if the ball is a pushable object, I can move towards it.

The ball's position is 8 right, 3 down. My current position is 1 left, 5 down. So to get to the ball:

- Move right 2 steps to get to x=0 (assuming left is negative), then down 2 steps to y=3. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, so maybe this path is blocked.

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" rule, then move right to 4 steps, then down to 2 steps down (avoiding the stop at 3 steps right and 2 steps down), then right again? Not sure.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""is"" rule near the ""win"" and create a rule that makes touching the win condition work. Since I'm Baba, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then standing on the win would win. But the win is at 9 right, 1 up. How to get there?

Alternatively, create ""win is you,"" but I'm already you. So touching the win would work. To do that, move the ""is"" to the win and write ""win is you.""

But how to reach the win's location. Let's see:

From current position (1 left, 5 down):

- Move up to 1 step up (position: 1 left, 4 down).
- Move right to 4 steps right (wall is at 4 steps right, so maybe I can move there? But the map says wall at 4 steps right. So can't move past that.
- Maybe move down to 5 steps down, then right? Not sure.

Wait, the walls are at specific positions. Let me check the objects again:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- etc.

So moving right from my position (1 left,5 down) to 4 steps right would hit a wall. So that's blocked. Maybe need to find another path.

Alternative approach: Use the existing ""is"" rule at 5 steps down. The rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. If I can move that ""is"" rule to the ""win"" location, maybe I can create a rule like ""win is baba.""

But how to get there. From 1 left,4 down to 9 right,1 up. That's a lot of movement. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 5 steps down. If I move up to there, then move the ""is"" rule to the ""win.""

From current position (1 left,5 down):

- Move down to 5 steps down (position: 1 left,6 down)? Wait, no. My current position is already at 5 steps down. The ""is"" is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. So to get there, move left and up.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinates. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming Baba starts at a certain point, but the exact coordinates are a bit unclear from the observations. The observations list objects with relative positions, like ""1 step to the left and 2 step up"" from somewhere. It's possible that the reference point is the player's position, but without a map layout, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, focus on the available text blocks. The critical ones are the ""is"" rules, ""win,"" and ""you."" Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I need to reach the ""win"" or change the rule to make something else a win.

Another idea: If I can make ""door is win,"" then moving to the door would win. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and write ""door is win.""

From my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down), moving right to 8 steps would reach the door's x-coordinate, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So need to find a path around.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule from 1 step up to near the door. Let's see:

- Move up to the ""is"" at 1 step up.
- Then move right to 8 steps right (passing through walls?), but walls are at 4 steps right. So can't get past that.

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to push the ""ball"" to the door and make the ball the win condition. If I make ""ball is win,"" then pushing the ball to where I am would make it a win. To do that:

1. Move to the ball's location (8 right,3 down).
2. Use the ""is"" rule to make ""ball is win.""
3. Then, since the ball is a win, being next to it would win.

But how to get to the ball. From my position (1 left,5 down):

- Right 2 steps to 0 left,5 down.
- Down 2 steps to 0 left,7 down.
- Then right to 8 right? But walls block this path.

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, then right to 4 steps (wall), can't go further. This is frustrating.

Maybe the key is to realize that ""baba is you"" and ""baba is win"" would make touching the win condition work. So if I can create the rule ""baba is win,"" then standing on the win would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. That's a significant distance. Maybe I can't reach there directly.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""win is you,"" but I'm already you, so that wouldn't change anything.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. So if I can make ""win is you,"" then touching the win would work. But how to get the ""is"" rule there.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is simpler: since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can move to the ""win"" rule and push it. But the ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, and there's a wall at 4 right. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the path clear.

Alternatively, use the ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop wouldn't block. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and write ""stop is nothing.""

But again, how to reach the stop's location. It's at 3 right and 1 down.

From my position (1 left,5 down):

- Move right to 4 steps (hit the wall), can't go further.
- Move down to 5 steps down (position: 1 left,6 down).
- Then right to 3 steps right (avoiding the wall at 4 right), then down to 1 step down. Now at 3 right,1 down, which is the ""stop"" rule's position.
- Pick up the ""is"" rule from somewhere and move it here to make ""stop is nothing.""

But where is the ""is"" rule I can use? The ""is"" at 1 step up or the one at 5 steps down.

If I move up to the ""is"" at 1 step up, then move right to 4 steps (wall), can't. Alternatively, move down to the ""is"" at 5 steps down (position: 1 left,4 down). Then move right and up to reach the ""stop"" at 3 right,1 down.

From 1 left,4 down:

- Move right to 3 steps right (avoiding the wall at 4 right).
- Move up to 1 step up: position 3 right,3 down.
- Then move down to 1 step down: position 3 right,4 down. Hmm, not reaching the ""stop"" at 3 right,1 down.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's look for the closest ""is"" rule and use that.

The ""is"" at 1 step up is closest. Let's move there:

1. Action: up (to reach the ""is"" at 1 step up).
2. Now, with the ""is"" rule, move it to the ""win"" location (9 right,1 up). But path is blocked by walls.
3. Alternatively, move the ""is"" to the ""ball"" and make ""ball is win.""
4. Then push the ball to where I am.

To push the ball, I need to be next to it. The ball is at 8 right,3 down. From my current position after moving up (1 left,4 down):

- Move right to 8 steps right (blocked by wall at 4 right).
- Can't reach the ball directly.

Alternative plan: Use the ""is"" rule at 5 steps down. Move there:

From initial position (1 left,5 down):

- Move down to 5 steps down (position: 1 left,6 down). But there's a wall at 4 right and 5 steps down. Not helpful.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" and create a rule that makes the win condition work. Since I can't reach the win directly, perhaps I need to use existing objects.

Wait, there's a ""door"" at 8 right,2 down. If I make ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win. To do that:

1. Move to the door's location (8 right,2 down).
2. Use the ""is"" rule to write ""door is win.""

But how to get there. From my position (1 left,5 down):

- Move right to 4 steps (wall), can't.
- Maybe move up to avoid the wall.

Alternatively, find a way to push past the wall by changing its property. If I can make ""wall is nothing,"" then I can walk through it. To do that, need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and write ""wall is nothing.""

The ""wall"" is at 2 left,1 up and 4 right,1 up, etc. Let's target the wall at 4 right,1 up.

From my position (1 left,5 down):

- Move up to 1 step up (1 left,4 down).
- Move right to 4 steps right (wall at 4 right,1 up is actually at 4 right,1 up from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position.

This is getting too confusing without a visual map. Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, I'll try to make a move that logically makes sense","

29,left,"<reasoning>
The rules are still ""baba is you"", so I can move Baba around. Looking at the map, there's a ""win"" object 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a series of walls to the right, starting from 2 steps right at 1 step up. So moving directly right isn't possible. There's a ""stop"" block at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which might block the path.

Wait, maybe I can use the text blocks to change the rules. The rule ""is"" is at 1 step up, ball 1 right and 1 up, wall at 4 right and 1 up. There's another ""is"" at 8 steps right and 1 up. Also, the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. Maybe if I can move the ""win"" rule closer or make Baba ""win"". 

Looking down, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 left and 5 down, and another ""is"" at 5 down, and ""you"" at 1 right 5 down. If I can make ""baba is win"", that would make me win. To do that, I need to grab the ""win"" text block and maybe attach it to Baba's rule. 

But how do I move the text blocks? The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up. If I move Baba to the left to reach the ""is"" block, but there's a wall at 1 left 1 up. Wait, the wall is at 1 left 1 up. If I move left from my current position, which seems to be at the original Baba's position (since the active rule is ""baba is you"" without a specific location), maybe I need to navigate to the ""is"" blocks. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" at 8 right and 1 up could be used. Maybe move towards that ""is"" to combine with the ""win"" block. But the path is blocked by walls and a ""stop"" at 3 right 2 down. 

Wait, perhaps I can push the ""win"" block. Since ""baba is you"", I can move towards the ""win"" at 9 right 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right 1 up. Unless there's a way to make the wall movable. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left 1 up. If I can change the ""wall"" property, but I need to manipulate the text blocks. 

Another thought: the ""door"" is at 8 right 2 down. Maybe that's a way through, but it's a door, which might require being ""key"" or something. Not sure. 

Looking back, the ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps down could be used. If I can get to that ""is"" block and combine it with the ""win"" block, maybe rewrite the rule. But how to get there. 

Wait, the current position of Baba isn't explicitly stated, but the rules and objects are positioned relative to something. Assuming I'm at the original position, maybe I need to move up to reach the ""is"" at 1 step up. Let's say I move up once. Then, from there, maybe move left to reach the ""is"" block. But there's a wall at 1 left 1 up. Unless I can push the wall. Since walls are usually immovable unless ""push"" is a rule, which it isn't here. 

Alternatively, maybe move to the ""is"" at 8 right 1 up. To get there from the current position (assuming starting at 0,0), moving right 8 steps, but there are walls at 4 steps right. So that's blocked. 

Hmm, maybe I need to use the ""ball"" somewhere. The ball is at 1 right 2 up. If I can push the ball, but since I'm Baba, and there's no ""push"" rule, maybe not. 

Wait, the ""rule `ball`"" is at 8 right 2 down. Maybe that's a text block indicating that ball is something. If I can move that block to create a new rule. For example, make ""baba is ball"" and then move the ball to the win spot. But not sure. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""you"", maybe I can just walk into the ""win"" if the rule allows. But the ""win"" is a separate object unless the rule is ""baba is win"". 

So the key seems to be to manipulate the text blocks to make ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to access the ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule. 

Looking at the objects, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step up and 8 steps right 1 up. The ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up. If I can move the ""win"" block next to an ""is"" block, then combine them into ""baba is win"". 

But how to move the blocks. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move objects that aren't ""stop"" or similar. The ""stop"" is at 3 right 2 down. So any object not marked stop can be moved. The ""win"" block isn't stop, so I can try to move it. 

If I move right towards the ""win"" block at 9 right 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 right 1 up. Unless I can move the wall. The wall's rule is at 1 left 1 up. If I can change the wall's rule to not be a wall, but that requires manipulating text blocks. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block from 8 right 1 up to be next to the ""win"" block. Then combine them. 

But to move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Let's see. The ""is"" is at 8 right 1 up. My current position is maybe at the original spot, which based on other rules, perhaps at the lower part. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 left 5 down. So maybe I'm near there. 

If I move up to reach the ""is"" at 1 step up, then left or right. But the path might be blocked. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Locate the ""is"" text block that can be used to create a new rule.
2. Move the ""win"" text block next to this ""is"" block.
3. Combine them to form ""baba is win"".

To do this, I need to navigate to the ""win"" block at 9 right 1 up, move it left past the walls. But the wall at 4 right 1 up is blocking. Maybe if I can move that wall by changing its rule. The wall's rule is at 1 left 1 up: ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". So if I can move that ""wall"" rule, then the wall object might become movable. 

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is a text block that defines that the object at 2 left 1 up is a wall. If I can move that text block, then the wall's property would change. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to say ""baba is wall"", then I would be a wall, which might be immovable. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" rule to another position, so the wall object no longer has the ""wall"" property. But that requires precise movement. 

This is quite challenging. Maybe a simpler approach: Since I'm Baba and ""you"", perhaps I can move to the ""win"" object if it's reachable. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Wait, looking at the objects again, there's a ""door"" at 8 right 2 down. Maybe if I can push the door out of the way, but I don't know the rules for doors. 

Alternatively, use the ""ball"" to break through? Not sure. 

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 right 5 down. If I can make Baba ""you"" by default, which it already is. So that's not helpful. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so I am you. So maybe I just need to reach the ""win"" object. But how? 

If I can move the ""stop"" block at 3 right 2 down, but it's a stop, so I can't move it. 

Alternatively, find a way to remove the stop property. 

This is really tricky. Let's try to think step by step. 

Current position: Assuming I'm at the original Baba location, which based on the ""rule `baba`"" at 1 left 5 down, maybe I'm somewhere below. 

If I move up, I can reach the ""is"" at 1 step up. From there, maybe move left or right. 

Alternatively, move right towards the ""is"" at 8 right 1 up. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Wait, the wall at 4 right 1 up is there. If I can move that wall by changing its rule. The rule for that wall is at 1 left 1 up: ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". So if I can move that ""wall"" rule, perhaps the wall at 4 right 1 up will no longer be a wall. 

To move the ""wall"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left 1 up. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the original Baba spot, which is maybe 1 left 5 down), moving up to 1 left 4 down, then left to 1 left 5 down? Not sure. This is getting confusing without a visual map. 

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move the ""win"" block next to an ""is"" block. The ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up. The ""is"" blocks are at 1 step up and 8 right 1 up. If I can move the ""win"" block left to 8 right 1 up, adjacent to the ""is"" there, then the rule becomes ""baba is win"". 

To move the ""win"" block, I need to be next to it and move it. The ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up. To get there, I need to move right 9 steps, but there are walls at 4 right 1 up. Unless I can move the walls. 

This seems impossible. Maybe there's another way. 

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps down can be used. If I can get to that ""is"" and combine it with the ""win"" rule. 

But how to reach there. The ""rule `is`"" is at 5 down. From the current position (assuming starting near the bottom), moving down might not be possible. 

Alternatively, use the ""door"" at 8 right 2 down. If I can move through the door, but doors are usually passable unless there's a ""stop"" rule. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try moving towards the ""win"" block and see if I can find a path. Alternatively, try to push the walls by moving them, but since they're walls, they might be stoppers. 

Wait, the ""stop"" block is at 3 right 2 down. If I can move that, but it's a stop, so I can't. 

Another idea: Since ""baba is you"", maybe I can write a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" block next to an ""is"" block. The ""is"" block at 8 right 1 up is close to the ""win"" at 9 right 1 up. If I can move the ""win"" block one step left to be adjacent to the ""is"" at 8 right 1 up, then the rule becomes ""baba is win"", making me win. 

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block left once. Since I'm Baba, I can move objects that aren't stop. The ""win"" isn't stop, so I can try to move it. 

So the plan is:

1. Move to the position of the ""win"" block at 9 right 1 up.
2. Move left once to place it at 8 right 1 up, next to the ""is"" block.
3. This creates the rule ""baba is win"", allowing me to touch the win object.

But how to navigate there. Let's see. The current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm near the bottom. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 left 5 down. To get to the ""win"" at 9 right 1 up, I need to move up 4 steps and right 10 steps, but there are walls in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a path using the ""door"" or other objects. The door is at 8 right 2 down. If I can move down to that area, maybe through the door. 

But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, perhaps the best action now is to try moving towards the ""win"" block, even if it's blocked, hoping that the model can find a valid path. Alternatively, try to interact with the ""is"" blocks to create the desired rule. 

Maybe the correct action is to move right towards the ""is"" at 8 right 1 up, hoping to push past the walls by rearranging the text blocks. 

But given the previous failures, I think the intended solution is to move the ""win"" block next to an ""is"" block. So the action would be to move left from the ""win"" block's position to place it adjacent to the ""is"". 

Assuming the current position is near the ""win"" block, the action would be left. But earlier attempts to left or right resulted in failures. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to move up to reach the higher ""is"" block and combine it with the ""win"". 

Given the confusion and the need to provide an action, I'll go with moving left towards the ""win"" block to position it next to the ""is"".

Let's see. The goal is to get to the WIN object, which is usually at the far right. The active rule is ""baba is you"", so I'm basically controlling Baba. The problem is there are walls (STOP) blocking the path. Right now, I need to figure out how to move past them.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""is"" block that might be useful. If I can move that ""is"" block to form a new rule, maybe I can change something. The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, and there's a ""baba is you"" rule already. Wait, maybe I can make Baba into a different property.

The WIN is at 9 steps right, but there's a wall blocking the direct path. The door at 8 steps right and 2 steps down might be a way through, but there's a ""stop"" wall next to it. Hmm. Maybe I need to turn the door into a passable object. How?

If I can create a ""door is win"" rule, then stepping on the door would make it a win. But first, I need to move the ""is"" blocks. The ""is"" is at 1 step up. If I move it to nearby objects, like combining with ""door"" and ""win"", but where am I right now? Let's check the player's position. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So I'm probably at that location. To reach the ""is"" block at 1 step up, I can move up. But moving up would get me to the ""is"" block. Once there, I can pick it up and move it to combine with ""door"" and ""win"".

Wait, the ""is"" block is 1 step up from me. If I move up, I can grab it. Then, move it to the door's position (8 steps right, 2 steps down) and the win's position (9 steps right, 1 step up). So creating a rule like ""door is win"" would make the door the win condition. Then I can go through the door.

But how to do that step by step. First, move up to grab the ""is"" block. Then move right to the door's location, place the ""is"" there, then maybe move to the win's location and create ""door is win"". Alternatively, after placing the ""is"" next to door and win, combine them. But I have to make sure I can move the blocks without hitting STOP walls.

Looking at the path: from my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving up to the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Then right to reach the door area. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, which is a STOP. So need to navigate around that. Maybe move up, take the ""is"" block, then move right past the walls. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe there's a way around by moving up or down.

Alternatively, use the existing ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right, 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block down to combine with door and win. But how? I need to move that block. But to move it, I have to be adjacent and not hit a STOP. The block at 8 steps right, 1 step up is a rule `is`. To get there, I'd have to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So maybe that's not the way.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't STOP. The ""is"" blocks are movable unless they're part of a STOP rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right, 2 steps down. So anything not STOP can be moved. So if I move the ""is"" block from 1 step up to next to the door (8 steps right, 2 steps down), then place another ""is"" next to ""win"", creating ""door is win"". Then stepping on the door would make it a WIN.

But how to get there. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move up from current position (1 left, 5 down) to the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
2. Take that ""is"" block and move right towards the door's location (8 right, 2 down).
3. Navigate around the walls. After moving up, I'm at 1 step up. From there, move right until I reach the door area. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up. So maybe move down to avoid it? Or find another path.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""is"" block, move right, then down to reach the door's area. Let's see:

- Starting at 1 left, 5 down.
- Move up to 1 left, 4 down (but the ""is"" is at 1 step up, which would be 1 left, 4 down? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

Assuming the player's position is where the ""rule `baba`"" is located: 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. So coordinates might be (left/right, up/down). So moving up from there would decrease the down steps. For example, current position is (left:1, down:4). Moving up once would be (left:1, down:3), then again (down:2), etc.

The ""is"" block is 1 step up, so that's (left:1, down:3). So moving up once gets there. Then take that ""is"" block.

From there, to get to the door at (right:8, down:2). So need to move right 9 times (since current x is left:1, need to get to right:8, which is 9 steps to the right). But there are walls at right:4 in various positions. So moving right from left:1, down:3, you hit walls at right:4, which are STOP. So you can't pass through them. So this path is blocked.

Alternative route: After picking up the ""is"" block, move down to avoid the walls. From the ""is"" block at (left:1, down:3), move down to (left:1, down:4), which is the player's original position. Then move right, but again hitting walls at right:4. Hmm.

Maybe another ""is"" block is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. That's the rule `is` at (right:8, up:1). If I can move that one. To get there, I need to move right 9 times from the player's position (left:1, down:4), but again walls at right:4. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to create a ""door is you"" rule, making the door controllable. Then push the door to the WIN. But how?

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", maybe push the ball (which is 1 step right and 2 step up) to somewhere. But the ball is probably not helpful unless it's part of a rule.

Another thought: The ""win"" is at 9 steps right, 1 step up. If I can make that a Baba, but I'm already Baba. Or make ""win is you"", but I need to create that rule.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you"". If I can create ""win is you"", then stepping on win would make me win. But how to do that. Need to move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you"".

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. So if I can move an ""is"" block next to ""win"" (9 right, 1 up) and ""you"" (1 right,5 down), then create ""win is you"". But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 1 step up. Move it to the ""win"" location, then place another ""is"" next to ""you"" to make ""win is you"".

But movement is the issue. Let's break it down:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
2. Move right, avoiding walls. Since moving right from (1 left,4 down) to (0 left,4 down), then right to (right:1, down:4). Continuing right, but at right:4, there's a wall. So need to find a way around. Maybe move up or down when hitting the wall.

For example:

- After moving up to get the ""is"" block, position is (1 left,3 down).
- Move right to (0 left,3 down), (right:1,3 down), ..., until right:4 is a wall (STOP). So can't go further right. So need to move up or down.

If I move up to (1 left,2 down), then right past the wall at right:4,1 up. Wait, the wall at right:4 is in various positions. Let me check the map again.

The walls are at:

- 2 step to the left and 1 step up (so left:2, up:1)
- 3 steps to the right and 1 step up (right:3, up:1)
- 3 steps to the right (right:3)
- 2 steps to the right and 1 step down (right:2, down:1)
- etc.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to push the ""stop"" wall to remove it. But ""stop"" objects can't be moved unless they're not part of a rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So the wall at that position is a STOP, meaning it can't be moved. So I can't push it.

Alternative plan: Create a ""stop is push"" rule, but that would require having the ""is"" block next to ""stop"" and ""push"". Not sure if that's possible.

Wait, another idea: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push other objects. For example, the ball at 1 step right and 2 step up. If I push it towards the WIN, but the WIN is blocked by a wall. But if I can move the wall, maybe by changing its rule.

The wall at 4 steps right is defined by ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". So that wall's existence is based on that rule. If I can remove that rule or change it, the wall would disappear.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block that's part of that rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 step left and 1 step up. So there's an ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""rule"". Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you"", and other rules like ""wall is ..."". The specific rule for the wall at right:4, up:1 is ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"". So that rule is located at 2 left,1 up. To modify that, I need to move the ""is"" block that's part of it.

But this is getting too complex. Maybe the simplest way is to create a ""door is win"" rule. Here's how:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
2. Move right towards the door at 8 steps right, 2 steps down.
3. Place the ""is"" block next to ""door"" to form ""door is ..."".
4. Then move another ""is"" block next to ""win"" to complete ""door is win"".

But how to navigate there. Let's try step-by-step:

- Start at (1 left,5 down).
- Move up once to (1 left,4 down) – but the ""is"" is at 1 step up, so maybe (1 left,3 down)? Need to clarify the coordinate system.

Assuming that ""1 step up"" from the player's position (rule `baba` at 1 left,4 down) would be (1 left,3 down).
- Move up to (1 left,3 down) – now on the ""is"" block.
- Take the ""is"" block.
- Move right: from (1 left,3 down) to (0 left,3 down), (right:1,3 down), ..., until reaching the door's location at (right:8, down:2).

But the path is blocked by walls at right:4. So after moving right to right:4, which is a STOP wall, can't proceed. Hence, need to find another route.

Alternative route: After picking up the ""is"" block, move down to avoid the wall. From (1 left,3 down), move down to (1 left,4 down) – back to starting position. Then move right, but again hit the wall at right:4. Maybe move up again, then right around the wall.

This is tricky. Perhaps another ""is"" block can be used. The one at 8 steps right,1 step up. If I can move that, but it's located at (right:8, up:1). To get there, need to move right 9 times, passing through walls. Not possible.

Wait, maybe the solution is to use the existing ""you"" rule. Since ""baba is you"" and ""you"" is at 1 step right,5 down. If I can make ""you"" into ""win"", then I win by being you. But how?

Create ""you is win"" rule. To do that, need to move ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win"".

The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. ""You"" is at 1 right,5 down. So placing ""is"" between them would create ""you is win"".

But how to get there. Let's see:

- From current position (1 left,5 down), move right to 1 right,5 down (the ""you"" rule).
- Then move up to the ""is"" block at 1 step up (1 left,3 down). No, that's not adjacent.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best move is to move the ""is"" block to combine with ""door"" and ""win"" to make ""door is win"". Let's try:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move right, avoiding walls by going around them.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""door"" and another ""is"" next to ""win"" to form the rule.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" block at 8 steps right,1 step up is already present, maybe use that. If I can move it down to the door's area.

But how to move that ""is"" block. It's at (right:8, up:1). To move it down, I need to be adjacent and push it. But the path is blocked by walls at right:4. So unless I can move around those walls, it's impossible.

Perhaps the solution is to push the ball to create a path. The ball is at 1 right,2 up. If I push it right, maybe it moves into a position that allows accessing the ""is"" blocks further right.

But the ball is a separate object. Since I'm Baba, I can push objects that aren't STOP. The ball isn't STOP, so I can push it. Let's try:

- Move right to push the ball. From current position (1 left,5 down), move right to 1 right,5 down (the ""you"" rule). Then move up to push the ball up. But the ball is at 1 right,2 up. To push it, need to be adjacent.

Alternatively, move to the ball's location and push it. But the ball is at 1 right,2 up. The player is at 1 left,5 down. So need to move right and down to reach the ball.

This seems too time-consuming and possibly not the intended path.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action is to move up to the ""is"" block, grab it, and then move right towards the door area, placing the ""is"" to create the necessary rule. Even if blocked by walls, perhaps there's a way around.

Alternatively, since the ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, and there's a door at 8 right,2 down, maybe pushing the door to the WIN location. But to do that, the door needs to be a pushable object, which it is unless STOP. The door's rule is ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 1 step down"", so it's a regular door, can be pushed.

So steps:

1. Move up to get the ""is"" block.
2. Move to the door's location and create ""door is win"".
3. Push the door to the WIN location.

But how to create ""door is win"". Need to place ""is"" next to both ""door"" and ""win"".

The door is at 8 right,1 down. The win is at 9 right,1 up. So if I can move the ""is"" block to be next to door and win, then the rule is formed.

Perhaps:

- From the ""is"" block at 1 step up, move right to 8 right,1 down (door's location), place the ""is"" there.
- Then move to the win's location (9 right,1 up) and place another ""is"".
- This creates ""door is win"".

But movement is tricky. Let's outline:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move right 7 times to reach the door's x-coordinate (8 right), but need to adjust for y-coordinate. The door is at 1 step down from the current y after moving up. This is getting too vague without a clear coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is simply to move right repeatedly towards the WIN, hoping to find a path, but given the walls, that's unlikely.

After considering all options, the safest valid action that progresses towards the goal is to move up to interact with the ""is"" block and then use it to create the necessary rule. So the chosen action is to move up.

31,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with objects. My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I know I can change rules to alter that.

Looking at the map, there's a ""win"" rule positioned 9 steps to the right on the same horizontal level as the other ""win"" rules. However, there's a series of walls and a ""stop"" block between me and that area. The walls are at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and then continue down. The ""stop"" block is 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down, which probably means I can't pass through it unless I change its property.

I see a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to bypass the walls or the stop block. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"" or ""stop is nothing,"" that might help. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the target word.

Currently, my position isn't clear from the observation, but assuming I'm near the ""baba"" rule at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down, I might need to move upwards. The last action was ""up,"" and the observation shows that the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up. Maybe I should move towards that ""is"" block to manipulate the rules.

Alternatively, if I can turn the ""stop"" block into something passable, like ""stop is push"" or ""stop is you,"" but since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe making ""you is stop"" would make me stop, which isn't good. Hmm.

Another angle: the ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it the win condition. But how to do that? I need to move the ""is"" block to the ball and change the rule. But the ball is blocked by walls and a door. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can open the door, maybe by changing its rule, but I don't see a ""key"" or anything.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is there, but I can push it if it's not stopped. The ""stop"" block is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move past the stop block, maybe by making ""stop is nothing,"" but I need to edit the rules.

Let me recap the objects. The key ones are:

- ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up: this is crucial for creating new rules.
- ""win"" at 9 steps right.
- ""stop"" at 3 right, 2 down.
- ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down.
- ""ball"" at 8 right, 3 down.

My plan: move the ""is"" block to adjacent objects to rewrite their rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and making ""stop is push"" so I can move past it. Or moving ""is"" to ""win"" and changing it to something else, but I need to reach the win first.

Alternatively, make ""wall is push"" so I can move them out of the way. But the walls are solid unless they're pushed. Wait, ""wall is stop"" would make them immovable. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push,"" then I can move the walls.

But to do that, I need to find the existing ""wall"" rule. The observation shows ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up."" So there's a rule that says ""wall is..."" somewhere. If I can move that rule and the ""is"" block together to rewrite it.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is win"" so that touching me would make me the win condition. But I'm already ""you,"" so if I make ""baba is win,"" then since I'm Baba and ""you,"" does that make me win? Maybe.

But how to implement this. Let's see. The existing rules are ""baba is you"" and the others are rules about properties. To make ""baba is win,"" I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and then change ""you"" to ""win.""

Looking at the map, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I can move down to that ""baba"" rule and then move the ""is"" block next to it, I can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win."" But I need to navigate there.

Current position: Not explicitly stated, but based on previous actions, maybe near the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down. To get to the ""baba"" rule at 4 steps down, I need to move up once. Then move left to reach the ""baba"" rule. Then move the ""is"" block from 1 step up to be next to ""baba.""

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" block to the ""you"" rule at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down, changing ""you"" to ""win."" That would make me win immediately since I'm ""you."" That seems possible.

So steps:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
2. Move left or right to position the ""is"" next to the ""you"" rule.
3. Swap their positions to make ""baba is win"" or ""you is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can move unless blocked by ""stop."" The path to the ""you"" rule at 5 steps down, 1 step right might be clear. Let's check the obstacles.

From the current position (assuming near the bottom left), moving up to reach the ""is"" at 1 step up. Then moving right to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down. But the way down might have walls. The wall at 4 steps right and various positions. Maybe need to navigate around.

Alternatively, if I can push the ""is"" block. Since ""is"" is a text block, and if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. The ""is"" blocks are movable unless there's a ""stop"" rule on them. Looking at the active rules, there's no ""is is stop,"" so they should be movable.

So, perhaps:

- Move up to get to the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
- Then move left to the ""baba"" rule at 4 steps down, 1 step left.
- Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and change the rule to ""baba is win.""

Alternatively, move the ""is"" to the ""you"" rule to make ""you is win,"" making me win immediately.

But how to do that step by step. Let me think.

Current Observation:

Active rules: baba is you.

Objects:

- rule `is` 1 step up
- ball 1 step right, 1 step up
- walls at 4 right, 1 up; 4 right; 4 right, 1 down; etc.
- rule `is` at 8 right, 1 up (another is block)
- rule `win` at 9 right, 1 up
- rule `wall` at 1 left, 1 up
- stop at 3 right, 2 down
- door at 8 right, 2 down
- ball at 8 right, 3 down
- rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down
- rule `is` at 1 left, 4 down
- rule `you` at 1 right, 5 down
- walls at 4 right, 5 down

Assuming I'm positioned at the ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 5 down. To reach the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 5 down, I need to move right. But is there a wall in the way?

Looking at the map, at 4 steps right, there are walls at various positions. From 5 steps down, the wall is at 4 right, 5 down. So if I move right from my position (1 left, 5 down), moving right towards the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 5 down, I would pass through x=0,1,2,3,4. But at x=4, there's a wall. So I can't move directly right past x=3 to x=4 because of the wall at 4 right, 5 down.

Therefore, I need another path. Maybe move up to the ""is"" block at 1 step up, then move left or right to reach the ""you"" rule.

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" at 1 step up, then right to the ball area, but that's blocked by walls and the door.

Another approach: Use the existing ""is"" block at 1 step up to create a new rule. For example, move it to the ""stop"" block and make ""stop is push"" so I can move through it. But how?

If I can get the ""is"" next to the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. So I need to move the ""is"" block down to 2 steps down, 3 right. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. Changing ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push."" That way, walls can be moved out of the way.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. So if I move left from the ""is"" block's position (1 step up), I can reach the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. Then swap them to make ""wall is [new property].""

For example, if I move the ""is"" left to be next to ""wall,"" then the rule becomes ""wall is [property next to it]."" If the current rule is ""wall is stop,"" changing it to ""wall is push"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and then next to ""push.""

Wait, but the properties are fixed? Or can I create new ones by placing ""is"" next to any word?

In Baba Is You, you can create new rules by placing a subject next to ""is"" and then next to a property. So, for example, if you have ""wall"" next to ""is"" next to ""push,"" then the new rule is ""wall is push.""

So, the existing ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I move the ""is"" block left to be next to the ""wall"" rule, then the rule becomes ""wall is [whatever is next to the other side of 'is'].""

Looking at the objects, at 1 left, 1 up, there's the ""wall"" rule and the ""is"" block. If I move the ""is"" block to the left of ""wall,"" then the rule would be ""wall is [left of 'is']."" But there's nothing to the left of ""wall"" except empty space. That might not work.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the right of the ""wall"" rule. So the ""wall"" is on the left, ""is"" is in the middle, and then the property on the right. If I can place a property there, like ""push,"" but I don't see a ""push"" block. The available objects are ball, door, stop, win, wall.

Wait, the properties are things like YOU, WIN, STOP, PUSH, etc. The existing rules use these. So maybe I need to create a ""push"" property by combining existing blocks. But there's no ""push"" text block on the map.

Hmm, this complicates things. Maybe I should focus on changing the ""you"" rule to ""win."" Since I'm ""you,"" if I make ""you is win,"" then touching me would make me win. But how to do that.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. So I need to move the ""is"" block to that area. Let's see the path.

From the ""is"" at 1 step up, I need to move down to 5 steps down. That's four steps down. But the way down might be blocked by walls. Looking at the map, at 4 steps right, there are walls at various positions, but not directly in the vertical path from 1 step up to 5 steps down. For example, moving down from 1 step up:

- Step 1: 2 step up
- Step 2: 3 step up
- Step 3: 4 step up
- Step 4: 5 step up (but the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, which is the opposite direction). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system.

The observations mention positions like ""1 step to the left and 2 step up."" So each object's position is relative to the player's position? Or is there a fixed grid?

This is a bit confusing. Assuming that the player can move in directions (up, down, left, right) relative to their current position, and the objects have absolute positions on the grid.

Assuming the player is at a certain coordinate, and the objects are located at other coordinates. To move the ""is"" block to the ""you"" rule, the player would need to navigate to that area.

But without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to plan. However, based on previous actions, the last action was ""left,"" which might have moved the player left, and the observation shows that the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So perhaps the player is near there.

If the player is at ""baba"" rule's position (1 left, 5 down), to reach the ""you"" rule at (1 right, 5 down), they need to move right twice, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, 5 down. So moving right from x=1 to x=4 would be blocked by the wall at x=4.

Alternative path: Move up to avoid the wall. From (1 left, 5 down), move up to (1 left, 4 down), then right to (2 left, 4 down), etc., until reaching the ""you"" rule. But need to check for walls.

Looking at the map:

At 4 steps right, 5 down: wall.

At 4 steps right, 4 down: wall.

So moving right from (1 left, 5 down) to (2 left, 5 down) is possible, then to (3 left, 5 down), then (4 left, 5 down) is blocked. So can't go straight right.

Alternative route: Move up to 1 left, 4 down. Then right to 2 left, 4 down. Check if there's a wall. At 4 steps right, 4 down: wall. So x=4 is blocked. Continue to x=3, which should be clear. Then move down to 5 down.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on creating a new rule that allows passage.

For example, create ""stop is push"" so that the stop block can be moved out of the way. To do this, need to find the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, no: the ""stop"" object is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, but the rule `stop` is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, the observation says:

""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 1 step down""

So the rule ""stop"" is at (2 right, 1 down), which defines that ""stop"" has the STOP property. To change this, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""stop"" and then change its property.

If I can move the ""is"" block from its current position (1 step up) to be next to the ""stop"" rule at (2 right, 1 down), then I can change the rule. For example, making ""stop is push.""

But how to get there. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. To reach (2 right, 1 down), the player would need to move down and right.

Assuming the player is at (1 left, 5 down), moving up to (1 left, 4 down), then right to (2 left, 4 down), (3 left, 4 down), (4 left, 4 down) [but there's a wall at 4 right, 4 down], so can't go there. Maybe move to (3 left, 4 down), then down to (3 left, 5 down), but that's where the wall is. Hmm.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the simplest solution is to create a new rule that makes ""baba"" the win condition. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching me would win the game.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at (1 left, 5 down). The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. So the player needs to move down to (1 left, 5 down), which is the position of the ""baba"" rule. Then move the ""is"" block next to it.

But how to get there. If the player is currently at (1 left, 5 down) (assuming they were there after previous moves), then moving the ""is"" block from 1 step up (which would be (1 left, 4 down)) to be next to the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, this is confusing without a clear coordinate system. Let's assume that the player's position is the same as the ""baba"" rule, which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up from there, so (1 left, 4 down).

To move the ""is"" block to the ""baba"" rule at (1 left, 5 down), the player would need to move down once. Then","

Let's try to figure out the right move here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around like Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right on the same level as the other rules. But wait, the ""win"" object itself is at 9 steps right, 1 step up. However, there's a ""stop"" property at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Also, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. But how do these interact?

The walls are pretty dense on the right side. The rightmost walls start at 4 steps right and go down to 5 steps down. The ""win"" is just beyond those walls, but maybe I need to move around them. 

The rule `is` is at 1 step up, and there's another `is` at 8 steps right, 1 step up. The `you` rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down, connected to the `baba` rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So, combining those, maybe I can manipulate the rules to change what I am or what's required to win.

The ball is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be associated with the ball, then I could just reach the ball instead. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to the ball's location. But the ""win"" rule is currently at 9 steps right, 1 step up, which is a wall. Wait, the rule `win` is separate from the wall at 1 step left. The wall at 4 steps right is just a regular wall.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, 1 step up. That's a separate object. To move it, I need to pick it up and drag it to the ball. But can I move the ""win"" rule? The only rules affecting movement are ""baba is you,"" which means I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""win"" rule itself isn't stopped unless there's a ""stop"" property on it. Looking at the map, there's a ""stop"" at 3 steps right, 2 steps down, but that's not near the ""win"" rule. So, I should be able to pick up the ""win"" rule and move it.

So the plan could be: move towards the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right, 1 step up, pick it up, and carry it to the ball at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. Then, placing the ""win"" there would make the ball the win condition. Once that's done, moving to the ball would win the level.

But how to get to the ""win"" rule? Let's see my current position. The `baba` rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So I'm at that position. The ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up from there. Let's calculate the path:

From 1 left, 5 down:
- To reach 1 step up: move up once. Then, from there, I need to move right 8 steps and down 4 steps? Wait, the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, no, the ""win"" rule's position is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up from where? Maybe relative to the current position. Wait, the observation says the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. So from my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving right 8 steps would get me to 0 left (assuming steps are absolute?), but maybe the positions are relative. This is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the positions properly.

Each object's position is described relative to the player's current position. For example, ""ball 2 step up"" means the ball is two steps up from where I am. So, if I'm at (0,0), the ball is at (0,2). The ""win"" rule is at (9,1), meaning 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. The wall at 4 steps right is at (4,0). The ""stop"" is at (3, -1) (since 1 step down from (3,0)). 

So my current position is (0,0) (since the Baba rule is there). The ""win"" is at (9,1). The path to get there is blocked by walls at (4,0), (4,1), etc. So moving right directly isn't possible. Instead, I need to find a way around the walls. Maybe moving up first, then right, then down.

But first, I need to reach the ""win"" rule to move it. Let's see the steps:

1. From (0,0), move up to (0,1). There's a ball at (0,2), but moving up once gets me to (0,1), which is clear. Then move right to (1,1), (2,1), ..., but there's a wall at (4,1). So I can't go straight right. 

Alternatively, move up to (0,1), then right to (3,1), but there's a ""stop"" at (3, -1), which is below. Wait, the ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 1 step down from where? If I'm at (0,0), then ""stop 3 steps to the right and 1 step down"" is at (3, -1). That's a wall that's stoppable, meaning I can't push through it.

So perhaps I need to find another path. Maybe move up to (0,1), then left to (1,1) but that's the ball's position. Wait, the ball is at (0,2) relative to the initial position. Wait, no: the ball is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from the current Baba position. So if Baba is at (0,0), the ball is at (1,2). The wall at 4 steps right is at (4,0). The ""win"" is at (9,1).

So to get to the ""win"" at (9,1), I need to navigate around the walls. Let's see:

From (0,0):

- Move up to (0,1). Then right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). At (3,1), there's a ""stop"" at (3, -1), but that's below. Not sure if that affects movement. Then at (4,1), there's a wall. So can't go right past (3,1). 

Alternatively, from (0,1), move right to (3,1), then up to (3,2). But there's a wall at (4,1) and (4,0), so maybe moving up from (3,1) to (3,2) is possible. Then from (3,2), move right to (4,2), but there's a wall at (4,2)? Let me check the objects:

The wall at 4 steps right is at (4,0). Then wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down is at (4, -1). Wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down is (4, -2). So above (4,0), there's nothing except maybe the ""door"" at (8, 2) and ""ball"" at (8,3). 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down from where? If the current Baba is at (0,0), then the ""door"" is at (8, -2). Similarly, the ""ball"" is at (8, -3). The ""win"" is at (9,1). 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""win"" rule by moving up first. From (0,0), move up to (0,1). Then move right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). At (3,1), there's a ""stop"" at (3, -1), but that's below. Maybe I can move past (3,1) by moving right to (4,1), but there's a wall there. So that's blocked.

Alternative route: Move up to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), but there's a wall at 1 step to the left (which would be (-1,0) perhaps?). Not sure. 

Alternatively, move up twice to (0,2), where the ball is. But the ball is just a ball; not sure if it's useful yet. Then from (0,2), move right. But the wall at (4,0) is below, but maybe above there's a path. From (0,2), moving right to (1,2), (2,2), etc. At (4,2), is there a wall? The wall is at (4,0), (4, -1), (4, -2), etc. So above (4,0), there's no wall. So from (0,2), moving right to (4,2) is possible. Then from (4,2), move down to (4,1), but there's a wall there. Hmm.

This is tricky. Maybe instead of focusing on moving the ""win"" rule, I should look for a way to change the win condition. For example, if I can make the ball the win condition by moving the ""win"" rule onto it, then I just need to reach the ball.

To do that, I need to pick up the ""win"" rule at (9,1) and move it to the ball's position at (8, -3). But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can use the ""is"" rules to create new rules.

There are ""is"" rules at (0,1) and (8,1). If I can move the ""is"" rule at (8,1) to combine with another property. For example, if I make ""ball is win"", then the ball becomes the win condition. To do that, I need to take the ""win"" rule and attach it to the ""ball"" using an ""is"" rule.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at (9,1).
2. Pick up the ""win"" rule.
3. Move to the ""ball"" at (8, -3).
4. Place the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball"" and combine them with an ""is"" rule.

But to do this, I need to navigate through the map. Let's outline the path:

Current position: (0,0).

Goal: reach (9,1) to get the ""win"" rule, then move to (8,-3) to place it on the ball.

Path to (9,1):

- From (0,0), move up to (0,1).
- Move right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1).
- At (3,1), can I move right? There's a wall at (4,0), but nothing at (4,1). So yes, move right to (4,1).
- From (4,1), move right to (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1). Along the way, are there walls? The walls are at (4,0), (4,-1), etc., but above (4,0), there are no walls mentioned. So this path should be clear.

Once at (9,1), pick up the ""win"" rule and carry it down to (8,-3).

From (9,1) to (8,-3):

- Move left to (8,1), then down to (8,0), (8,-1), (8,-2), (8,-3). There's a ""door"" at (8,-2) and a ""ball"" at (8,-3). The ""door"" might be movable if it's not stopped, but since it's a door, perhaps it's just a passable object unless there's a ""stop"".

Assuming I can move through the door, placing the ""win"" rule next to the ball would make ""ball is win"". Then moving to the ball would win the level.

But how to get the ""is"" rule involved? There's an ""is"" rule at (0,1) and another at (8,1). If I can use the ""is"" rule at (8,1) to combine with the ""win"" rule and the ""ball"", that might work.

Alternatively, after placing the ""win"" rule next to the ball, the existing ""is"" rule at (8,1) could be used to create ""ball is win"". For example, if there's an ""is"" rule nearby, I can place the ""win"" next to the ball and the ""is"" rule to form ""ball IS win"".

So the plan is:

1. Move to (9,1) and grab the ""win"" rule.
2. Carry it to (8,-3), placing it next to the ball.
3. Use the existing ""is"" rule at (8,1) or bring one from (0,1) to create ""ball IS win"".

But how to do this step by step?

First, navigate to (9,1):

- From (0,0) → up → (0,1)
- right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)
- right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1)

At (9,1), pick up the ""win"" rule (action: take? Or since it's a text block, move it by stepping on it and then moving away? In Baba Is You, you move text blocks by walking over them and then moving in a direction, which attaches the text block to you, and you can carry it.)

So, once at (9,1), move left to (8,1) while carrying the ""win"" rule. Then move down to (8,0), (8,-1), (8,-2), (8,-3). Place the ""win"" rule next to the ball at (8,-3).

Now, the ball is at (8,-3), and the ""win"" rule is next to it. There's an ""is"" rule at (8,1). If I can bring that ""is"" rule down to (8,-3), I can create ""ball IS win"".

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at (8,1) by moving it down. But that might require more steps.

Alternatively, once the ""win"" is next to the ball, the existing ""is"" rule at (8,1) could be moved next to them. Let's see:

After placing ""win"" at (8,-3), move to (8,1) where the ""is"" rule is. Pick it up and carry it down to (8,-3). Then place it between the ball and the ""win"" to form ""ball IS win"".

So the steps would be:

1. Move from (9,1) to (8,1) (left once).
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule at (8,1).
3. Move down to (8,-3), placing the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" and the ball.

This would create the rule ""ball IS win"", making the ball the win condition. Then, moving to the ball at (8,-3) would win the level.

But how to execute this in actions? Each action is a single step. So I need to sequence the moves correctly.

Let's outline the action sequence:

Current position after getting ""win"" rule: (9,1). Carrying the ""win"" rule.

Actions:

1. Move left to (8,1) (carrying ""win"").
2. Take the ""is"" rule at (8,1) (now carrying both ""win"" and ""is"").
3. Move down to (8,0).
4. Move down to (8,-1).
5. Move down to (8,-2).
6. Move down to (8,-3). Now at (8,-3), place both ""is"" and ""win"" next to the ball.

But when placing, you have to ensure they are adjacent. So when moving to (8,-3), drop the ""is"" and ""win"" next to the ball.

Once that's done, the rule ""ball IS win"" is active, so touching the ball wins.

Then, move to the ball (which is now at (8,-3)) by stepping on it.

But this requires careful movement and ensuring that the rules are correctly placed.

Alternatively, if I can't carry two rules at once, maybe I need to place the ""win"" first, then get the ""is"" rule and place it next.

But in Baba Is You, you cancarry multiple text blocks as long as they're attached to you. So yes, you can carry both.

So the action sequence would involve moving the ""win"" rule to the ball's location and then the ""is"" rule to form the new rule.

Given the complexity, the immediate next step is to move towards the ""win"" rule. Since the previous actions were failing, perhaps the assistant wasn't correctly parsing the positions. Let's try to focus on moving up first.

Current position is where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down from the initial position (assuming). Wait, no—the observation says ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down"". So if the initial position is (0,0), then the ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -4). The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up from there, so (-1, -3). The ball is at 2 steps up from the ""baba"" rule, which is (-1, -2). This is getting too confusing without a visual.

Perhaps a better approach is to look for the closest movable object. The ""is"" rule is nearby. If I can move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule, like ""ball is win"", that might work.

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to the ball and the ""win"" rule, but the ""win"" rule is far away. Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule at 9 steps right,1 step up.

Another angle: The ""you"" rule is at","

Let me try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move around and manipulate text blocks. The goal is probably to get to the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. The ""win"" object is currently at 9 steps right, 1 step up, but it's just a ""win"" rule. Since I'm ""baba"" and ""you,"" I need to either reach the ""win"" object or change what ""win"" means. 

But there's a ""stop"" block at 3 steps right, 2 steps down. I can't move through that. The ""door"" is at 8 steps right, 2 steps down. Maybe if I make the door a passable object? To do that, I might need to change the ""stop"" property. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" block at 5 steps down. If I move that to combine with ""you"" or another property, maybe I can redefine ""door"" or ""win."" Let's see. If I take the ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps down and place it next to ""door,"" maybe I can make ""door IS YOU"" or something. But first, I need to move that ""is"" block.

But how do I move it? Since I'm Baba (you), I can push objects that aren't ""stop."" The ""is"" block at 5 steps down is a rule, right? So I can move it. The direction to get to the ""door"" is 8 steps right, 2 steps down. From my current position, which seems to be moving around based on previous actions, maybe I need to go left or up to reach that ""is"" block.

Wait, the latest observation shows the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, and the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down. The Baba with the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So I'm there. If I can pick up that ""is"" block and move it to the ""door"" or ""win"" to change their properties.

But how to get there. Let's see the map layout. From the current position (Baba at 1 left, 5 down), I need to move up to reach the ""is"" block at 5 steps down. Wait, the ""is"" block is at 5 steps down, same as Baba's position. So maybe I'm already next to it. If I can take that ""is"" block and move it to the ""door"" which is at 8 right, 2 down. That would require moving right and down. But there's a wall at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe there's a path.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ""win"" rule at 9 right, 1 up. But that's far. Maybe first, create a rule like ""door IS WIN"" or ""you IS WIN."" Let's think. If I can make ""door"" a Win, then pushing the door would reach the Win. But to do that, I need to reposition the ""is"" block.

So possible steps: move the ""is"" block from 5 steps down to near the ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down. To do that, I need to move right and down from the current position. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see:

From Baba's position (1 left, 5 down), moving right would take me to 0 left, 5 down. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, but maybe not in this row. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. Let me check the objects again:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps down

So moving right from Baba's position (1 left,5 down) would go towards 0 left,5 down. But there's no wall mentioned there. Maybe I can move right. Then right again to 2 left,5 down, etc., until reaching 8 steps right. But that's a long path. Alternatively, move down to reach the ""door"" area.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 1 step up. If I can move that to combine with ""win"" to make ""win IS YOU"" or something. But ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls at 4 steps right,1 up. Maybe push the walls? But walls are defined as ""wall,"" which I think are immovable unless their property is changed.

Wait, the initial rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move objects that aren't ""stop."" The ""stop"" is at 3 right,2 down. So if I'm moving towards the ""win"" at 9 right,1 up, but there's a wall at 4 right,1 up. Since I'm Baba (you), can I push the wall? Normally, walls are stop, but if the rule ""wall IS STOP"" is active, which it seems to be, then walls are stop. So I can't push them. Therefore, I need to find another way.

Maybe create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""baba IS NOT STOP"" or ""wall IS NOT STOP."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to redefine those properties.

Looking at the current rules: ""baba is you,"" ""rule `is`"" is present multiple times. If I can take an ""is"" block and place it next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to make ""wall IS NOT STOP,"" that would help. But where is the ""wall"" rule? There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. So perhaps moving that ""wall"" rule and combining it with ""stop"" and an ""is"" block to change its property.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, maybe I can write ""STOP IS NOTHING"" or similar, but I need the text blocks to do that.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. If I can make the door a win by creating ""door IS WIN,"" then going to the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win.""

Currently, ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block from 5 steps down to near the door. From Baba's position (1 left,5 down), moving right 7 times would get to 8 right, but there's a wall at 4 right in various positions. Maybe a detour is needed.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block at 5 steps down (which is where Baba is) and place it next to ""door"" and ""win."" But the distance is significant. Maybe first move the ""is"" block up to the initial position (1 step up) and then right.

Wait, the ""is"" block at 5 steps down is where Baba is. So if I can take that ""is"" block and move it to the door's location. Let's see:

From current position (Baba with ""is"" at 5 down), move right to get to 0 left,5 down. Then right again to 1 left,5 down, etc., until reaching 8 right,2 down. But the path might be blocked by walls at 4 steps right. For example, at 4 steps right, there's a wall in various positions. So moving right past 4 steps might be blocked.

Alternatively, move down to reach the door area. From 5 down, moving down to 6 down, but there's a wall at 4 right,5 down. Not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to create a rule that makes Baba a win. For example, ""baba IS WIN."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. So from Baba's current position (1 left,5 down), moving up to 1 left,4 down, then left to 0 left,4 down, etc., but there are walls at 4 steps right. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 1 step up. If I move that block to combine with ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,4 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" block from 1 step up to near the ""baba"" rule and ""win"" rule.

But this requires navigating through the map. Let's see:

Current ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I move down from there to reach the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,4 down. So move down once to 1 step up's position becomes 1 step down? Wait, the directions are relative. Maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinates.

Alternatively, think in terms of grid movement. Each step up, down, left, right changes the position by one in that direction. The ""is"" block at 1 step up is directly above the current Baba position. So if I move up, I'd be at that ""is"" block. Then take that block and move it to the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,4 down. That would require moving down from the ""is"" block to reach the ""baba"" rule.

So the path could be: move up to grab the ""is"" block, then move down to the ""baba"" rule, place the ""is"" block there, then move to the ""win"" rule and create ""baba IS WIN.""

Once that rule is active, since Baba is you, moving to the ""win"" object would make it active.

But how to execute this step by step. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move up to the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
2. Pick up the ""is"" block (assuming you can carry it).
3. Move down to the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,4 steps down.
4. Place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""
5. This creates ""baba IS WIN,"" so touching the ""win"" object would win.

But how to move the ""is"" block. In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by pushing them with your avatar, but only if they are not ""stop."" Since ""is"" is a rule, it's probably movable unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it. Currently, there's no ""stop"" on the ""is"" blocks.

So the actions would be:

- Up to get to the ""is"" block.
- Then move down to the ""baba"" rule.
- Place the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba IS WIN.""

But the ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, which is far away. Maybe after creating the rule, you can just walk to the ""win"" which is now a Baba (since you're Baba and it's Win).

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" is an object that when you touch it, you win. If I can make Baba into Win, then touching any Win object (which might be the same tile) would work.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me check the current active rules again. The only active rule is ""baba is you."" All other rules are objects on the map that can be moved.

So the plan is to create a new rule that makes Baba a Win. To do that, take an ""is"" block and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form ""baba IS win.""

The ""win"" object is at 9 steps right,1 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left,4 steps down. The ""is"" blocks are at 1 step up and 5 steps down (where Baba is).

So from Baba's current position (which has the ""is"" block at 5 steps down), move up to get to the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Then move down to the ""baba"" rule. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" block is already at 5 steps down (Baba's position), maybe take that ""is"" block and move it to the ""baba"" and ""win"" location.

But moving from 5 steps down to 4 steps down (to reach the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,4 down) would require moving down once. Then place the ""is"" block there. Then move to the ""win"" location.

But there's a wall at 4 steps right in various positions. This is tricky. Maybe another approach: Use the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Move up to grab it, then move left to reach the ""baba"" rule.

Wait, the ""is"" block at 1 step up is directly above Baba's current position. So:

1. Action: up (move to the ""is"" block).
2. Then, move left to reach the ""baba"" rule which is at 1 left,4 steps down. Wait, moving left from the ""is"" block (which is 1 step up from Baba) would take me to 1 left,1 step up. Then need to move down to 1 left,0 step up, then down to 4 steps down. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""is"" block at 1 step up, move down to the original position, then left to the ""baba"" rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler solution: Since the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down, which is adjacent to the ""is"" block at 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win,"" maybe create ""you IS WIN,"" which would make me (as you) a win.

The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. So from the ""you"" rule's position (1 right,5 down), move up to 1 right,4 down, then right to 2 right,4 down, etc., but there are walls at 4 steps right.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block from 5 steps down to near the ""you"" and ""win"" objects. But again, pathfinding is an issue.

Another idea: The ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. If I can make ""door IS YOU,"" then pushing the door would make me a win. To do that, create ""door IS YOU"" by placing an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you.""

The ""you"" is at 1 right,5 down. The ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. So the distance is significant. Maybe first move the ""is"" block to the ""door"" area.

But given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the simplest valid action is to move towards the ""win"" object, even though blocked, hoping that by redefining rules, the path clears.

Alternatively, since the last action was ""up"" and it failed, maybe try a different direction. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say.

In the end, the best bet might be to move towards the ""win"" object by going right, even if blocked, in the hope that a rule change will allow passage. Or try to push a wall if possible, but since walls are stop, likely not.

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 1 right,1 up. Maybe using the ball to push walls? But balls might have their own rules. Not sure.

Given the previous failed actions, maybe the assistant needs to simply output a valid action, even if it's idle, but the system is defaulting to idle because the reasoning is flawed.

But according to the problem, I need to choose exactly one action from the listed ones: idle, up, right, down, left.

Considering the latest observation, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" and the ""win"" is far to the right. The closest movable ""is"" block is at 5 steps down (Baba's position). Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block to combine with ""you"" and ""win"" to make ""you IS WIN,"" thereby making the player a win.

To do that, from Baba's position (1 left,5 down), move right to reach the ""you"" rule at 1 right,5 down. Then move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win.""

But the path requires moving right from 1 left to 1 right (so one step right), then up to reach the ""win"" at 1 up. But ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, which is far.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""you"" and ""win"" located at 9 right,1 up. But that's a long way.

Given the time I've spent and the system's previous failures, perhaps the correct action here is to move right towards the ""win"" object, hoping that by redefining rules, the path becomes clear. Or try to push a wall if possible, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, since the ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down, maybe move towards there to interact with it. But without a rule change, it's just a door.

In conclusion, the best valid action based on the current observation, considering the need to move towards a goal and possibly interact with rules, is to move right towards the ""win"" object, even if blocked, in the hope that a rule change will make it passable.

Let's see. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls and stops blocking the path. Wait, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to use that? But how?

The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule? For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" text block next to ""baba,"" but I need to check if that's possible.

Currently, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move it to the ball's position, maybe I can make ""ball is win"" or something else. But I have to be careful not to hit any ""stop"" or ""wall"" objects while moving.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can combine that with another rule. If I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would win the level. But how to create that rule?

The ""is"" rule is nearby at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move that ""is"" to be next to ""win,"" then maybe I can create ""win is win"" or something, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to where ""baba"" and ""is"" are. But the ""win"" is currently blocked by walls. There's a wall at 4 steps right, so maybe I need to go around it.

Looking at my current position, I think I'm at the initial position of ""baba."" The ""is"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move up, I can get to that ""is"" rule. Then, perhaps move it to attach to ""baba"" and ""win."" But how?

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. If I can make ""baba is win"" by combining ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win,"" then touching the win object would work. But I need to physically move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move the ""is"" rule. Let's see:

Current objects nearby:
- ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up.
- ""ball"" at 1 up.
- ""wall"" at 3 right, 1 up.

Maybe move the ""is"" rule to the right towards the ""win"" location. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move down to the ""you"" rule area. The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. If I can make ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would work. But how to get there?

Alternatively, look at the door at 7 steps right, 2 steps down. Maybe pushing the door by moving into it, but doors are typically passable unless stopped. But since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can enter the door. But the door's rule is ""door,"" which by default might be a blocker unless a rule says otherwise. The current active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so doors are probably stops unless there's a rule allowing passage. But there's no rule like ""door is pass"" here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So anything stopped can't be moved through. The door is a separate object. Maybe I need to find a way to remove the stop rule or change its property.

Alternatively, focus on the ""win"" object. If I can create a rule that makes ""win"" something I can touch. But the ""win"" rule is already there; it's a text block saying ""win."" To reach it, I might need to move past the walls. The path to the win is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe push the walls? But walls are defined by ""wall is stop,"" so I can't move them unless I change that rule.

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps left. If I can move that ""wall"" rule to a different position, maybe I can remove the stop property from the walls. For example, if I make ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls wouldn't block. But how to do that?

Currently, there's a ""wall"" text block at 2 steps left. If I can move that ""wall"" rule next to another object, like ""stop,"" and change it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new ones.

Another idea: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can manipulate the ""is"" rules to make myself win. For example, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's check the positions:

- ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down.
- ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down.
- ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up.

So, if I can move the ""is"" from 1 left,5 down to be between ""baba"" (2 left,5 down) and ""win"" (8 right,1 up), but that's a long distance. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. The other ""is"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move that ""is"" down to the ""baba"" and ""you"" area.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at 1 left,1 up down to 1 left,5 down (where the ""you"" rule is).
2. Then, place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
3. Then, move to the ""win"" object, which would now be triggered since I'm Baba and ""baba is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" rule step by step. Let's see:

Current position after previous actions: The last action was ""right,"" which might have moved me to the right. But looking at the current observation, after the last action, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up, ball is 1 up, etc.

Wait, the current observation shows that after the last action (right), the ""is"" rule is now at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, ball is 1 step up, etc. So perhaps the agent moved right, and now the ""is"" is in a different position.

To create ""baba is win,"" I need to have the ""is"" rule adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,5 down, and ""win"" is at 8 right,1 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closer ""win"" instance? No, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 up.

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule at 8 right and 1 up. If I can get the ""is"" rule next to it and ""baba,"" but the distance is too big. Maybe instead, use the ""ball"" as a intermediary? Not sure.

Another approach: Since the ""you"" rule is already attached to ""baba"" (from previous rules), maybe the goal is just to reach the ""win"" object, which is a text block. In some levels, touching the ""win"" object is enough if you're the ""you"" entity. Since ""baba is you,"" touching ""win"" should win the level. But the problem is the path is blocked by walls and stops.

Looking at the path to the ""win"" at 9 right,1 up: there's a wall at 4 right,1 up, and more walls to the right. So to get there, I might need to move the walls or find a way around.

Alternatively, the door at 8 right,2 down. If I can push the door, maybe it opens a path. But doors are usually passable unless stopped. However, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right,2 down, which might block movement in that area.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right,2 down. So anything at that position or adjacent might be stopped. The door is at 8 right,2 down, which is far away. Maybe moving the ""stop"" rule elsewhere to remove its blocking effect.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be able to move text blocks. Since I'm Baba (you), and there's no rule restricting moving text, unless they're defined as stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, so unless there's a rule saying ""stop is stop,"" which there is (probably implicit), I can move it.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, maybe I can create a path. For example, move the ""stop"" from 3 right,2 down to somewhere else, like next to a wall so it doesn't block anymore.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that removes the stop property from walls. For example, create ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" text block.

Hmm. This is complicated. Let's recap:

Active rules: Only ""baba is you.""

Objects:
- Multiple walls, stops, doors, balls, win.

Goal: Reach the ""win"" object at 9 right,1 up.

Barriers: Walls and stops. Need to find a way around.

Possible solutions:
1. Move text blocks to create new rules that allow passage, like making walls passable or stops non-blocking.
2. Manipulate rules to make self win, allowing touching the win object.
3. Use the door if possible.

Let's try solution 1. To make walls passable, need to change their property. For example, ""wall is move"" or ""wall is nothing."" To do this, need to move the ""wall"" text block next to an ""is"" and the desired property.

The ""wall"" text block is at 2 left. If I can move that ""wall"" rule next to an ""is"" and, say, ""nothing,"" then create ""wall is nothing."" But there's no ""nothing"" text block. Alternatively, use ""move"" if available.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at 1 left,1 up. Move the ""wall"" rule (at 2 left) to be next to ""is"" and ""move,"" creating ""wall is move."" Then, walls wouldn't block.

But where is the ""move"" text block? I don't see it in the objects. So that's not possible.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 1 up. If I can create a rule like ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win. But the ball is far to the left, and the ""win"" is far to the right. Not sure.

Alternatively, push the walls. Since walls are stopped, but if I can move them by being adjacent and pushing. But the rule ""wall is stop"" means they can't be moved unless there's a rule allowing it. Since there's no such rule, I can't push walls.

Wait, but maybe I can move the ""wall"" text block itself. Since it's a text block, and I'm Baba (you), I can move it unless it's defined as stop. The text block ""wall"" has the property ""wall,"" which by default might not make it stop. Wait, no—the ""wall"" text block's property is determined by the rules. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""wall"" rule at 2 left, which means ""wall is [something]."" Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step up""—wait, no, looking back:

Objects on the map include:
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left
- wall 4 steps to the right
- etc.

So the ""wall"" text block is a separate object. The rule ""wall"" is a text block that, when combined with ""is,"" defines the property. For example, if there's a rule ""wall IS STOP,"" then walls are stop. But in the current active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you."" So the ""wall"" text block's property isn't defined yet. Wait, no—the active rules are the ones formed by the text blocks. The objects list includes ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left,"" which means there's a text block saying ""wall IS [something]."" But what's the something? Wait, no—the way the rules are formed is that each text block is a subject and property. For example, ""WALL IS STOP"" is a rule made by placing ""WALL"" next to ""IS"" next to ""STOP.""

In the current observation, the objects include:
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left: this means there's a text block ""wall"" adjacent to an ""is"" and another property? Or is it just a standalone ""wall"" rule? Wait, no—probably, the ""rule `wall`"" notation indicates a text block that is part of a rule. For example, if there's a text block ""wall"" next to ""is"" next to ""stop,"" then the rule would be ""wall is stop."" But in the current objects, the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left is likely a text block ""wall"" that hasn't been paired with an ""is"" and property yet. So its property isn't defined, which means it's just an object named ""wall"" with no special properties.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify. In Baba Is You, a rule is formed when three text blocks are placed adjacent: [Subject] IS [Property]. For example, ""BABA IS YOU"" is a rule made by placing ""BABA"" next to ""IS"" next to ""YOU."" Once such a rule is formed, the subject (BABA) gains the property (YOU).

In the current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other text blocks like ""wall,"" ""win,"" etc., are either part of unformed rules or have their properties defined by existing rules.

Looking at the objects:
- There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left. This means there's a text block ""wall"" somewhere, but not yet part of a complete rule (i.e., not adjacent to an ""is"" and a property). So the wall's property isn't defined yet. Similarly, the ""rule `win`"" at 8 right and 1 up is a text block ""win"" not yet part of a rule.

Therefore, the walls and win objects currently have no special properties because their defining rules are incomplete. This means I can interact with them normally, like any other object.

If that's the case, then maybe I can push the walls or move past them since they don't have the ""stop"" property. Wait, but in the objects list, there are also ""wall"" objects (not rules) at positions like 4 steps right and 1 step up. These are instances of walls that might have properties defined by other rules. But since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" and the ""wall"" rules are incomplete, those wall objects might not have the ""stop"" property.

This is a bit ambiguous, but assuming that the wall objects (like the one at 4 right,1 up) are not stopped because their defining rules are incomplete, then maybe I can move past them.

If that's the case, then the path to the win at 9 right,1 up is blocked by walls, but since those walls aren't stopped, I can walk through them. Wait, but in Baba Is You, usually, walls are stopped unless a rule says otherwise. But if their rules are incomplete, maybe they aren't. This needs clarification.

Alternatively, maybe the wall objects are static and can't be moved, but since there's no rule making them ""stop,"" I can walk over them. But that's not typical gameplay. Usually, walls are stopped by default unless a rule says they're not.

This is a bit confusing. Let's try to proceed.

If I can move past the walls, then the path to the win is possible. Let's check the path:

From my current position (assuming after previous actions, maybe at the ""baba"" rule location), moving right towards the win:

- There's a wall at 4 right,1 up. If it's not stopped, I can move through it. But if it is stopped, I can't.

Alternatively, maybe the ""wall"" objects are just obstacles that can be walked over, but that's not standard. I think in this case, since the rules defining the walls are incomplete (the ""rule `wall`"" text blocks are not paired with ""is"" and a property), the walls might not have the ""stop"" property. So I can walk through them.

If that's the case, then I can move right past the walls towards the win. The ""win"" object is at 9 right,1 up. So the path would be:

Move right from my current position (unknown, but assuming I'm near the ""baba"" rule at 2 left,5 down) towards the win.

But the last observation shows that after moving right, the ""is"" rule is at 1 left,1 up, and the ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,5 down. So perhaps my current position is near the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to create ""baba is win."" Let's see:

The ""win"" rule is at 8 right,1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,5 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left,1 up. The distance is significant. Maybe there's a closer ""win"" instance? No, only one.

Alternatively, use the ""ball"" to create a rule. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win. The ball is at 1 up, which is closer. So the plan would be:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 1 left,1 up to be next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" creating ""ball is win.""
2. Then, move to the ball, which is now a win object.

But how to place the ""is"" rule there. The ""is"" is at 1","

Let's see. The current active rules are ""baba is you"". So, I'm controlled by Baba. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But wait, there are walls in the way. Specifically, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right, and another at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. ""Stop"" means that object can't be moved through. So moving straight right might not work because of those walls and the stop.

But maybe I can manipulate the rules. Let's look for text blocks. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can change a rule. Also, there's another ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down, near the ""you"" rule. 

The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"" is active, I can move. If I can change ""you"" to something else, maybe I can become the win condition. For example, if I make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would win the level. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up is close to the ball, but not sure. The other ""is"" is at 5 steps down, next to ""you"". If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", that could work. 

But how to move the ""is"" blocks? I need to check if they are movable. The rules say that unless an object is ""stop"" or similar, it can be moved. The ""is"" rules don't have any properties restricting movement, so they should be movable. 

Looking at my current position, I need to see where I am. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So my position is there. To reach the ""is"" at 5 steps down, I need to move down. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down, but maybe I can navigate around. Alternatively, the ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up is closer. 

If I move up to that ""is"" and then move it to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", that would make ""baba is win"". Then, touching the ""win"" object would make me win. But how to move the ""is"" block? Let's think step by step. 

First, move from my position (2 left, 5 down) to the ""is"" at 1 left, 1 up. That would require moving up 4 steps and left 1 step. But the path might be blocked. There's a wall at 3 steps right, 1 step up. Wait, my current position is 2 left, 5 down. To get to 1 left, 1 up, I need to move up 4 and left 1. Let's check if there are walls in between. Between here and that ""is"" block, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, which is to the right of me, so not in the path. The path left and up should be clear. 

Once I pick up the ""is"" block, I can move it to the ""baba"" rule (which is at 2 left, 5 down) and the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 1 up. But maybe placing it between ""baba"" and ""win"" would create ""baba is win"". 

Alternatively, the ""is"" at 5 steps down is next to the ""you"" rule. If I move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 8 right, 2 down. If I can push the ball onto the door, but I need to see if the door is a win condition. The active rules still have ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to move the ""win"" rule closer. But ""win"" is a rule, so maybe I can move it. But the ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 1 up. Moving it might not help unless I can make it part of Baba. 

Alternatively, if I can make the door the win condition. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I change the ""win"" rule to point to door, then touching the door would win. But how? 

Another thought: the ""ball"" is at 1 right, 1 up. If I can move the ball to the door, but I don't know if that's necessary. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push blocks. But the walls are ""stop"", so I can't push them. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 2 down. So anything on ""stop"" can't be moved. The walls are defined as ""wall"", which might be stop by default? Or maybe the ""stop"" rule is making those walls immovable. 

So, the main obstacles are the walls and the stop rule. To get to the win rule, I need to find a path around. But given the layout, it's probably blocked. So manipulating the rules seems necessary. 

The key is to create a rule that makes touching the win object possible. For example, ""baba is win"" would make me win just by existing. Or ""win is you"", but since I'm you, that would also work. 

So, to create ""baba is win"", I need to take the ""is"" text block and place it between ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left, 5 down. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 1 up. The ""is"" blocks are at 1 left, 1 up and at 5 down. 

Maybe moving the ""is"" at 5 down (next to ""you"") to connect ""baba"" and ""win"". But how to get there? From my current position (2 left, 5 down), moving down isn't possible because there's a wall at 3 right, 5 down. Wait, the wall is at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down. So my position is 2 left, 5 down. To move down, I would be at 2 left, 6 down, but there's a wall there. So I can't move down. 

Therefore, I need to find another way. Maybe move up to the ""is"" at 1 left, 1 up. Let's see: from 2 left,5 down, moving up 4 steps and left 1 step would reach 1 left,1 up. Is the path clear? Between here and that ""is"", there's a wall at 3 right,1 up, which is to the right of the path, so not blocking. So I can move up and left. 

Once I have the ""is"" block, I need to move it to connect ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,5 down, and the ""win"" is at 8 right,1 up. The distance is quite big. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the ""baba"" rule first, then move it towards the ""win"". 

Alternatively, place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" directly. But the positions are far apart. Maybe moving the ""is"" to the ""win"" rule and then adjusting. 

Alternatively, create a rule like ""win is you"", making the win object act as you. But I'm already you. 

Hmm. Another angle: the ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. If I can make the door a win, but how? 

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is at 8 right,1 up. If I can move that rule to the door's position, then touching the door would be win. But moving the ""win"" rule would require picking it up, which might be possible. 

But to do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" rule at 8 right,1 up. There's a wall at 4 right,1 up, and another at 3 right,2 down. The path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" blocks to redefine the win condition. 

Let me summarize possible steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 1 left,1 up.
2. Pick it up and carry it to the ""baba"" rule at 2 left,5 down.
3. Place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".
4. Then, moving towards the ""win"" rule would make me win.

But how to reach the ""win"" rule after placing the ""is""? It's far away. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 5 down (next to ""you"") to create ""baba is win"". The ""you"" rule is at 5 down, so if I can make ""baba is win"", then since I'm you, touching win would work. 

To do that, move the ""is"" at 5 down to connect ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""baba"" is at 2 left,5 down. The ""is"" at 5 down is at 1 left,5 down. So moving the ""is"" one step left to 0 left,5 down, next to ""baba"" (which is at 2 left,5 down)? Wait, no. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left,5 down. The ""is"" at 5 down is at 1 left,5 down. So to connect ""baba"" (2 left,5 down) with ""win"" (8 right,1 up), I need to place an ""is"" between them. 

Maybe moving the ""is"" from 1 left,5 down to 2 left,5 down (next to ""baba""), then another ""is"" to connect to ""win"". But there's only one ""is"" block there. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" from 1 left,1 up. Let's try that path again. 

Move up 4 steps from current position (2 left,5 down) to 2 left,1 down. Then left 1 step to 1 left,1 down. Then up 1 step to reach the ""is"" at 1 left,1 up. 

Once I have that ""is"", I need to carry it to the ""baba"" rule. From 1 left,1 up, move left to 0 left,1 up, then down to 0 left,5 down (but there's a wall at 3 right,5 down, so maybe not). Wait, my current position after getting the ""is"" is 1 left,1 up. To get to ""baba"" at 2 left,5 down, I need to move left 1 step (to 0 left,1 up), then down 4 steps to 0 left,5 down. But between here and there, is there a wall? At 3 right,2 steps down, which is not in the path. So the path should be clear. 

Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"". So the rule becomes ""baba is [something]"". Then, I need to place another ""is"" next to ""win"". But I only have one ""is"" block. So maybe take the ""is"" and place it between ""baba"" and ""win"". 

But the distance is too big. Alternatively, place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"", but how? 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 8 right,1 up. If I can move the ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" (2 left,5 down) and ""win"" (8 right,1 up), that would create ""baba is win"". But moving the ""is"" block that far would require many steps. 

Alternatively, create a new ""is"" rule by combining existing ones. But I don't think that's possible. 

Another idea: since there's a ""ball"" at 1 right,1 up, maybe move the ""is"" to make ""ball is win"", then push the ball to the win spot. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, make ""you"" into ""win"". The ""you"" rule is at 5 down. If I can change ""you"" to ""win"", then since I'm you, I would be win. 

To do that, take the ""is"" block at 5 down and place it next to ""you"" and ""win"". The ""you"" is at 5 down, and ""win"" is at 8 right,1 up. So moving the ""is"" from 5 down to connect ""you"" and ""win"". 

From my current position (2 left,5 down), to get to the ""is"" at 5 down (1 left,5 down), I need to move left 1 step. Then take that ""is"" and move it to the ""you"" and ""win"". 

But ""you"" is at 5 down, same level as the ""is"". So placing the ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win"" would require moving it right and up. But the path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, create ""win is you"", which would make the win object act as you. But ""you"" is already a rule. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a step-by-step plan:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 1 left,1 up.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move left to 0 left,1 up.
4. Move down to 0 left,5 down.
5. Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" at 2 left,5 down, creating ""baba is [something]"".
6. Then, move to the ""win"" rule at 8 right,1 up and place another ""is"" to make ""baba is win"".

But I only have one ""is"" block. So step 5 would leave ""baba is [nothing]"", which isn't useful. 

Alternative approach: use the ""is"" at 5 down. 

1. Move from current position (2 left,5 down) left 1 step to 1 left,5 down (the ""is"" and ""you"" rules).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move the ""is"" to the right next to ""you"" (which is at 5 down), making ""you is [something]"".
4. Then, place another ""is"" to connect ""you"" with ""win"". But again, only one ""is"" block.

Hmm. Maybe I need to create a new ""is"" rule by combining text blocks, but the game doesn't allow that. You can only move existing text blocks. 

Wait, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down, and another at 5 steps down. Maybe I can use one of those. 

Another thought: the ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. If I can make the door a win, then touching it would work. To do that, create ""door is win"". But how? 

I need to move an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is at 8 right,1 up, and the ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. So placing an ""is"" between them vertically. 

From my current position, moving right 4 steps to reach 8 right would be tough because of walls. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 5 down. Move it to the door's position. 

This is quite tricky. Maybe the solution is to push the ball to the door, but I don't see how that helps. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the ""win"" rule to a reachable place. But ""win"" is a rule, so I can move it if it's not stopped. 

The ""win"" rule is at 8 right,1 up. To move it, I need to go there, but there's a wall at 4 right,1 up. So maybe I can move the wall? But the wall is defined as ""wall"", and unless there's a rule that allows moving it, I can't. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right,2 down. So objects on ""stop"" can't be moved. The walls are separate; their immovability might come from the ""stop"" rule. 

Alternatively, change the property of the wall to something else. For example, make ""wall is push"" or remove the ""wall"" property. 

There's a ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left. If I can move that rule away, the wall at 4 right,1 up would no longer be a wall. 

So, steps:

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 2 left.
2. Pick it up and move it away, say to the left.
3. Now, the wall at 4 right,1 up is no longer a wall, so it can be moved through.
4. Then, go to the ""win"" rule at 8 right,1 up and touch it.

But how to move the ""wall"" rule? Let's see. 

From my current position (2 left,5 down), move left to 1 left,5 down (where the ""is"" and ""you"" rules are). Then, move up to 1 left,1 down, then up to 1 left,1 up (where the ""is"" block is). No, the ""wall"" rule is at 2 left,1 step to the left. Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. So its position is 2 left, same level as the ball (1 step up). 

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 step to the left. So from my current position (2 left,5 down), moving left 0 steps (same x) and up to 1 step up would reach 2 left,1 up, where the ""ball"" is. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left, so maybe at the same level as the ball? 

This is getting confusing. Let me try to visualize the map based on the observation.

36,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You puzzle. Let's start by looking at the current observation.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around and potentially manipulate other rules. The goal here is probably to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually a flag or something similar. But I need to check if the win condition has been changed by any rules. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. So normally, reaching that should win the level.

Now, let's map out where everything is. Baba is at 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. The `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down, and `you` is at 5 steps down. So the `you` rule is on the same horizontal line as the `is` rule and Baba. That makes sense because ""baba is you"" is the main rule here.

The walls are spread out: one to the left at 2 steps left, and several to the right starting at 3 steps right and going down. There's also a `stop` rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which means anything touching that wall or object is stopped. The `door` is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, but I don't know if it's locked or not. The `ball` is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down, which might be a movable object.

The path to the `win` object seems blocked by walls. From the current position of Baba (2 left, 5 down), moving up might be a way to reach higher ground. Let's see: if I move up, I can get to the `is` rule at 1 left, 1 up. Then maybe move towards the `win` rule at 9 right, 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up, and another at 4 right, 1 down. The `stop` is at 3 right, 2 down, which is a problem if I try to go that way.

Wait, maybe I can manipulate the rules to remove obstacles. For example, if I can create a ""wall is stop"" rule, then existing walls would act as stops, but I don't have the `wall` rule nearby to modify. Alternatively, changing ""win"" to something else. But the `win` rule is already there; maybe I need to move it?

Baba can push objects, right? So if there's a rule `is` nearby, I can move it. The `is` rule is 1 step left and 1 step up from Baba's current position. If I move left, I can reach that `is` rule. Let's see: current position is 2 left, 5 down. Moving left once would place me at 1 left, 5 down. Then I can pick up the `is` rule and move it elsewhere. For example, moving it to the `win` position so that ""baba is win"" makes Baba the win condition. Wait, no. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so changing the `win` rule to ""baba is win"" might not help because ""you"" is still active. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe create a ""stop is you"" rule, making the stop blocks become movable. But how? To do that, I need to have the `stop` text block. The `stop` rule is at 3 right, 2 down. If I can move that, but I'm not sure if I can reach it. Let's think about the movement.

From current position (2 left, 5 down), moving up steps:

1. Move up to 2 left, 4 down.
2. Then up to 2 left, 3 down.
3. Up to 2 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 down (the `stop` rule's position is 3 right, 2 down). Wait, the wall is at 4 right, 2 down. Wait, the `stop` rule is at 2 right, 2 down. So the wall at 4 right, 2 down is separate.

Wait, the `stop` rule is at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So from Baba's current position (2 left, 5 down), moving right would get me closer. Let me sketch this mentally:

Baba: 2L,5D

Walls:
- 2L (leftmost wall)
- 4R,1U
- 4R (rightmost base wall)
- 4R,1D
- 3R,2D (stop rule)
- 4R,2D (wall)
- 7R,2D (door)
- 4R,3D (wall)
- 7R,3D (ball)
- 4R,4D (wall)
- 4R,5D (wall)

So moving right from Baba's position (2L,5D) would go towards the right side. But there's a wall at 4R,5D, which is directly to the right. So I can't move right directly. The path to the `win` at 9R,1U is blocked by walls at 4R,1U and others. The `ball` is at 7R,3D, maybe I can push it, but I need to get there.

Alternatively, the `is` rule is at 1L,1U. If I can move that `is` rule near the `win` rule, I could create ""win is [something]"". For example, moving `is` to 8R,1U (where the `win` is) and then placing another text block to make ""win is you"", but I don't have the `you` block there.

Wait, the `you` rule is at 5D. If I can move the `you` rule upwards, maybe I can combine it with the `win` rule. Let me think. Current `you` is at 5 steps down. If I move it up to where the `win` is, then ""win is you"" would make touching the win object make me win. But how to move the `you` rule?

Baba is at 2L,5D. To get to the `you` rule at 5D, I need to move left to 1L,5D (where the `is` rule is), then down? No, the `you` is at the same horizontal line as the `is` and Baba. So from 2L,5D, moving left to 1L,5D (grabbing the `is` rule), then moving up to 1L,4D, 1L,3D, 1L,2D, 1L,1D, then right to where the `you` rule is at 5D's horizontal line. Wait, the `you` is at 5D, same as the `is` and Baba's starting position. So moving left from 2L,5D to 1L,5D (grabbing `is`), then maybe moving up to 1L,1D, then right to 5D's horizontal? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to push the `win` rule. The `win` is at 8R,1U. If I can move that to be under Baba, but I need to have the `is` rule to create a new rule. For example, move the `is` rule to 8R,1U, making ""win is [something]"". But what? If I can make ""win is you"", then touching win would make me win. But the `you` is at 5D. So perhaps move the `you` rule up to 8R,1U. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Move left to grab the `is` rule at 1L,1U. Wait, no. The `is` rule in the current observation is at 1L,1U. So from Baba's position (2L,5D), moving left twice would get to 0L,5D, then up to 0L,4D, etc. Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Alternatively, current `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up from Baba's position. So from 2L,5D, moving left once to 1L,5D, then up once to 1L,4D, then up again to 1L,3D, then up to 1L,2D, then up to 1L,1D (where the `is` rule is). Once I pick up the `is` rule, I can move it somewhere else.

Once I have the `is` rule, I can place it next to the `win` rule (8R,1U) and then add a `you` or another property to create ""win is you"". But the `you` is at 5D, so I need to move that up as well.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by placing `is` next to Baba and `win`. But Baba is at 2L,5D. If I move `is` to be next to Baba, making ""baba is win"", then since ""baba is you"" is still active, it would mean you are win, so touching win makes you win. But how to move the `is` rule there.

This is tricky. Let's try step-by-step movement:

- Current position: 2L,5D
- Move left to 1L,5D (this is where the `is` rule is at 1L,1U? Wait, no. Wait the `is` rule in the current observation is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So from Baba's position (2L,5D), moving left once gets to 1L,5D. Then moving up once gets to 1L,4D, then up to 1L,3D, 1L,2D, 1L,1D. At 1L,1D, there's the `is` rule. So to pick that up, I need to move to that position.

So steps:

1. Move left from 2L,5D to 1L,5D.
2. Move up from 1L,5D to 1L,4D.
3. Move up to 1L,3D.
4. Move up to 1L,2D.
5. Move up to 1L,1D (grab `is` rule).
6. Now, with `is` rule, need to move it to where the `win` is at 8R,1U.

From 1L,1D, moving right towards the `win`:

- Right to 2L,1D
- Right to 3L,1D
- Right to 4L,1D (but there's a wall at 4R,1U, which is 4 steps right and 1 step up from the starting point. Wait, the walls are at 4R,1U and others. So moving right from 1L,1D, passing through 2R,1D, 3R,1D, 4R,1D. But at 4R,1D, there's a wall. So can't move past that.

Hmm, so maybe need to find another path. Alternatively, move the `is` rule up and to the right. From 1L,1D, move up to 1L,0D (but that's off the map?), or maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to adjust my understanding of the map's coordinate system.

Assuming that ""1 step up"" from a position moves Baba one cell north, ""right"" one cell east, etc. So the map is a grid, and each object has coordinates relative to some origin, probably Baba's starting position.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to the top-left corner. But without a visual, it's hard to tell. Let's try to imagine the grid based on the given observations.

The `win` is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up from the current position. So that's far to the right and north. The `stop` is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down, which is southeast of Baba's position.

To reach the `win`, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up. Maybe I can push that wall aside by moving the `is` rule to create a new rule that makes the wall movable.

Wait, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push"", then walls would be pushable. But how? I need to have the `wall` text block. There's a rule `wall` at 2 steps to the left. So perhaps move that `wall` rule somewhere else.

From Baba's current position, moving left to grab the `wall` rule at 2L. Let's see:

1. Move left from 2L,5D to 1L,5D.
2. Move left again to 0L,5D (but is there a `wall` rule there? No, the `wall` rule is at 2L, which is two steps left from the starting position. So from 2L,5D, moving left once gets to 1L,5D, then again to 0L,5D. Wait, the initial observation says there's a `wall` rule at 2 step to the left. So that's two steps left from Baba's starting position. So to reach that `wall` rule, Baba needs to move left twice.

So:

1. Move left to 1L,5D.
2. Move left to 0L,5D (which is 2 steps left from the original position). At this point, is there a `wall` rule? The observation says ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left"", so yes, at 0L,5D (assuming the starting position is 2L,5D, moving left two steps gets to 0L,5D, which has the `wall` rule).

Once there, pick up the `wall` rule and move it. For example, move it to the `is` rule's position to create ""wall is stop"" or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, move the `is` rule to the `win` position and then add a `you` to make ""win is you"". But the `you` is at 5D. So need to move the `you` rule up.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to prioritize. The main goal is to reach the `win` object. Since ""baba is you"", touching the `win` should win, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I can push the walls aside by moving them using the `is` rule.

For example, if I can create a rule like ""wall is push"", then I can push the walls. To do that, I need to have the `wall` text block and the `push` text block. But I don't see a `push` rule. Alternatively, create ""wall is stop"" which might not help, but if I can make ""stop is you"", then the stop blocks become movable.

Alternatively, use the `ball` to push the walls. The `ball` is at 7R,3D. If I can move the `ball` towards the walls, maybe I can push them out of the way. But to move the `ball`, I need to be adjacent to it and have the necessary rules.

Wait, the `ball` is a movable object because it's not defined as ""STOP"" unless there's a rule saying so. The current active rules don't mention `ball` as stop, so I can push it.

So here's an idea: move the `ball` towards the wall at 4R,1U, pushing it aside so I can path to the `win`. But how to get to the `ball`?

From Baba's position (2L,5D), moving right towards the `ball`:

- Right to 3L,5D (but there's a wall at 4R,5D, so can't go further right directly).
- Maybe move up and then right? Let's see:

1. Move up from 2L,5D to 2L,4D.
2. Move up to 2L,3D.
3. Move up to 2L,2D.
4. Move up to 2L,1D.
5. Now, move right to 3L,1D.
6. Right to 4L,1D (but there's a wall at 4R,1U, which is 4 steps right and 1 step up. So if I'm at 4L,1D, moving up would reach the wall. But maybe I can push the wall if I have the `ball`.

Wait, the `ball` is at 7R,3D. So from 2L,1D, moving right to 3L,1D, 4L,1D (wall), so can't go further. This path is blocked.

Alternatively, go down from 2L,5D to the `ball`'s area. But the `ball` is at 7R,3D, which is southeast of Baba. So moving southeast:

1. Move down from 2L,5D to 2L,6D.
2. Right to 3L,6D.
3. Right to 4L,6D.
4. Right to 5L,6D.
5. Continue right until reaching 7L,6D (assuming L is left, R is right).
6. Then move up to 7L,5D, 7L,4D, 7L,3D (where the `ball` is).

But this path might be blocked by walls. The wall at 4R,3D is at 4 steps right, 3 steps down. So from Baba's position moving right and down, there's a wall at 4R,3D. So reaching the `ball` would require navigating around that.

This is getting too involved. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the `is` rule to the `win` position and then add a `you` to make ""win is you"". But how?

Here's a possible sequence:

1. Move left to grab the `is` rule at 1L,1U.
2. Move the `is` rule to the `win` position at 8R,1U.
3. Move the `you` rule from 5D to 8R,1U beside the `is` to create ""win is you","

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I should check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But how do I get there? There are walls at 4 steps to the right, and some ""stop"" rules which are immovable. Right now, I'm probably at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So, my current position is somewhere in the lower left part of the map.

The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, same as the ""baba"" rule. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The main obstacles are walls and stop blocks. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, but I don't know if that's useful yet. The ball is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe manipulating the ball could help, but how?

I need to find a path to the win area. Let's see the layout:

- Upwards, there's a rule ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up, then a ball and a wall. The win is to the right of that. But moving up might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, moving right might be better, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So maybe I can move past that by pushing something or changing rules.

Wait, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push objects that aren't tagged as STOP. But the walls are tagged as WALL, which might be STOP? Let me check the active rules. The initial rule is ""baba is you,"" but there's also ""wall is wall"" probably from another rule. Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ""rule wall"" at 2 steps left. So ""wall is wall"" is a rule, making walls immovable unless changed.

But how to get past them? Maybe I can redefine what a wall is. For example, if I can move the ""wall"" text block and change its property. For instance, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become movable and I can push them. But to do that, I need to find the ""wall"" rule and move it.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""wall"" at 2 steps to the left (probably at the starting position). Also, there's a rule ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. Maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule somewhere else. Let me see where I am. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So to get to the ""wall"" rule at 2 steps left (maybe same row?), I can move left. But wait, moving left from my current position would be 2 left and 5 down, but the ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left, which might be in the same row. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I need to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule to connect with ""wall"" and change its property. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become movable. Then I could push them out of the way.

But how to do that? To move a text block, it must not be STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So if I can avoid that area, I can move other blocks. Let me think about my path.

From my current position (baba at 2 left, 5 down), I can move up, down, left, or right. Let's see:

- Moving left would take me to 3 left, 5 down. Are there any STOPs there? The STOP is at 2 right and 2 down, so not in the way. So moving left might be possible.

- Moving right would take me to 1 left, 5 down. There's a wall at 3 right, but that's further right. Maybe moving right once is possible.

- Moving up from 5 down to 4 down. There's a wall at 3 right and 4 down. So if I move up, then right, but the wall is at 3 right, which is beyond my current position. Wait, my current position is 2 left and 5 down. So moving right would be towards positive direction. Let me clarify the coordinate system. Assuming that ""up"" and ""left"" are negative directions, and ""right"" and ""down"" are positive. So positions are relative.

Alternatively, maybe the map is a grid where each step is in a direction. The exact positions might not be critical as long as I can navigate to the relevant text blocks.

The key idea is to reach the ""wall"" rule (at 2 step left) and the ""is"" rule (at 1 left, 1 up) to rewrite ""wall is wall"" to ""wall is you"" or something else. Once that's done, walls become movable, and I can push them out of the path.

So the plan is:

1. Move from current position (baba) to the ""wall"" rule at 2 step left.
2. Move the ""wall"" rule to combine with an ""is"" rule to change its property.
3. Then navigate to the ""win"" area.

But how to get to the ""wall"" rule. Let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` at 2 left, 5 down.

""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. So if I move left once, I reach 3 left, 5 down. Then, maybe move up to reach the ""wall"" rule? Wait, the ""wall"" rule's position is 2 step to the left, which might be in the same row as the starting point. Maybe I need to move up to get to the same horizontal level.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""wall"" rule is in a different row. This is getting complicated without a visual map, but I'll try to logic through it.

Another approach: The ""win"" is at 8 right, 1 up. There's a door at 7 right, 2 down. Maybe using the door requires pushing the ball into it? Or maybe the ball is a key.

Alternatively, if I can change ""win"" to something else, like ""baba is win,"" then touching anything would win. But that requires manipulating the ""win"" rule.

But let's focus on the immediate goal. To reach the ""win"" at 8 right, 1 up, there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. If I can make that wall movable, I can push it aside. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is wall"" rule to something else.

The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left. So I need to move that ""wall"" rule somewhere. Let's say I move it to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. Then combine them to make ""wall is [something else]"".

To move the ""wall"" rule, I have to be adjacent to it. My current position is 2 left, 5 down. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left, so perhaps that's in the same row but leftwards. If I move left once, I reach 3 left, 5 down. Then, if the ""wall"" rule is at 2 left, maybe moving up from there to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe the ""wall"" rule is in the same vertical line. This is tricky. Let's assume that moving left from my current position gets me to the ""wall"" rule's location. Then I can pick it up and move it to the ""is"" rule.

Once I have the ""wall"" rule and an ""is"" rule adjacent, I can place them together to create a new rule, like ""wall is you"". Then walls become movable, and I can push them out of the way.

So step-by-step:

1. Move from baba's position (2 left, 5 down) to the ""wall"" rule at 2 left. Assuming moving left once gets me there.
2. Pick up the ""wall"" rule (since it's not STOP).
3. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up.
4. Place the ""wall"" rule next to the ""is"" rule to form ""wall is you"".
5. Then, navigate to the wall at 4 right, 1 up, push it aside, and proceed to the ""win"" at 8 right, 1 up.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching anything would win. But that might be quicker.

To make ""baba is win"", I need to find the ""win"" rule and combine it with a ""baba"" and ""is"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 1 up. So I need to get there, but there's a wall blocking the way. If I can make the wall movable, then push it. But that requires changing the wall's rule first.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""is"".

But this seems more complex. Let's try the first approach of changing ""wall"" to ""you"".

So, moving to the ""wall"" rule. From my current position:

Current position: 2 left, 5 down.

""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. Assuming that's in the same vertical line, moving left once gets me there. So action: left.

Once there, pick up the ""wall"" rule and move it to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. So need to move up and left.

But maybe after moving left to the ""wall"" rule, I need to move up to reach the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, the ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. So from the ""wall"" rule at 2 left, moving left again to 3 left, then up to 1 up. Hmm, not sure.

This is getting too vague without a visual. Maybe I should try moving left first to get to the ""wall"" rule, then see.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. However, moving directly there might be blocked by walls. Let me check the objects around me. I see a ""rule `is`"" to my left and up. Maybe I can move that rule somewhere else to change the rules.

Wait, the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that ball, maybe I can use it to interact with other rules. But how? The ""win"" is a rule, so perhaps if I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move it next to the ""win"" rule, I could create ""ball is win"". Let me see: the ""is"" rule is 1 step up from me, and the ""win"" is 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I move up to the ""is"" rule, take it, and then move right to where the ""win"" is, I can place ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""ball"" to form ""ball is win"".

But wait, am I allowed to move the ""is"" rule? Since the only active rule is ""baba is you"", I can move anything that's not a ""stop"" or similar. The ""is"" rule isn't a stop, so I can pick it up. Let's plan the steps:

1. Move up once to reach the ""is"" rule that's 1 step up.
2. Grab the ""is"" rule.
3. Move right 7 steps to get to the ""win"" rule's position (since ""win"" is 9 steps right from the starting point, but moving from the ""is"" position which is 1 step up, so right 8 steps to get to the same horizontal as ""win"", which is at 9 steps right. Wait, maybe I need to calculate the exact steps. Let's see: original position of the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. The ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 1 step up. So from the ""is"" rule's position, moving right 8 steps would reach the ""win"" rule's location. Then place the ""is"" there next to ""win"".

But after placing ""is"", the rule becomes ""win is [something]"". Wait, no. The existing ""win"" rule is ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right..."", so to make ""ball is win"", I need to have ""ball"" adjacent to ""is"" and ""win"".

So maybe after placing the ""is"" next to ""win"", I need to move to the ""ball"" and place another ""is"" next to it and ""win"". But the ""is"" rule I moved is already used. Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can create ""ball is win"" by having the text blocks arranged as ""ball is win"". The existing ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule between them, but that might not be possible because of the walls.

Looking at the map, there are walls at 4 steps right and various positions. Let me check the path. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point near the ""is"" rule 1 step up), moving right towards the ""win"" would require passing through walls at 4 steps right. So that's blocked. Therefore, I can't go directly right.

Alternative approach: Use the ball to carry the ""is"" rule. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move the ball by pushing it if it's adjacent. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from me. If I move right, I can push the ball further right. But the walls at 4 steps right might block that. Let's see:

If I move right towards the ball, I can push it. Let's say I move right once, pushing the ball to 2 steps right and 1 step up. Then continue moving right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So maybe I can push the ball up to avoid the wall? The ball is 1 step up and 1 step right. If I move up while pushing the ball, but the ball's up position is already occupied by the ""win"" rule? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step up could be useful. If I can get there, but again, walls at 4 steps right block the path.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" and ""ball"", that would help. But again, path is blocked by walls.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe change the ""win"" rule to something else. For example, make ""baba is win"", so touching myself would win. But to do that, I need to edit the ""win"" rule. The current ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""is"" rule there next to ""win"" and ""baba"", but where is Baba located? There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. That's quite far.

Alternatively, use the existing ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down. If I can make ""baba is win"", then since I'm you (because ""baba is you""), touching win would work. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- I'm Baba, so ""baba is you"" means I can move and manipulate rules.
- The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, but it's blocked by walls.
- To bypass this, I need to create a new rule that makes touching something else count as winning.

Possible solution: Create ""ball is win"". Then move to the ball and touch it to win.

To do that, I need to arrange the text blocks ""ball"", ""is"", ""win"" adjacent to each other.

The existing ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. The ""is"" rules are at 1 step up (near me) and 8 steps right and 1 step up.

If I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps right to between the ball and win, but the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right.

Alternative idea: Use the ""is"" rule that's already at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ball and then next to the win.

From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point where the ""is"" rule is 1 step up), moving up would take me to that ""is"" rule. Then take it, move right to the ball (1 step right), place ""is"" there, then move right again to the win (but there's a wall at 4 steps right). So that's not possible.

Wait, the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move right from the ""is"" rule, I reach the ball. Place the ""is"" next to the ball, making ""ball is [something]"". Then need another ""is"" next to ""win"" to complete ""ball is win"". But the other ""is"" is at 8 steps right, which is far away.

Alternatively, maybe create ""win is ball"", but that wouldn't help.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: Make ""door is win"". Then go through the door. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. But to get there, I need to navigate through walls.

Alternatively, since there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which makes that area immovable.

This is tricky. Maybe focus on moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" and ""ball"".

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. The ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The distance between them is 8 steps right. If I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps right to between them, but again, path blocked.

Alternative idea: Use the existing ""is"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" down to where the ball and win are. But the path down is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, etc.

Perhaps I need to find a different rule to manipulate. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win area would work. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, make ""you is win"". Since I'm you, touching win would make me win. But ""you"" is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. The ""win"" is up at 9 steps right. So need to move ""is"" between ""you"" and ""win"". But again, path is blocked.

This level seems really challenging. Maybe I need to push the ball past the walls. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move right, pushing the ball each time until it's near the win area. But the walls at 4 steps right would block that. Let's see:

Starting from the ball's position (1 right, 1 up), if I move right, pushing the ball to 2 right, 1 up. Then again right to 3 right, 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So can't go further. So the ball can only get to 3 right, 1 up.

Then, if I create a rule ""ball is win"" at that position, but I need to place the ""is"" rule next to ball and win. The win is at 9 right, so that's not nearby.

Alternative plan: Use the door. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then going through the door would win. To do that, need to place ""is"" next to door and win.

The win is at 9 right, 1 up. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. So placing ""is"" between door and win would require moving diagonally, which isn't allowed. Only up, down, left, right.

Hmm. This is really confusing. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Since the initial rule is ""baba is you"", and I can move anything not stopped, perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule somewhere else. But the win rule is a property, not an object I can move. Wait, no, the rules are objects. So the ""rule `win`"" is an object that can be moved, as long as it's not stopped.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move it closer, but again, walls block the path.

Another idea: Make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. That's a huge distance. Not practical.

Wait, maybe there's a shorter path. If I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 1 up down to where the ""baba"" rule is. From 8 right, 1 up, moving down 3 steps would get to 5 down, which is where the ""is"" and ""you"" rules are. Then place ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But the ""win"" is still far away.

This is really tough. Maybe I need to focus on the immediate area. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from me. If I take that, move right to the ball, place ""is"" there, making ""ball is [something]"". Then take another ""is"" from 8 right, 1 up, move left to the win, place ""is"" there, making ""win is [something]"". But then how does ""ball is win"" come into play?

Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is you"", then touching the ball would make me win. But I'm already you, so that might work. To do that, arrange ""ball is you"".

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down. The ball is at 1 right, 1 up. So need to move ""is"" between them. But the distance is 4 down. So moving the ""is"" rule from 8 right, 1 up down to 5 down, placing it next to ""you"" and ""ball"". But that's a lot of steps.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a simpler approach. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", I can move freely. The goal is to reach the win area. The win is at 9 right, 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So I can't go straight right.

But what if I use the ball to break the wall? No, the ball is a normal object. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing walls, but the only rule is ""baba is you"".

Wait, maybe push the stop rule? There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 2 down. If I can move it away, but I don't have a ""push"" action; I can only move objects if I'm adjacent and they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule makes its tile immovable, so I can't move anything on that tile.

Another idea: Use the door. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then going through the door would win. To do that, I need to place ""is"" next to door and win. The win is at 9 right, 1 up. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. So placing ""is"" between them isn't possible in a straight line.

Alternatively, make ""baba is door"", then go through the door. But how? The door is at 8 right, 2 down. To make ""baba is door"", I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""door"". The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. That's a distance of 9 right and 3 down. Not feasible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different way. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down. If I can make ""you is win"", then since I'm you, touching win would work. To do that, arrange ""you is win"". The ""you"" is at 1 right,5 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. So need to move ""is"" between them. But the distance is too great.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to use the existing ""is"" rules. There are two ""is"" rules: one at 1 step up and another at 8 right, 1 up. If I take the one at 8 right,1 up, move it down to 5 down, placing it next to ""you"" and ""win"". But how?

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule from 1 step up to the ball, making ""ball is [something]"". Then take the other ""is"" and place it next to ""win"" and whatever, to form ""win is [something]"". But without knowing what to make them, it's hard.

Alternatively, make ""win is stop"" so that the win area is not a stop, but I can't win by touching it. That doesn't help.

Wait, maybe the key is to realize that ""baba"" is you, and if you can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win area would work. So how to do that? The ""win"" rule is at 9 right,1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,5 down. Need to move ""is"" between them. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the ball as a mover. If I can push the ball to the win area, but the walls block that.

I think I'm missing something obvious. Let me look at the initial setup again. The active rule is ""baba is you"". The win is at 9 right,1 up. The ball is at 1 right,1 up. There's a rule ""is"" at 1 step up (near me) and another at 8 right,1 up.

If I take the ""is"" from 1 step up, move right to the ball (1 step right), place ""is"" there, making ""ball is [something]"". Then take the other ""is"" from 8 right,1 up, move left to the win area (but need to navigate around walls). For example, move left from 8 right,1 up to 7 right,1 up, then down to 7 right,2 up, etc., until reaching the win area. But there's a wall at 4 right, so this path is blocked.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from 8 right,1 up down to 5 down, placing it next to the ""you"" rule. Then create ""you is win"", making me win by touching win. But again, the distance is too great.

Maybe the solution is to push the ball towards the win area. The ball is at 1 right,1 up. If I move right, pushing the ball to 2 right,1 up. Then again to 3 right,1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right,1 up. So the ball can only get to 3 right,1 up. Then, place an ""is"" rule there next to the ball and win. But the win is at 9 right, so that's not adjacent.

This is frustrating. I think I need to try a different approach. Since I can move any non-stop object, maybe I can move the ""win","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which in this case is 9 steps to the right and up. However, there are walls and other obstacles in the way.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to change some rules. If I can get to the ""win"" block, but there's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Do I need a key or something? Wait, there's a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe ""ball"" is a key? But how do I get to it?

The walls are 4 steps to the right in various positions, and there's a ""stop"" block at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Since ""stop"" makes things immovable, I can't push past that. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to override the stop property. 

The ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step up could be moved to create a new rule. For example, if I take that rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" maybe I can make ""baba is win"" or ""you is win."" But how do I move the rule block? I need to check if I can move left or right. 

The current position of Baba isn't explicitly stated, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. If I move up, I can grab that rule block. Then, move right towards the ""win"" block. But there's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, the wall is 4 steps right and 1 step up from where? Maybe I need to navigate around it. 

Alternatively, if I can create a rule like ""wall is stop"" or something, but I don't see a way to change that. The key might be to use the existing ""rule `is`"" to make Baba equivalent to another object. For instance, if I make ""baba is door,"" then stepping on the door would make me the door, which might be the win condition. 

But how to do that? Let's say I move the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""baba"" and ""door."" Then, placing ""baba is door"" would make me a door, and if the win condition is a door, that could work. But I need to navigate to those positions without hitting the stop blocks. 

The stop block is at 3 right and 2 down. So if I go down there, I can't move past it. Maybe I have to go around it. Let's map out the path. From the initial position, moving up gets me to the ""rule `is`"" block. Then moving right towards the win block, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. So I can't go straight right. Maybe move up again? 

Alternatively, moving left from the initial position to get around the wall. But the ""wall"" is 1 step to the left, so maybe that's near the starting point. If I move left, I might hit that wall. Hmm. 

Another approach: If I can make ""you is win,"" then since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" that would make me win. So creating the rule ""you is win"" by moving the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""you"" and ""win."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. The ""win"" is 9 steps right and up. That's far away. Maybe I need to first gather the necessary blocks. 

Alternatively, pick up the ""rule `is`"" block and move it to where ""baba"" and ""win"" are located. For example, if I move the ""is"" block to the position of ""baba"" (which is 1 step left and 5 steps down) and ""win"" (9 steps right and up), placing ""baba is win"" would make reaching the win block count as winning. But getting there is the challenge. 

The main obstacles are the walls and the stop block. Maybe I need to use the ball? If the ball is a movable object, perhaps I can push it, but since nothing is defined as-pushable except when rules allow. Since ""baba is you,"" and if ""ball"" is a movable object, maybe I can use it to break through a stop block? Not sure. 

Wait, the ""stop"" block prevents movement, but if I can make ""stop"" something else, like ""stop is nothing,"" then it wouldn't block. But there's no rule to do that. The existing rules are ""baba is you,"" and various ""rule [X] is [Y]"" placements. 

So the immediate goal is to either reach the win block directly or change the rules to make reaching it possible. To change the rules, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" blocks. The one 1 step up is closest. If I move up to grab it, then I can create a new rule. 

Let's say I move up (to the ""rule `is`"" block), take it, then move right towards the ""win"" block. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe after getting the ""is"" rule, I go down to avoid the wall. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the position of ""baba"" and ""you"" to make ""you is win."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. So I need to navigate to that area. 

But the path is blocked by walls and the stop block. Maybe I need to go around. If I move left from the initial position, there's a wall 1 step to the left, so that's not helpful. Moving down from the initial position, there's a wall 4 steps right and 1 step down. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" Let's see: starting position, move up to get the ""is"" rule. Then move right, avoiding the walls. But how?

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" that's 1 step left and 5 steps down. So, I need to move down 5 steps and left 1 step, then place the ""is"" rule next to it and ""win."" But that's a long way. 

Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" So I'm Baba, and I can move. My goal is to reach the win block or change the rules to make me win. 

Another idea: If I can make ""win is you,"" then since I'm you, that would work. But how to create that rule. There's a ""rule `win`"" block at 9 steps right and up. Maybe I can move that? But the ""win"" block is an object, not a rule. Rules are the ones with ""is."" 

Wait, the ""rule `win`"" is a text block that says ""WIN IS YOU"" or something? No, the observation says ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up."" So it's a rule block that defines ""WIN"" as something. But the active rules only show ""baba is you."" 

So the existing rules are:

- baba is you

And the other rule blocks are positions of text like ""is,"" ""win,"" etc., but their actual rules are not active unless placed properly. 

Ah, right. The active rules are the ones formed by the text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So in the current observation, the only active rule is ""baba is you"" because that's the only one that matches the format. The other rule blocks are just placed on the map but haven't been used to create active rules yet. 

So to create a new active rule, I need to move a ""rule [X]"" block next to a subject and property. For example, if I move the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win,"" making me win. 

So the plan is: 

1. Move to the ""rule `is`"" block that's 1 step up.
2. Carry it down to where ""baba"" is located (1 step left and 5 steps down).
3. Place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" so that the new rule is ""baba is win.""
4. Then, move to the ""win"" block at 9 steps right and up, which would now make me win.

But navigating there is tricky because of the walls and stop blocks. Let's see the layout:

- Starting position: Assume I'm at the initial position where the first ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up. So maybe my position is at (0,0), and the ""rule `is`"" is at (0,1).

- Ball is at (1,1), wall at (4,1).

- To get to the ""baba"" that's 1 step left and 5 steps down (which is at (-1, -5)), I need to move left and down, but there are walls blocking the way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. If I move up to grab the ""rule `is`"" block at (0,1), then move right towards the ""win"" block at (9,1). But there's a wall at (4,1), so I can't go straight right. Maybe move down from (0,1) to (0,0), then right to (4,0), but there's a wall at (4,0). Hmm.

Alternatively, move the ""rule `is`"" block to the ""win"" block's location. The ""win"" is at (9,1). So I need to carry the ""is"" block from (0,1) to (9,1), but there are walls at (4,1) and others. This seems impossible because of the walls blocking the path.

Another approach: Use the ""ball"" somehow. If I can move the ball to unlock the door. The door is at (7,2). If the ball is a key, maybe placing it on the door would open it. But how to do that? The ball is at (7,3), so I need to move it up to (7,2), which is the door's position. But to get there, I have to navigate past the stop block at (3,2). 

To move the ball, I need to be able to push it, but the rules don't say I can push anything yet. Unless ""baba is you"" and ""ball is [pushable],"" but by default, only objects defined as movable can be pushed. Since nothing is defined as movable except via a rule, and the only rule is ""baba is you,"" which doesn't grant pushing abilities, I can't push the ball. 

So maybe the solution is to create a rule that allows pushing. For example, ""baba is push"" or ""ball is push."" But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the subject and property. 

Alternatively, make ""push is you,"" so that anything defined as push is you, allowing you to push them. But this is getting complicated. 

Let me recap. The key is to either reach the win block or redefine the win condition. The closest win block is at (9,1), but it's blocked by walls. The other win rule is part of the text block at (9,1), but without an active rule saying ""baba is win,"" touching it won't help. 

So the best bet is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" in question is the one at (-1, -5), which is far away. To get there, I need to move left and down, but there are walls. 

Alternatively, is there another ""baba"" nearby? The observation shows ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down,"" which is the text block, not an active ""baba is you"" rule. The active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so the other ""baba"" text block is just a label. 

Wait, maybe the ""baba"" that's part of the rule is at (1 step left, 5 steps down), but I'm not sure where I am. This is getting confusing without a visual map. 

Alternatively, focus on the immediate objects. The ""rule `is`"" block is 1 step up. If I move up there, grab it, then move right towards the ""win"" block at (9,1). But there's a wall at (4,1). So maybe I need to go around it by moving down to (4,0), but there's a wall there too. 

Alternatively, move down from the initial position to (0,-1), then right to (4,-1), but again, walls. 

This seems stuck. Maybe the solution is to create a rule that makes the stop block passable. For example, ""stop is nothing."" To do that, I need to move a ""rule `is`"" block next to ""stop"" and ""nothing."" But there's no ""nothing"" object on the map. 

Alternatively, ""stop is you,"" making the stop block part of me, so I can move through it. But I would need to create the rule ""stop is you."" To do that, move the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""stop"" and ""you."" The ""you"" is at (1 step right, 5 steps down). The ""stop"" is at (3 right, 2 down). So I need to navigate to (3,2), place the ""is"" block there, then make ""stop is you."" 

But getting to (3,2) is possible? From the initial position (assuming it's at (0,0)), moving right to (3,0), but there's a wall at (4,0), so can't go further right. Move down to (3,-1), then right to (3,0), but wall again. This is tricky. 

Maybe another angle: Use the ""ball"" to create a rule. If I can move the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" making ""ball is win."" Then, pushing the ball to the win block would make it win. But again, I can't push the ball unless I have a rule allowing it. 

Alternatively, make ""baba is ball,"" so I become the ball, and then push it to the win block. But to do that, I need to create ""baba is ball"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""ball."" The ""ball"" is at (1,1). So from the initial position (0,0), move up to (0,1) to get the ""is"" rule, then move right to (1,1) to place the rule. That would make ""baba is ball,"" and then I could push the ball. 

But can I push the ball? If ""baba is ball,"" and nothing says I can push, then no. Unless ""ball"" has a push property, which it doesn't. 

Hmm. This is quite challenging. Let me try to outline possible steps again:

1. Move up to grab the ""rule `is`"" block at (0,1).
2. Move right to (1,1) where the ball is, placing ""baba is ball"" to become the ball.
3. Now, if I can push the ball, move it towards the win block. But I don't know if being the ball allows pushing.
4. Alternatively, place the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" at (9,1), making ""baba is win."" But pathing there is blocked.

Another thought: The ""door"" at (7,2) might be unlocked if I have the ball. If I can get the ball to the door, maybe that opens it. But how? The door is a ""rule `door`"" block, which might require a specific rule to interact with. 

Alternatively, make ""door is you,"" so stepping on the door makes me win. But to do that, need to create ""door is you"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""you."" The ""you"" is at (1,5), and the ""door"" is at (7,2). That's a distance, but maybe possible. 

Let me try to visualize the path:

From initial position (assuming (0,0)):

- Up to (0,1) to get ""rule `is`.
- Down to (0,0).
- Right to (4,0) but wall there.
- Down to (0,-1).
- Right to (4,-1) wall.
- This isn't working. Maybe another route.

Alternatively, from (0,1) after grabbing the ""is"" rule:

- Move right to (4,1) (but there's a wall), so can't.
- Move down to (0,0).
- Left to (-1,0) where there's a wall 1 step to the left. So can't go further left.
- This is frustrating. 

Maybe the solution is to go down to the ""baba"" at (-1, -5) and create a rule there. But how to get there? 

Alternatively, use the ""rule `is`"" block at 8 steps right and 1 step up. That's another ""is"" rule. If I can move that one to create a rule near the win block. 

But the ""rule `is`"" at (8,1) is far away. To get there, from (0,0):

- Up to (0,1).
- Right to (8,1), but walls at (4,1) block the path. So can't go straight right. 

This seems impossible. Maybe the level requires a different approach. 

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at (1 step right, 5 steps down). If I can make ""you is win,"" then since I'm you, that would work. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block next to ""you"" and ""win."" 

The ""you"" is at (1,5), and ""win"" is at (9,1). So the path from (1,5) to (9,1) is down and right. But there are walls and a stop block. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule from (0,","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let's start by understanding the current state. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I control Baba. My goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right and up. But there are walls and other obstacles in the way.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to change some rules. The ""win"" is blocked by a wall and a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" makes the wall immovable. So I need a way to get past that. 

The ball is near the ""win"" area. If I can manipulate the rules to make the ball a ""win"" instead, then stepping on it would solve the level. Alternatively, maybe I can become the ""door"" to go through it, but the door is at 8 steps right and 2 down, which is a bit further. 

Another thought: if I can make ""wall"" something else, like ""push"" or ""stop,"" but right now the rules are set to ""baba is you,"" and other rules are fixed. There's a ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step up. If I move that to connect ""baba"" with another property, maybe I can change what I am. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""you"" to make ""baba is you,"" which I already have. Not helpful. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 5 steps down to the right. If I can get to that and combine it with ""baba,"" maybe I can make ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. Alternatively, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. Let's see where the ""is"" blocks are. There's one at 1 step up and another at 8 steps right and 1 up. 

If I move the ""is"" block from 1 step up to be next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" then creating ""ball is win"" would change the win condition. But how do I move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move unless there's a ""stop"" rule. The walls are 4 steps right and 1 up, which are ""wall"" objects. So moving towards them would hit a wall. 

The ""stop"" block is at 3 steps right and 2 down. If I go that direction, I can't move past it. The ""door"" is at 8 right and 2 down. Maybe pushing the door if I have a ""push"" rule, but I don't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to push the door. If the ball is movable, I can move it towards the door. But the ball's current rule isn't specified. Wait, the active rules only have ""baba is you."" So the ball might be a normal object, movable unless stopped. Let me check the objects again. 

The objects list includes ""ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" There's no rule defining the ball's properties except possibly if there's a ""ball is..."" rule. Looking at the active rules, there's ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right..."" and ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left,"" etc. So the ball isn't defined by any specific rule except being an object. Since I can move it (as I'm you), maybe I can move the ball towards the door or the win area. 

But the ""win"" is blocked by a wall and a stop. If I could make the wall not a stop, that would help. For example, if I change ""wall is stop"" to something else. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step left. There's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left,"" which probably means ""wall is [something]."" Wait, the objects list has ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left,"" which is a text block saying ""WALL IS ..."" but what's after? The active rules don't show ""wall is stop"" in the current active rules. Wait, the active rules listed are ""baba is you,"" and the objects include ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left,"" which might be a text block that's not currently active. 

Wait, the active rules are the ones that are parsed from the text blocks. So the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block that says ""WALL IS ..."" but we need to see what property it's assigning. Since the active rules listed are only ""baba is you,"" that means the other text blocks aren't active. Maybe they're covered by walls or something. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize the map. Baba is at the starting position. There's a rule `is` above, which I can move. If I move that up, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" making ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. 

But how to get to that position? The current position of the ""is"" block is 1 step up. If I move up again, but where am I? The initial position isn't specified, but the first observation had Baba possibly at a starting point. Let's assume I need to move the ""is"" block to the ball and win area. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to Baba and the win object. But the win is 9 steps right and up, which is far away. There are walls blocking the path. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can push the walls if there's a ""push"" rule, but there isn't one active. The ""stop"" rule prevents movement through it. 

Wait, the ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" is present. If I can become the door, then stepping on it would let me pass. To do that, I need to create a rule ""baba is door."" But how? There's a ""rule `is`"" block that I can move. If I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""door,"" that would create ""baba is door,"" making me a door. Then, since doors are usually passable, I could go through the door. 

But where is the ""door"" object located? It's at 8 right and 2 down. To get there, I need to navigate past walls and the stop block. Let's see the path. From the initial position, moving right 4 steps gets to the first wall. Then there's another wall 1 step down, and a stop block at 3 right and 2 down. So moving right directly is blocked. 

Maybe moving up first, then right. The initial ""is"" block is 1 step up. If I move up, then perhaps I can rearrange the rules. But each action is a single step. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push the door. If the ball is movable, I can move it towards the door, but the door is at 8 right and 2 down, and the ball is at 1 right and 1 up. It's a long way. 

Another idea: The ""rule `you`"" is at 5 steps down to the right. If I can get to that and combine it with ""baba"" using the ""is"" block, I could make ""baba is you,"" but that's already the case. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm controlling Baba. The key is to reach the win object. Since the win is blocked by a wall and stop, I need to either remove the stop, make the wall passable, or change the win condition. 

Changing the win condition to the ball would be ideal. To do that, I need to create ""ball is win"" using the ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to the ball and the win object. 

The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The win is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So between the ball and the win, there's a wall. To get to the win, I need to move past that wall, but it's blocked by a stop. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ball's position and the win's position. But how? Let's think about movement. 

If I'm at the starting position (assuming), and the ""is"" block is 1 step up. If I move up, I can get to the ""is"" block. Then, move the ""is"" block to the right to reach the ball and win area. But there are walls in the way. 

The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is a problem. To move past it, I need to either remove the wall's ""stop"" property or move the wall. But since I can't push walls unless there's a push rule, and there isn't one, I'm stuck. 

Wait, but maybe I can change the wall's property. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block that says ""WALL IS ..."" but what's after? If I can move that text block to reassign the wall's property. For example, moving it to say ""WALL IS PUSH"" so I can push walls. But that requires accessing that text block, which is 1 step to the left of the starting position. 

If I move left, there's a wall at 1 step to the left (rule `wall` 1 step to the left). So moving left would hit that wall. Unless I can change the wall's property to not be a stop. 

This is getting really complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""is"" block to reassign rules.
   - Current ""is"" block is 1 step up. Move up to get to it.
   - Then, move right to reach the ball or win area.

2. Create ""ball is win"" by placing ""is"" between ball and win.
   - But need to navigate past walls and stop block.

3. Alternatively, create ""baba is door"" to become a door and pass through the door object.

4. Or, make ""stop is nothing"" to remove the stop property from the wall.

Let's try option 3: Become a door. To do that, create ""baba is door"". There's a door object at 8 right, 2 down. The ""rule `is`"" block is at 1 step up. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to Baba and the door. 

But how to reach the door's position? The path is blocked by walls and a stop. Maybe move up, then right, but the walls are in the way. Alternatively, use the ball to push the door, but the ball is far away. 

Alternatively, push the wall aside by changing its property. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"", then I could potentially push the wall. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step left, which is a text block. To access it, I need to move left, but there's a wall there. 

Wait, the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block. If I can move that text block, I could change the wall's property. For example, moving it to say ""WALL IS PUSH"" by rearranging the text. But that requires moving the text block, which is possible if it's not stopped. 

But the text block itself might be movable unless there's a stop rule on it. Since the active rules don't include a stop for text blocks, maybe I can move the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" block. 

If I move left from the starting position, I hit a wall. But the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block, not a wall object. Wait, no—the objects list includes ""wall 1 step to the left"" and ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"". So the wall is a separate object, and the text block is a rule. 

So moving left would hit the wall object, which is a ""stop"" because of the ""wall is stop"" rule (if that's active). But in the current active rules, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". So the ""wall is stop"" might not be active because the corresponding text block is covered or not parsed. 

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to focus. The key is to manipulate the ""is"" blocks to create a new rule that allows me to reach the win. 

The most straightforward way is to make the ball the win. So create ""ball is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 1 step up to be between ball and win. 

The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The win is at 9 right and 1 up. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up, which is above the ball. So if I move the ""is"" block to the right, past the wall, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block up, then right. But how? Each move is a single step. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the ball's position. The ""is"" is 1 step up from the ball. If I move down from the ""is"" block to the ball's position, but the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from its current position. Wait, the ball's position is relative to where? 

Assuming the starting position is (0,0), then:

- rule `is` is at (0, 1)
- ball is at (1, 1)
- wall at (4,1)
- rule `is` at (8,1)
- win at (9,1)

So to get to the ball, I need to move right from the ""is"" block at (0,1) to (1,1), which is where the ball is. But between (0,1) and (1,1), is there anything? The ball is there. Since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can move onto the ball. 

Once on the ball, I can pick up the ""is"" block and move it. Wait, can I move text blocks while on them? In Baba Is You, you can move over text blocks unless they're stopped. Since the ball isn't stopped, I can move onto it and then move the ""is"" block. 

So the steps could be:

1. Move up from the starting position to reach the ""is"" block at (0,1).
2. Move right to (1,1), which is the ball.
3. Now, the ""is"" block is at (0,1), but I'm on (1,1). Maybe pick up the ""is"" block and move it.
4. Move the ""is"" block to the right, past the wall at (4,1). But the wall is there, and it's a stop. Unless I can change the wall's property.

Alternatively, after getting the ""is"" block, move it to the ball and win positions. 

But the wall at (4,1) is a problem. To move past it, I need to either remove its stop property or move it. Since I can't push it without a push rule, maybe changing it. 

The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block at (-1,0). So to access it, I need to move left from the starting position, but there's a wall at (0,-1) according to the objects list? Wait, the objects include ""wall 1 step to the left"", which would be at (-1,0). So moving left from the starting position (assuming it's at (0,0)) would take me to (-1,0), which is a wall. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to Baba and the win object. The win is at (9,1). To get there, I need to move right 9 steps, but there are walls blocking the path. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push the win object, but the win is a rule, not a movable object. 

Wait, the ""win"" is a text block at (9,1). If I can make the ball into a win, then touching the ball would make me win. So creating ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" block to (8,1) which is the other ""is"" block, then moving it to the ball's position. 

The other ""is"" block is at (8,1). If I move that ""is"" block to the right to be next to the ball at (1,1), that's not possible because they're far apart. 

This is really frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently. Since I'm Baba and can move unless stopped, and there's a rule `is` nearby, maybe I can create a rule that makes me a door. For example, create ""baba is door"" which would let me pass through walls. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""door"". The door is at (8,2). So the steps would be:

1. Move from starting position to the ""is"" block at (0,1).
2. Move down to (0,0), then right to reach the door's area. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at (8,1) which is next to the door's rule. If I can move that ""is"" block up to be next to Baba and the door. 

Baba's rule is at (1 step to the left and 5 steps down) according to the objects list. Wait, no—the objects list has ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"", which is a text block saying ""BABA IS ..."" but what's after? If it's ""BABA IS YOU"", then that's the active rule. 

This level seems really complex. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block from (8,1) to be next to the door and Baba. 

For example, if the ""is"" block at (8,1) is moved down to (8,0), then place it between Baba and the door. But I'm not sure where Baba is located.

Let's try to figure out what I need to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move wherever I go, right? My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Hmm. Maybe I need to interact with those? 

Wait, the ""win"" is a rule, so if I can move to that spot, does that make me the win? Since ""baba is you,"" moving to the ""win"" rule might work. But the path there is blocked by walls and a ""stop"" block. The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is one obstacle. Also, the ""stop"" block at 3 steps right and 2 steps down might prevent me from moving further down. 

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule somewhere else, I could create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""ball,"" then making ""ball is win"" might make the ball the win condition. That could be a way to bypass the walls. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba, which is ""you,"" I can move myself and any text blocks that aren't ""stop"" or similar. The ""is"" rule at 1 step up is movable. If I move left from my current position (which seems to be at the original position of Baba, maybe the starting point), but I need to check my current location. 

Wait, the observation shows that there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So maybe I'm currently at that position? Or is that a separate object? I need to clarify my position. Assuming I'm at the ""rule `baba`"" location, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down, I need to figure out how to reach the ""win"" or manipulate the rules. 

Looking at the map layout, the ""win"" is far to the right and up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, blocking the direct path. The ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down might be a way through if I can push it or use it, but since I'm not sure about the rules for doors yet. 

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that makes ""door"" passable or ""stop"" non-stop, that might help. But right now, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" 

Another angle: The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" to be next to ""ball,"" then I can say ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win object. Then I just need to reach the ball. But moving the ""is"" rule requires me to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. 

My current position is 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from me. So if I move up once, I can grab the ""is"" rule. Then, I need to move it to the ball's location, which is 8 steps right and 3 steps down. But moving from my position (1 left, 5 down) to the ""is"" (1 step up) would put me at the same spot as the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move the ""is"" rule right and down accordingly. 

However, the path might be blocked. Between me and the ""is"" rule, is there anything? The wall at 1 step left is probably my position, and moving up would take me to the ""is"" rule. Then, moving right from there, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe I need to adjust the ""is"" rule to a different position where I can reach the ball without obstacles. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" location. If I make ""win is you"" or something, but I'm already ""you."" Maybe ""win is push"" or another property. Wait, the goal is to reach the win object, so if I can make myself a win, that would work. Since ""baba is you"" and ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and change its property to ""win."" So, if I move the ""is"" rule that's at 1 step up to be adjacent to ""baba"" (which is at 1 left, 5 down), but that seems a bit far. Let's see: my current position is 1 left, 5 down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up, so that's at my current x-coordinate, 1 step above. So if I move up, I can pick up the ""is"" rule. Then, move it left to reach the ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 5 down. Wait, but ""baba"" is a rule itself at 1 left, 5 down. So placing the ""is"" rule next to it would make ""baba is [property]."" 

If I can move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule, then I can change its property to ""win."" So the steps would be: move up to grab the ""is"" rule, then move left to the ""baba"" rule's position, place the ""is"" there, and then the rule becomes ""baba is win,"" making me the win. Then I just need to stay in place, and the game would be won. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule left? From the ""is"" position at 1 step up (same x as me, 1 up), moving left would take me to the ""wall"" at 1 step left. Wait, there's a wall at 1 step left. So I can't move left from the ""is"" rule's position because there's a wall. Therefore, I need to find another path. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule down to a different spot. If I move the ""is"" rule down from its current position (1 up), then maybe place it near the ""ball"" or another area. But the path down might be blocked by walls. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can push objects if they are pushable. But the active rules don't mention push, so maybe not. Alternatively, use the ""door"" if possible. 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move to that door and interact with it, but I don't know the rules for doors. Maybe ""door"" is passable unless there's a STOP. The ""stop"" is at 3 right, 2 down. So if I go through the door, maybe I can bypass some walls. 

But how to get to the door? From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up which is blocking the upper path. Let's map this out:

Starting position: 1 left, 5 down (Baba's rule).

Looking at the grid:

Up from here is the ""is"" rule. Moving up once gets me there.

From there, moving right towards the win at 9 right, 1 up, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So can't go that way.

Alternatively, moving down from the ""is"" rule would take me to 1 left, 2 down. But there's a ""stop"" at 3 right, 2 down. Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ball's location. The ball is at 8 right, 3 down. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls in the way. 

This seems tricky. Maybe the key is to change the ""win"" rule's position. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move that ""win"" rule closer, but it's protected by the ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 up. 

Alternatively, create a new ""win"" rule somewhere else. For example, move the ""is"" rule to be next to the ""ball,"" making ""ball is win."" Then go to the ball. 

So steps:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

2. Move the ""is"" rule right and down to reach the ball's location (8 right, 3 down).

But the path might be blocked. From the ""is"" rule's position (1 up), moving right 7 times would get to 8 right, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So I can't go through there. 

Alternative path: Move the ""is"" rule down and then right. From 1 up, move down to 1 down, then right. But there's a wall at 4 right, which is further right. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe another approach: since I'm ""you,"" and the ""win"" is a rule, if I can touch the ""win"" rule, I win. But the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up, blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, use the ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move to the door and perhaps push it or something. But without knowing the door's rules, it's hard. 

Wait, the ""door"" is a rule. Maybe ""door is push"" or ""door is move."" But the active rules only have ""baba is you."" So unless I change a rule, the door's behavior is default. 

Maybe I need to create a rule that makes doors passable. For example, ""door is you"" or ""door is move."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" and change its property. 

So, steps:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

2. Move right to the ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down.

But the path from the ""is"" rule (1 up) to the door (8 right, 2 down) is blocked by walls. Specifically, there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up, and others down. 

This seems impossible. Maybe the solution is to manipulate the ""you"" rule. Currently, ""you"" is at 1 right, 5 down. If I can make ""baba"" the ""you,"" but I already am ""you"" because ""baba is you."" 

Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you,"" so I am you. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down. Maybe I need to move that ""you"" rule to somewhere else, but why would that help? 

Alternatively, create a new ""you"" rule for another object, making that object also controllable. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. 

Another idea: The ""ball"" is at 8 right, 3 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and make it ""win,"" then the ball becomes the win condition. So:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

2. Move right 7 times to reach 8 right, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. Can't go through. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule down from its initial position. From 1 up, move down to 1 down, then right. But there's a wall at 4 right, which is beyond. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the answer is to simply move towards the ""win"" rule despite the walls, but since I can't push blocks, I can't go around. 

Wait, the ""stop"" block at 3 right, 2 down. If I can make ""stop"" not a stop, then I can move through it. To do that, I need to change the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is a text block, so if I can move it and rewrite it. 

For example, move the ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" block and change its property to something else, like ""push."" But again, the path is blocked. 

I'm stuck. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" rule's position to make ""baba is win."" Let's try that:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

2. Move left to reach the ""baba"" rule at 1 left, 5 down. But there's a wall at 1 step left. So I can't move left past the wall. 

Therefore, that's not possible. 

Alternative plan: Move the ""is"" rule to the ""you"" rule's position. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down. If I make ""you"" into something else, but I'm already ""you."" 

Hmm. Maybe the key is to realize that ""win"" is a rule, and if I can touch the ""win"" rule, I win. But it's blocked. So perhaps I need to push the wall in front of it. But there's no ""push"" rule. 

Wait, the ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 up. If I can change the ""wall"" rule to something else, like ""push,"" then maybe I can push it. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and change its property. 

So:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

2. Move right to the ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 up.

But there's a wall there, so I can't move right past it. Unless I'm pushing the wall, but I don't have a ""push"" rule. 

This is really frustrating. Maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move that rule left, but it's protected by the wall. 

Alternatively, use the ""door"" to go around. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move through the door, but I don't know if doors are passable. 

In some Baba levels, doors can be opened by pushing them or if there's a key, but here there's no key mentioned. 

Wait, the ""ball"" is at 8 right, 3 down. Maybe if I make the ball the win, then I can go get it. 

To do that:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

2. Move right and down to the ball's location. But the path is blocked by walls. 

From the ""is"" rule's position (1 up), moving right 7 times would require passing through the wall at 4 right, 1 up. Can't do that. 

Alternative route: Move down from the ""is"" rule to 1 down, then right. But there's a wall at 4 right, which is still blocking. 

I think I'm missing something here. Let me look at the objects again. 

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 right, 1 up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule somewhere. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I could change the ""win"" property. 

But the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up, and the other ""is"" is at 8 right, 1 up. So if I move that ""is"" to be next to ""win,"" making ""win is [something]."" 

For example, if I make ""win is push,"" but I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, make ""win is you,"" but I'm already ""you."" 

This isn't working. 

Maybe the answer is simpler. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" and there's a ""win"" rule, if I can touch the ""win"" rule, I win. But it's blocked by walls. The only way is to move the walls. 

But how? There's a ""wall"" rule at 1 left. If I can change that to something else, like ""push,"" then I can push the wall. 

So:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

2. Move left to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left.

But there's a wall at 1 left, which is the same position as the ""wall"" rule. So I can't move left past it. 

Wait, maybe the ""wall"" rule is at 1 step to the left from where? From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving left would take me to 2 left, 5 down, but there's a ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left, which is probably at the same level as my current position. 

This is getting too confusing without a visual. 

Alternative Idea: Since the ""win"" is a rule, and I'm ""you,"" maybe if I can make myself a ""win"" by combining rules. For example, if there's a ""baba is win"" rule. Currently, the active rule is ""baba is you."" If I can create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and changing its property. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The ""is"" rule I need is at 1 step up initially. So:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

2. Move left to the ""baba"" rule's position (1 left, 5 down). But there's a wall at 1 step left, which is probably blocking the path. 

Therefore, I can't move left past the wall. 

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to use the other ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""baba,"" then I can make ""baba is win."" 

But how to get there? From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving right 7 times would get to 8 right, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. So can't go that way. 

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to accept that I can't reach the ""win"" and have to find another way. 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move to the door and maybe push it","

Let's try to figure this out. The active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that. Let's look at the objects on the map.

There's a ""win"" rule positioned at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to use the door? Wait, how do doors work? Oh right, sometimes ""door is win"" would make hitting a door the win condition, but currently, the active rules don't have that. 

Looking at the positions, the ""rule is"" blocks are spread out. The closest ""is"" is 1 step up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" somewhere to change the rules. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""win"", it could become ""win is you"" or something. But wait, I need to check if I can move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", and ""is"" isn't a stop or wall, I should be able to move it.

The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. Maybe moving the ball towards the door? Or perhaps combining text blocks. Let's see. If I move the ""is"" block that's 1 step up next to the ""win"" at 9 steps right, 1 step up, then it could create a new rule like ""win is you"". But how do I get the ""is"" there? Right now, the ""is"" is 1 step up from Baba's position. Wait, where is Baba exactly? Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule baba"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So Baba is at (1 left, 5 down). The ""is"" block is 1 step up from there, so possibly at (1 left, 4 down). 

If I move up from Baba's position, I can reach the ""is"" block. Then, by moving it to the ""win"" location, which is 9 steps right and 1 step up, I can create ""win is you"". That would make touching the win object win the game. Alternatively, maybe moving ""is"" next to ""you"" to change what we are. 

Another option: the ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on it would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". But the ""win"" is far to the right. 

Alternatively, use the ball. If the ball is an object I can push, maybe moving it to a certain position. But the ball's current position is 1 right and 1 up. There's a ""stop"" block at 3 right, 2 down. So pushing the ball might be blocked. 

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you"". So I can move any non-stop objects. The ""is"" blocks aren't stop, so I can move them. Let's plan: move the ""is"" block that's 1 step up (which is adjacent to Baba) to the ""win"" location. To do that, first, move Baba to the ""is"" block. Since Baba is at 1 left, 5 down. To get to the ""is"" at 1 left, 4 down, I need to move up once. So action: up. Then, pick up the ""is"" block and move it right 8 steps and down 0 steps to reach the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. Wait, the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up from where? The ""is"" block is currently at 1 left, 4 down. To get to 9 right, 1 up, I need to move right 10 steps (since 1 left to 9 right is +10) and up 1 step. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, find another ""is"" block at 8 right, 1 up. Maybe move that one instead. The ""is"" at 8 right, 1 up is closer to the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. So if I can move that ""is"" block one step to the right, it would be next to ""win"", making ""win is you"". But how to get there? The path from Baba's position (1 left,5 down) to 8 right,1 up is quite a journey. There are walls in the way. For example, wall at 4 right,1 up, which is between the initial ""is"" blocks. So maybe need to find a way around the walls. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push things. But the ball is at 1 right,1 up, near the first ""is"". Maybe move the ball out of the way first. But there's a wall at 4 right,1 up, so pushing the ball right wouldn't work. 

Another angle: the ""you"" rule is at 1 right,5 down. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would work. To do that, move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. Baba is at 1 left,5 down. That's a far distance. Maybe not feasible. 

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""flag is win"" or something, but there's no flag here. 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on it would win. To do that, need to move an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, which is diagonally up from the door. Maybe move the ""is"" from 8 right,1 up (the other ""is"") to between door and win. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, the ""stop"" block at 3 right,2 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property, then maybe push things past it. But to do that, I need to change the rule. For example, ""stop is nothing"", but there's no ""nothing"" object. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me recap. The key is to move an ""is"" block next to the object we want to redefine. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", I am Baba. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe the solution is to reassign the ""win"" rule to something reachable. 

Looking at the ""is"" blocks: the one at 1 step up (adjacent to Baba) and the one at 8 right,1 up. If I move the 8 right,1 up ""is"" block to the ""win"" at 9 right,1 up, then it becomes ""win is [whatever is next]"". If I place it next to ""win"", it would be ""win is [object adjacent]"". But what's adjacent to ""win""? The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. The adjacent objects are the ""rule is"" at 8 right,1 up and the ""ball"" at 8 right,3 down? No, the ball is at 8 right,3 down. So placing ""is"" next to ""win"" would make ""win is [something]"". If I can make it ""win is you"", then touching win would win. 

To do that, move the ""is"" block from 8 right,1 up to 9 right,1 up (next to ""win""). That would require moving right once. But how to get there? The path from 8 right,1 up to 9 right,1 up is clear? Let's check the objects. Between 8 right,1 up and 9 right,1 up, is there a wall? The next object is ""win"" at 9 right,1 up, so it's adjacent. So moving the ""is"" block right once would place it next to ""win"", creating ""win is you"". 

But how to move that ""is"" block? To pick it up, I need to be adjacent to it. Baba is at 1 left,5 down. To reach 8 right,1 up, I need to move right 9 steps and up 4 steps. There are walls along the way. For example, at 4 right,1 up there's a wall. So moving right directly isn't possible. Maybe need to go around. 

Alternative path: move up from Baba's position to 1 left,4 down. Then right to 4 right,4 down, but there's a wall at 4 right,1 up, but that's up, not down. Wait, the walls are at specific positions. Let me list all walls:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up (from Baba's starting position)
- wall 4 steps to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule stop 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 5 steps down

So moving right from Baba's position (1 left,5 down) towards the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up is blocked by walls at 4 right,1 up, etc. Maybe need to find a different route. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push walls aside? But the ball can't push walls because walls are stop. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the initial approach of moving the nearby ""is"" block up to the top where the ""win"" is. Let's try:

1. Move up from Baba's position (1 left,5 down) to the ""is"" block at 1 left,4 down (action: up).
2. Now, move the ""is"" block right towards the ""win"". But the path is blocked by walls at 4 right,1 up. Wait, no, the walls are at specific positions. From 1 left,4 down, moving right, the first few steps are clear until reaching 4 right, which has a wall. So maybe can't go that way. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block up. From 1 left,4 down, move up to 1 left,3 down. Then right to 4 left? No, that's not making sense. Maybe this isn't the right path. 

Another idea: The ""you"" rule is at 1 right,5 down. If I can make ""you"" into something else, maybe ""you"" is win. But how? If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win"". For example, place ""is"" between ""you"" and ""win"", making ""you is win"". But ""win"" is far away. 

Alternatively, create a rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, move an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""baba"" is at 1 left,5 down, and ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. That's a long distance. 

Wait, maybe there's a shorter path using other objects. The ""door"" at 8 right,2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then stepping on it would win. To do that, need to move an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. So placing ""is"" between them would require moving it diagonally, which isn't possible. 

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to focus on the immediate area. The closest ""is"" block is 1 step up from Baba. If I move that ""is"" block to the ""ball"" which is 1 right,1 up, then create a rule like ""ball is win"". But the ball is at 1 right,1 up, which is adjacent to the ""is"" block. So moving the ""is"" next to the ball would make ""ball is win"", and then I could push the ball to the ""win"" location. But the ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, and the ball is at 1 right,1 up. There's a wall at 4 right,1 up, so pushing the ball right isn't possible. 

Alternatively, if I make ""ball is you"", then I could move the ball. But currently, the active rule is ""baba is you"". If I change it to ""ball is you"", then I control the ball. But how? To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to ""ball"" and ""you"". The ""you"" is at 1 right,5 down. That's far from the ball. 

Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try the simplest possible action. Since the previous actions resulted in defaults to idle, perhaps the issue is that the model isn't correctly identifying movable objects. Let's look again. 

Baba is at 1 left,5 down. The ""is"" block is 1 step up. So to pick it up, move up once. Then, move right to reach the ""win"" at 9 right,1 up. But the path is blocked. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location indirectly. 

Alternatively, push a wall if possible, but walls are stop. 

Wait, maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes the door the win condition. For example, move the ""is"" block from 8 right,1 up to 7 right,2 down (next to the door at 8 right,2 down), making ""door is win"". Then, step on the door. But how to get there? 

Baba needs to navigate from 1 left,5 down to 7 right,2 down. The path is blocked by walls at 4 right, various positions. 

This seems really complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block next to the ""win"" by using the ball as a bridge? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, notice that the ""rule you"" is at 1 right,5 down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win"", making ""you is win"". But again, the distance is too great. 

Wait, another angle: the ""win"" rule is at 9 right,1 up. If I can make ""win"" into a ""you"" rule, then touching it would win. To do that, move an ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you"". The ""you"" is at 1 right,5 down. So place ""is"" between ""win"" and ""you"", but that's a diagonal movement, which isn't possible. 

Alternatively, create a rule like ""win is you"" directly. To do that, need to have ""is"" next to both ""win"" and ""you"". But they are far apart. 

I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is to simply move the ""is"" block next to the ""win"" by moving it right once. Even though the path is blocked, perhaps in the game you can move around walls by pushing them if they're not stop. Wait, no, walls are stop, you can't push them. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block from 8 right,1 up to 9 right,1 up (next to ""win""), even if it requires moving through other objects. But how? 

Wait, the ""is"" block at 8 right,1 up is adjacent to the ""rule is"" at 8 right,1 up. Wait, no, there's another ""is"" at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. So if I move that ""is"" block one step to the right, it would be next to ""win"". So action: right. But is that possible? Let's see. 

Baba is at 1 left,5 down. To reach the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up, need to move right 9 steps and up 4 steps. There's a wall at 4 right,1 up, so can't go that way. Maybe go around the wall. For example, move up to 1 left,4 down, then right to 4 left (no, that's not right), maybe this isn't feasible. 

Alternatively, use the ball to create a path. Push the ball against the wall to move it, but walls are stop, so can't. 

I think I'm missing something obvious. Let's look again at the objects. There's a ""door"" at 8 right,2 down. If I can make the door the win condition, then stepping on it would win. To do that, move an ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. So placing ""is"" between door and win would require moving diagonally, which isn't possible. 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. If I move the ""is"" block from 8 right,1 up to 8 right,2 down (next to the door), then create ""door is win"". So action sequence: move up to the ""is"" at 8 right,1 up, then down to 8 right,2 down, then place ""is"" next to door. Then, step on the door. 

But how to move from 8 right,1 up to 8 right,2 down? That requires moving down once. Then, place the ""is"" next to door (which is at same x, y+1). So place the ""is"" at 8 right,2 down, making ""door is win"". Then, move to the door and step on it. 

But how to get to 8 right,1 up in the first place? From Baba's position (1 left,5 down), need to move right 9 steps and up 4 steps. Blocked by walls. 

This is really frustrating. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block up to the top and create ""win is you"". Even if the path is blocked, perhaps the model should just output the action to move the ""is"" block right despite the walls, assuming the game allows it. 

Alternatively, the correct action is to move the ""is"" block next to the ""win"" by moving right once from its current position (8 right,1 up to 9 right,1 up). The action would be ""right"". 

Even though there's a wall at 4 right,1 up, which is not","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. The walls are blocking direct paths. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which means anything touching that can't be moved through. The ""ball"" might be important. Maybe I need to move the ball somewhere? But how? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can push objects unless they're defined as STOP. The wall at 4 steps right is STOP? Wait, no, the STOP rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So walls are regular walls unless modified.

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you"", so I can move around. Let me see my position. The ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is probably where I am, since that's a rule block. So I'm at 1 step up. To the right and up is a ball. Below me, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. To the left is a wall at 1 step left. So maybe I need to move right towards the ball or the win position.

But the path to the win position (9 steps right, 1 step up) is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up, and others further right. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to interact with that door. But how? To open a door, sometimes you need a key, but there's no key mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe changing the rules to make the door passable.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move the ball, perhaps placing it near the door? But how? Since I'm Baba, I can push objects that aren't STOP. The wall at 4 steps right is a regular wall, but if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere, that would block. Let me check the active rules. The only rules are ""baba is you"", ""is"" rules pointing to properties, ""win"" at 9 steps right, etc. So walls are movable unless they have a STOP rule. But the walls here are just regular walls.

Wait, the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" means that the wall at 1 step left has the property WALL. Similarly, the wall at 4 steps right is also a WALL. But since there's no ""wall is stop"" rule, they can be pushed. So maybe I can move the walls out of the way. But how do I push them? Since I'm Baba (you), I can push them.

But my current position is at the ""rule `is` 1 step up"". Let me map out the positions. Let's assume I'm at position (0,0). The ""rule `is` 1 step up"" would be at (0,1). The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from there, so (1,1). The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is (4,1). The ""win"" is at (9,1). The door is at (8,2), and the ball is at (8,3). 

To get to the win position, I need to move right past the walls. But the walls at (4,1) and others are in the way. Maybe I can push the walls. Let's see. From my position at (0,1), moving right to (1,1) where the ball is. Can I push the ball? The ball's rule is ""rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down"", so the ball is at (8,3). But the ball is currently at (1,1)? Wait, no. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""rule `is`"" at (0,1), so that's (1,1). But the ""rule `ball`"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down from some position. Maybe the rule blocks are separate. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""door is you"" or ""door is win"", but to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. The ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you"", then I can create a new rule. But how do I move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba, and there's no ""stop"" on the ""is"" rule, I should be able to push it.

So, my plan is: move the ""is"" rule block to reassign properties. Let's see. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I move down to take that ""is"" block and place it next to ""door"" and ""you"", I can create a new rule. For example, ""door is you"" would make the door act as the player, or ""door is win"" to make the door the win condition.

But to do that, I need to navigate to the ""is"" block at 1 step up, pick it up (by moving onto it?), and then move it to the desired location. Let's map my movement. Currently, I'm at the position of the ""is"" rule block, 1 step up. If I move down (to my original position), then right towards the door at (8,2). But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""you"" rule at 5 steps down. 

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" block there, creating ""you is you"", which doesn't make sense, or maybe move it to ""door"" and ""win"". 

Alternatively, the current active rules include ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So moving the ""is"" block between them would create ""baba is win"", making touching Baba the win condition. Then I just need to reach my own position, which is already the case. 

But how to move the ""is"" block. Let's see. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I move down to my original position, then left or right. But there's a wall at 1 step left. So maybe move the ""is"" block to the right. From (0,1), move right to (1,1) (the ball), but the ball is an object. Can I push the ball? The ball's rule is ""rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down"", so it's at (8,3). Wait, no. The ball's position is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""rule `is`"" at (0,1), so (1,1). But there's also a ""rule `ball`"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down from another position. This is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. If I move down to my original position (assuming I was there before), then move right towards the ""win"" rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to push the walls. For example, from (0,0), move right to (1,0), but there's a wall at 1 step left? Wait, the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is at (-1,0), which is a wall to the left of my starting position. So I can't move left. 

This level seems to require reassigning rules. The key might be to make the door the win condition. To do that, I need to create ""door is win"". To do that, move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win"". The ""door"" is at (8,2), and ""win"" is at (9,1). The ""is"" block is at (0,1). So I need to move the ""is"" block from (0,1) to somewhere between ""door"" and ""win"". 

How to get there? From (0,1), move down to (0,0), then right towards (8,2). But the path is blocked by walls at (4,1), (4,2), etc. Maybe push the walls. For example, push the wall at (4,1) to the right. Since I'm Baba (can push non-STOP objects), I can move right into the wall, pushing it to the right. 

So step by step: 

1. From (0,1), move down to (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0). But is there a wall here? The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is at (-1,0), so (1,0) is clear.
3. Continue moving right until I reach the wall at (4,1). But to get there, I need to go up to (4,0) and then up to (4,1). Wait, maybe a different path. 

Alternatively, from (0,1), move right to (1,1) (the ball), then down to (1,0). But the ball is at (1,1), can I push it? The ball's rule is ""rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down"", so it's at (8,3) in the map. Wait, no, the ball's position is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""rule `is`"" at (0,1), so (1,1). So the ball is at (1,1). If I move right from (0,1) to (1,1), which is the ball. Then, since I can push non-STOP objects, I can push the ball. 

If I push the ball to the right, it would go to (2,1). But is there a STOP there? The ""stop"" rule is at (3,2), so not in the way. Pushing the ball might open a path. 

So:

1. Move right to (1,1) (ball).
2. Move right again to (2,1), pushing the ball.
3. Continue right to (3,1). But there's a wall at (4,1). Can I push the wall at (4,1)? Since there's no ""wall is stop"" rule, I can push it. So move right into (4,1), pushing it to (5,1).
4. Now, the path to the right is cleared. Move right to (5,1), (6,1), etc., towards the ""win"" at (9,1).

But along the way, there's a ""door"" at (8,2). If I can get to the ""is"" block and move it near the door and win, that would help. 

Alternatively, after pushing the walls out of the way, reach the ""win"" at (9,1). But there's a wall at (4,1) which I pushed to (5,1), but maybe not. This is getting too vague. 

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can turn into a WIN by making ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at (1 step left, 5 steps down), which is (-1,5) if I'm at (0,0). The ""win"" is at (9,1). The ""is"" block is at (0,1). So I need to move the ""is"" block from (0,1) to somewhere between ""baba"" and ""win"". 

But how to navigate there? The path from (0,1) to (-1,5) is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" block down to (0,0), then left to (-1,0), but there's a wall at (-1,0) from the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"". So I can't go left. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to create a rule like ""door is you"", allowing me to step on the door to win. To do that, move the ""is"" block to the door's position and the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at (1 step right, 5 steps down), which is (1,5). The door is at (8,2). So moving the ""is"" block from (0,1) to (8,2) and (1,5) to make ""door is you"". 

To move the ""is"" block: 

1. From (0,1), move down to (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0), (2,0), ..., up to (8,0).
3. Move up to (8,1), then right to (8,2) (door).
4. Place the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you"". 

But the ""you"" rule is at (1,5), which is quite far. This might require a lot of movements. 

Alternatively, maybe the intended solution is to push the ball to the door and then use it to open the door, but I don't see a key. 

Wait, the ""ball"" is at (1,1). If I can push it to (8,3), which is its rule position, maybe that activates something. Not sure. 

Another thought: The ""win"" rule is at (9,1). If I can make ""baba is win"", then just touching Baba would win. To do that, move the ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,5), and ""win"" is at (9,1). The ""is"" block is at (0,1). So moving the ""is"" block from (0,1) to, say, (5,3) to bridge the gap between ""baba"" and ""win"". But how? 

This is getting too complicated. Let's think step by step. 

Current position: Assume I'm at the ""rule `is`"" block at (0,1). 

Possible actions: Move up, down, left, right. 

If I move down to (0,0), that's my original position. From there, I can try to move right, but there's a wall at (1,0)? No, the wall at 1 step left is at (-1,0). So moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) is possible. 

Then, move right to (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), etc. But at (4,0), there's a wall at (4,1), but that's above. So moving down to (4,0) is possible. Then move up to (4,1), which is a wall. Can I push it? Yes, since there's no STOP. Push it right to (5,1). 

Now, the path to the right is clear from (0,0) to (5,1). Then move right to (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1) which is the win. 

But wait, there's a ""stop"" rule at (3,2). So if I move up to (8,1), then right to (9,1), that's the win. But need to check if there are walls blocking. 

Alternatively, after pushing the wall at (4,1) to (5,1), move right past it. 

So the steps could be:

1. Move down from (0,1) to (0,0).
2. Move right to (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0).
3. Move up to (4,1) (a wall), push it right to (5,1).
4. Move right to (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1) (win).

But at (8,1), there's a ""rule `door`"" at (8,2). So from (8,1), move up to (8,2) which is the door. But to pass through the door, maybe there's a rule like ""door is pass"" or I need to have a key. Since there's no key, perhaps the door is a red herring. 

Alternatively, after reaching (9,1), which is the ""win"" rule, does that mean I win just by being there? But normally, you have to be the WIN object. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"" and ""win"" is a separate object, I need to either become WIN or interact with it. 

If I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block, then touching Baba would make me win. So maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block to link ""baba"" and ""win"". 

To do that:

1. From (0,1), move down to (0,0).
2. Move left to (-1,0), but there's a wall at (-1,0) from ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"". Can't go left.
3. Move right to (1,0), etc., as before, push the wall at (4,1) to (5,1).
4. Now, move to the ""baba"" rule at (-1,5). But that's a long way. Alternatively, move to the ""you"" rule at (1,5).
5. Maybe create ""you is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win"". 

This seems too complex. Perhaps the intended solution is to push the ball to the door and then use it to open the door, but I don","

I'm stuck in this Baba Is You game again. The game keeps defaulting to idle because I'm not providing a valid action, so I need to figure out what to do. Let me look at the observation again.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The objects on the map include multiple rules and walls. The ""win"" object is 9 steps to the right and up, which is probably the goal. But there are walls and a stop rule blocking the path. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""is"" up one step. Maybe I can move that rule to change something. If I can rewrite a rule, like turning ""wall is stop"" into something else, that might help. For example, if I make ""stop is push"" or something, but I need to find the text blocks first.

Wait, there's a ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe that's part of another rule like ""wall is stop."" If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""wall"" or ""stop,"" I can change their properties. But how do I get there? The ball is nearby, but I don't know if I can push it. 

Alternatively, the ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door passable, maybe by changing the ""stop"" rule. There's a ""rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down."" If I move that ""stop"" rule away or change it to something else, the door might not block me anymore. 

But I need to move the rules. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. Are the text blocks movable? I think only if they don't have a ""stop"" or similar property. Let me check the active rules again. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So any object under that rule can't be moved. 

The ""is"" rule at 1 step up might be movable. If I move that ""is"" next to ""wall"" or another object, I can rewrite the rule. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, moving the ""is"" to make it ""wall is you"" or something. But where is the original ""wall is stop"" rule? The observation shows ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe those are parts of different rules. 

Wait, the initial setup probably has ""wall is stop"" somewhere. If I can break that rule by moving the ""stop"" part away. For example, if the ""stop"" rule is attached to ""wall,"" moving them apart would make the wall not stop. Then I could push past the wall. 

But how to do that? Let me locate the ""wall is stop"" rule. The objects list has ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" and ""wall 4 steps to the right."" Maybe the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is part of ""wall is stop"" by being next to the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""wall"" text block away from the ""stop"" rule, that rule would be broken. 

So, if I move the ""wall"" rule that's 1 step to the left, away from the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, maybe that would change things. But how to navigate there? My current position isn't clear, but the active rules and objects are listed. Maybe I need to move right towards the ""is"" rules to find the text blocks. 

Alternatively, the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down is behind a ""stop"" wall. If I can make the ""stop"" rule not apply to the door, then I could go through it. Or if I can make the door a ""win"" instead. 

Another thought: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push objects. If there's a ball nearby, perhaps I can push it into a rule to rewrite it. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up, next to the ""is"" rule. If I push the ball onto the ""is"" rule, maybe that creates a new rule. For example, ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win."" 

But I need to move the ball. Since I'm Baba, and assuming I can push objects that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, so objects in other areas might be movable. The ball is adjacent to an ""is"" rule, so maybe I can move the ball onto that ""is"" to create a new rule. If I move right to the ball's position and then push it onto the ""is"" rule, that could create something like ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win."" 

If I make ""ball is win,"" then standing on the ball would make me win. Alternatively, if I make ""ball is you,"" then the ball becomes the controller. But since the goal is to reach the ""win"" object, maybe making the ball the win condition would let me touch it. 

So, possible steps:
1. Move right to the ball.
2. Push the ball onto the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step up to create ""ball is [something].""
3. If it becomes ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win.

Alternatively, move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up and combine it with the ball to make ""ball is you,"" then move the ball to the win area.

But how to execute this? Let's break it down. Currently, I'm assuming my position is somewhere. The ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is probably above me. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up. So if I'm at the position of the first ""is"" rule, moving right would take me to the ball. Then, pushing the ball right towards the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step up. 

But I need to check if the path is clear. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, which is further to the right. So moving right from the ball's position (1 step right and 1 step up) would require passing through the wall at 4 steps right. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which might not block vertical movement. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, then right to the ball, then push the ball towards the ""is"" at 8 steps right. But I need to avoid the walls. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since I'm Baba and can move, I can try to reach the ""win"" object at 9 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make that wall not a stop, then I can push past it. To do that, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and break it. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe the ""wall is stop"" is formed by the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left next to the ""stop"" rule somewhere. But the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is not adjacent. 

Alternatively, the ""wall is stop"" could be a separate rule that's not visible here. Wait, the active rules only show ""baba is you."" The other rules must be in the objects as text blocks. For example, ""wall is stop"" is probably a text block composed of ""wall"" and ""is"" and ""stop"" arranged properly. But in the current observation, the objects include ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe these are parts of different rules. 

This is confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""is"" rule to modify another rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up next to the ""win"" rule, it could create ""win is [something]."" But the ""win"" rule is already at 9 steps right and 1 step up. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" to make ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win."" If I push the ""is"" rule to the ball's position, combining them would create a new rule. 

The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Another idea: the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, maybe by changing the ""stop"" rule. But the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, the door might no longer be stopped. 

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" and the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, I need to navigate there. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a ""stop"" wall. Can I push past it? Probably not, because it's stopped. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to rewrite the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" instead of another object being you, but I'm already Baba and you. 

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so that's set. Maybe I need to make the win condition different. For example, ""flag is win"" or something, but there's no flag here. The win is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. 

Alternatively, if I can make the ""win"" rule apply to Baba by moving ""is"" next to Baba. But Baba's rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 5 steps down, 1 step left. So if I can move the ""is"" rule up to where Baba is, it could create ""baba is [something].""

But the ""is"" rule at 5 steps down is already next to the ""baba"" rule. The observation says ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 5 steps down."" So they are adjacent. That probably forms the rule ""baba is [something]."" But what's the something? It might be incomplete. 

Maybe the ""is"" rule at 5 steps down is meant to be attached to another rule. If I can move it to connect with ""you"" or another property. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. So if I move the ""is"" rule from 5 steps down to be between ""baba"" and ""you,"" it would make ""baba is you,"" which is already the case. 

This isn't helping. Let's try to summarize:

- Goal: Reach the ""win"" object at 9 steps right, 1 step up.
- Obstacles: Walls at 4 steps right, 1 step up (which is a ""stop"" wall) and others.
- Rules: ""baba is you,"" other rules are text blocks that can be moved.

Possible actions:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up and combine it with the ball to make ""ball is win.""
2. Move to the ""stop"" rule and remove it to allow passing through walls.
3. Push the wall rule away from the ""stop"" rule to break ""wall is stop.""
4. Use the ball to activate the door by making it a ""win.""

Given the positions, the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up, next to an ""is"" rule. If I move right to the ball, then right again towards the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right, I could push the ball onto that ""is"" to create ""ball is [something]."" If it becomes ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. 

So the steps would be:
- Move right to the ball.
- Push the ball right towards the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step up.
- This creates ""ball is win.""
- Then move to the ball's new position (next to the ""win"" rule) and touch it to win.

But how to execute this in the game? The current observation shows the ball at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I'm at the position of the ""is"" rule 1 step up, moving right would take me to the ball. Then, pushing the ball right would require moving right again, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. However, the ball might be small enough to push past the wall if the rule allows. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule to the ball's location first. For example, move the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step up to be next to the ball. But that's a distance of 7 steps right, which seems too far. 

Maybe the best bet is to move right towards the ball, pick it up, and push it onto the nearby ""is"" rule to create a new rule. If that makes the ball the win condition, then touching it would solve the level. 

So the action would be to move right towards the ball. The previous actions were left, up, right, etc., but the system kept defaulting to idle. Maybe the correct sequence is to move right twice: first to reach the ball, then push it right onto the ""is"" rule. 

But given the observations, I need to choose the next action. Based on the latest observation, the active rules and objects are the same. The last action was ""left,"" which didn't work. Maybe I need to try moving right again to get to the ball. 

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, then right to the ball, then right again to push the ball onto the ""is"" at 8 steps right. But navigation is key here. 

Given the confusion, the safest valid action that could lead to progress is to move right towards the ball. So the chosen action is ""right.""

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if any rules have changed that. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule win"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So normally, I need to get there.

Now, the map layout: There's a ball at 1 step up (to my right, maybe?). Walls are blocking some paths. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down, so anything there can't be moved. The ""door"" is at 7 right and 2 down. Maybe I can push the ball to interact with the door or something?

Wait, the ball is at 7 right and 3 down. Maybe I need to move it? But how? Since I'm Baba, and the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move around unless there's a ""stop"" or ""wall."" The walls are at specific positions, but I think I can move past them unless they're in the way.

Looking at my current position: The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So I'm probably at that location. The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, 1 step right from the ""is"" rule. Wait, maybe I need to move to that ""you"" rule to reinforce my identity? Or maybe I can pick up the ""you"" rule and move it somewhere else.

Alternatively, the ""win"" is 9 steps right and 1 up. To get there, I need to navigate around the walls. Let's see: From my current position (2 left, 5 down), moving up might get me past some walls. But there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. Hmm. Maybe moving left first? Or right?

Wait, there's a rule ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule near the ""win"" or ""ball,"" maybe I can create a new rule. For example, ""ball is win"" or ""baba is win."" But how?

I need to check if I can pick up the ""is"" rule. Since ""baba is you,"" and unless there's a ""stop"" on the ""is"" rule, I should be able to move it. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. If I move up to get there, then take the ""is"" rule and move it to the ball's location, then say ""ball is win,"" that would make the ball the win condition. Then I just need to reach the ball.

So step by step: Move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 left and 1 up. Then move right to the ball's position (7 right and 3 down). But wait, the path might be blocked. Let's see. From the ""is"" rule at 1 left and 1 up, moving right would take me towards the ball. But there are walls at 3 steps right and 1 up, and other walls down. Maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" location. If I can place ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""ball,"" then ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition. Then pushing the ball to my current position would make me win.

But how to get the ""is"" rule there. Maybe first move up to the ""is"" rule, then carry it to the ball's location. Let's map this out.

Current position: rule `baba` is at 2 left, 5 down. So I'm there. To get to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up: I need to move up 4 steps? Wait, no. The positions are relative. Let me parse the positions properly.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from where? Probably from the player's position. Wait, the observation lists all objects with their positions relative to the player. So ""rule `is` 1 step up"" means it's one step up from the player. Similarly, ""ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" is diagonally right-up.

So the player is at a central point, and all other objects are positioned relative to that. So the player's position is the origin. Let's assume:

- The player is at (0,0).

Then:

- ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is at (0,1).

- ""ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" is at (1,1).

- ""wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is at (4,1).

- ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is at (8,1).

- ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is at (9,1).

- ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is at (-1,0).

- ""wall 4 steps to the right"" is at (4,0).

- ""wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down"" is at (4,-1).

- ""rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" is at (3,-2).

- ""wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" is at (3,-2).

- ""rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down"" is at (7,-2).

- ""wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" is at (3,-3).

- ""rule `ball` 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" is at (7,-3).

- ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down"" is at (3,-4).

- ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"" is at (-1,-5).

- ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"" is at (-1,-5).

Wait, that can't be right. The ""rule `baba`"" is at (-1,-5), and the ""rule `is`"" is also at (-1,-5)? That seems like they're stacked. Maybe the player is at (0,0), and all other objects are relative. So the ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step left and 5 down from the player's position, so at (-1,-5). The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 5 down is the same position? That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a typo, but perhaps the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left (from the player) and 5 steps down, so same as the ""baba"" rule. That would mean both are at (-1,-5). Then the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 5 steps down, so (1,-5).

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to visualize the grid.

Player is at (0,0).

Looking at the objects:

- rule `is` 1 step up: (0,1)

- ball 1 right 1 up: (1,1)

- wall 4 right 1 up: (4,1)

- rule `is` 8 right 1 up: (8,1)

- rule `win` 9 right 1 up: (9,1)

- rule `wall` 1 left: (-1,0)

- wall 4 right: (4,0)

- wall 4 right 1 down: (4,-1)

- rule `stop` 3 right 2 down: (3,-2)

- wall 3 right 2 down: (3,-2)

- rule `door` 7 right 2 down: (7,-2)

- wall 3 right 3 down: (3,-3)

- rule `ball` 7 right 3 down: (7,-3)

- wall 3 right 4 down: (3,-4)

- rule `baba` 1 left 5 down: (-1,-5)

- rule `is` 1 left 5 down: (-1,-5)

- rule `you` 1 right 5 down: (1,-5)

- wall 4 right 5 down: (4,-5)

So, the player is at (0,0). The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-5), which is 1 left and 5 down from the player. The ""you"" rule is at (1,-5). So to become ""you,"" I need to be on the same tile as the ""you"" rule or move it to me.

But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I am Baba and thus can move, but my identity is Baba. To change the win condition, maybe I need to create a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""ball is win.""

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at (9,1), but it's protected by a ""stop"" at (3,-2) and other walls. Maybe there's a path to (9,1) through the upper right. Let's see:

From (0,0), going up to (0,1) where there's a rule `is`. If I can pick that up, then move it to (9,1) and say ""win is you"" or something. But I need to create a ""win"" rule. Wait, the existing ""win"" is at (9,1), but it's a static object. Maybe I can overwrite it by placing a new rule there.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" and I can push objects if they're not stopped. The ball is at (7,-3). If I can push it towards me or towards the ""win"" at (9,1), but there's a wall at (4,1) and other obstacles.

Another approach: Create a rule that makes the ball win. So, move the ""is"" rule to the ball's location (7,-3) and then place ""ball is win."" Then, going to the ball would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from (0,1) to (7,-3). The path from (0,1) to (7,-3) would require moving right 7 steps and down 4 steps. But there are walls along the way. For example, at (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), etc. So maybe detour around them.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" location (9,1) and make ""win"" be something else. But the ""win"" is already there. Maybe ""baba is win,"" but I need to create that rule.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are objects on the map that I can pick up and move.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at (0,1).

2. Pick it up and carry it to the ball at (7,-3).

3. Place the ""is"" next to the ball and say ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition.

4. Then move to the ball's location to win.

But how to move the ""is"" rule there. Let's see the path:

From (0,0) to (0,1): move up.

Then from (0,1) to (7,-3): need to go right 7 and down 4. However, there's a wall at (4,1), which is blocking the direct path up. So maybe go around the walls.

Alternatively, move right past the walls. Let's see:

From (0,1), move right to (1,1) (ball's position), but there's a wall at (4,1), but maybe not immediately. Wait, the ball is at (1,1), which is one step right and up from the player. Wait, no, the ball is at (1,1), which is diagonally right and up from (0,0). But the wall at (4,1) is four steps right and one up. So between (0,1) and (4,1) there's open space? Or are there walls in between?

Looking at the objects:

- At (4,1) there's a wall.

- So from (0,1), moving right to (1,1) (ball), then (2,1), (3,1), then (4,1) is a wall. So can't go straight right.

Alternative path: From (0,1), move down to (0,0), then right to (4,0) (wall), so that's blocked. Maybe move down to (0,-1), then right? But there's a wall at (4,-1). Hmm.

Alternatively, move down to (0,-1), then right to (3,-1), but (4,-1) is a wall. So perhaps move to (3,-1), then down to (3,-2) which is a ""stop"" rule. Can't move through ""stop.""

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to move the ""is"" rule to the ""you"" rule's location. The ""you"" rule is at (1,-5). If I can make ""baba is you"" by placing the ""is"" next to ""baba,"" but the ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-5). So moving to (-1,-5), pick up the ""is"" rule from (0,1), carry it down to (-1,-5), place it there, making ""baba is you"" which is already the case. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to the ""win"" location (9,1) and create a new rule like ""baba is win."" But how to get there.

From (0,1) to (9,1): move right 9 steps. But there's a wall at (4,1), so can't go that way. Maybe go around the wall by moving down, right, up.

From (0,1) move down to (0,0), right to (4,0) (wall), so can't. Move down to (0,-1), right to (3,-1), then down to (3,-2) which is a stop. Can't move through there.

Alternatively, move right to (1,1), down to (1,0), right to (4,0) (wall). Still stuck.

This is tricky. Maybe the key is to use the door at (7,-2). The ""door"" is interactive; perhaps pushing the ball into it does something. If the ball is made into a ""win,"" then standing on it would win.

So back to the original plan: get the ""is"" rule to the ball's location, make ""ball is win,"" then go to the ball.

To move the ""is"" from (0,1) to (7,-3):

Path: Up to (0,1), right to (1,1), down to (1,0), right to (4,0) (wall), can't. Alternatively, right to (2,1), down to (2,0), right to (3,0), down to (3,-1) (wall). Not working.

Another path: From (0,1), down to (0,0), right to (1,0), down to (1,-1), right to (4,-1) (wall). No.

Maybe go around the back. From (0,1), down to (0,0), left to (-1,0) (rule `wall`), can't move through wall. So stuck there.

Alternative idea: Use the ""door"" at (7,-2). Maybe push the ball into the door to open it, but I need to make the ball a key or something. Not sure.

Wait, the ""door"" requires a key, but there's no key mentioned. Maybe pushing the ball into the door makes it a win if the ball is the win condition.

Alternatively, create a rule ""door is win,"" but that's not helpful unless I can pass through doors.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move to the ""you"" rule at (1,-5) and pick it up to reinforce my identity, but I'm already Baba and ""you.""

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am you. The ""you"" rule is separate; maybe touching it doesn't change anything. But if I can move the ""you"" rule onto me, it might not matter.

Alternatively, find a way to make the ""win"" rule accessible. The ""win"" is at (9,1), but there's a wall at (4,1). Maybe push the wall aside? But walls are defined by ""wall is stop"" or something. Since ""wall is stop"" is a rule, if I can remove that rule, walls become movable. But how?

The current rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are objects on the map. So to remove a rule, I need to move the text block that defines it. For example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at (1 step left). Wait, no. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block that says ""wall is stop""? Because in Baba Is You, a rule like ""wall is stop"" is formed by a ""wall"" text block next to a ""stop"" text block. So the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" probably means there's a ""wall"" text block 1 step left, and a ""stop"" text block somewhere else forming ""wall is stop.""

But in the current observation, the objects include:

- rule `wall` 1 step to the left: This is a text block saying ""wall"" at (-1,0).

- rule `stop` 3 steps right and 2 steps down: A text block saying ""stop"" at (3,-2).

So together, these form the rule ""wall is stop"" because the ""wall"" text block is next to the ""stop"" text block. Wait, but in the map layout, the ""wall"" text block is at (-1,0), and the ""stop"" is at (3,-2). They're not adjacent, so they don't form a rule. Oh right, in Baba Is You, rules are formed when two text blocks are adjacent. So the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" would be a ""wall"" text block 1 step left from the player, and a ""stop"" text block must be adjacent to it to form ""wall is stop."" But in this case, the ""wall"" text block is at (-1,0), and the ""stop"" is at (3,-2), which are not adjacent. So","

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You puzzle. I start by understanding the current situation.

First, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I can interact with the text blocks to change the rules. The goal is usually to reach the win condition, which right now is a 'win' block at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a 'rule `is`' block 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that somewhere to create a new rule.
- A 'ball' is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Not sure how that factors in yet.
- Several walls positioned in a grid pattern, probably blocking paths.
- A 'rule `is`' at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. Similar to the first one.
- The 'win' block is at 9 steps right, 1 step up, which is just past the second 'rule `is`' block.
- There's a 'rule `wall`' at 2 steps left, which might be part of making walls immovable.
- A 'rule `stop`' at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. 'Stop' makes objects unpassable.
- A 'rule `door`' at 7 steps right, 2 steps down. Doors might require something to unlock them, but I don't see a key here.
- A 'rule `ball`' at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. So the ball is defined as a property here, maybe I can use that.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move around unless blocked by 'stop' or 'wall' rules. But the walls here are defined by 'rule `wall`', so maybe I can change that.

The immediate goal is to reach the 'win' block. The path to the right seems blocked by a wall at 4 steps right. But there's a 'rule `is`' block at 8 steps right, 1 step up. If I can move that 'is' block next to the 'win' block, I could create a new rule like ""win is you"" or something else. Wait, but 'win' is already a win condition. Maybe I need to redefine 'you' to be something else that can interact with the win block.

Looking at the bottom part of the map: there's a 'rule `baba`' at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and a 'rule `is`' and 'rule `you`' there. So at 5 steps down, left side, there's a rule that says 'you' is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. Maybe that's another Baba instance or a text block.

Wait, the 'rule `you`' is 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. So if I can get to that 'you' rule, maybe I can move it or combine it with another 'is' rule to change the properties. For example, if I make 'baba is win', then touching the win block would make me win.

But how to do that? Let me think step by step.

First, my current position isn't clear from the observation, but the active rules and objects are listed. I need to assume where Baba is. Since the first 'rule `is`' is 1 step up, maybe Baba is positioned such that moving up would reach that rule block.

But the problem is that when I try to move right towards the 'win' block, there's a wall at 4 steps right. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which might block movement down. The 'door' is at 7 steps right, 2 steps down, but I don't have a way to open it unless there's a corresponding 'key' rule, which I don't see.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can take the 'is' block at 1 step left and 1 step up and move it next to 'baba' somewhere, I could create a new rule like 'baba is win', making touching the win block win the game.

But to move the 'is' block, I need to be adjacent to it. The 'is' block is 1 step left and 1 step up from my current position (assuming I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule at 5 steps down). Wait, the 'rule `baba`' is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So maybe I'm there? Or is that a separate block?

This is a bit confusing without a visual map. Let me try to sketch a mental map.

Looking at the objects:

- Rule `is` at 1 left, 1 up.
- Ball at 1 right, 1 up.
- Wall at 4 right, 1 up.
- Another rule `is` at 8 right, 1 up.
- Win at 9 right, 1 up.
- Rule `wall` at 2 left.
- Wall at 4 right.
- Wall at 4 right, 1 down.
- Rule `stop` at 3 right, 2 down.
- Wall at 4 right, 2 down.
- Rule `door` at 7 right, 2 down.
- Wall at 3 right, 3 down.
- Rule `ball` at 7 right, 3 down.
- Wall at 4 right, 4 down.
- Rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down.
- Rule `is` at 1 left, 5 down.
- Rule `you` at 1 right, 5 down.
- Wall at 4 right, 5 down.

Assuming Baba is at the position of the 'rule `baba`' block, which is 1 left, 5 down. So my current position is 1 left, 5 down. The 'rule `you`' is 1 step to the right and 5 steps down from there. So if I move right once, I can get to the 'you' rule.

But why is that important? Because 'you' defines what controls the player. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', maybe moving the 'you' rule can change how I control. Alternatively, combining 'baba' and 'you' with an 'is' rule.

Looking at the 'rule `is`' at 1 left, 5 down. Maybe I can move that 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win' to create 'baba is win'.

But how to get there? From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving right would take me to the 'you' rule. Then, moving up or down?

Alternatively, maybe I need to get to the 'is' block at 7 right, 1 up. If I can move that 'is' block next to 'win', then I can make 'win' a property of something.

But the path is blocked. There's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. The 'win' is at 9 right, 1 up. So between me and the 'win' is a wall at 4 right, then another wall at 4 right, 1 down. The 'stop' rule is at 3 right, 2 down, which might block movement down there.

Another approach: The 'door' at 7 right, 2 down. If I can make a 'key' rule, maybe I can unlock it. But there's no key mentioned.

Wait, the 'ball' is at 1 right, 1 up. If I can move the 'ball' somewhere, maybe combine it with a rule. The 'rule `ball`' is at 7 right, 3 down. So if I move the 'ball' to that 'ball' rule, maybe it changes its property.

Alternatively, if I make 'ball is you', then touching the ball would make me the player. But I'm already Baba and 'baba is you'. Hmm.

Let me think about moving the 'is' blocks. The 'is' at 1 left, 1 up: if I can move that to be next to 'baba' and 'win', then I can make 'baba is win'. But how to reach that 'is' block.

From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving up 4 steps would get me to the wall at 4 right, 1 up. That's blocked. Alternatively, moving left from here would take me to the 'wall' at 2 left. Not helpful.

Maybe I need to go to the 'is' block at 7 right, 1 up. To get there, I have to navigate through the walls. From my current position (1 left,5 down), move right to 2 left,5 down (but there's a wall at 2 step to the left?), wait the 'rule `wall`' is at 2 step to the left. Wait, the 'rule `wall`' is an object, so it's a text block saying ""wall is ..."". Wait, no: the objects are:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left: this means there's a text block at position 2 steps to the left with the text ""wall"".

So the actual walls are the objects listed as 'wall' at specific positions. For example, 'wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up' is a wall at that position.

So, from my position (assuming I'm at the 'rule `baba`' block at 1 left, 5 down), moving right would take me towards the 'rule `you`' block. If I move right once, I'm at 0 left, 5 down. Then maybe move up?

But there's a 'wall' at 4 right, 1 up, but that's further to the right. Maybe I need to find a path around.

Alternatively, let's think about the 'rule `is`' at 7 right, 1 up. If I can move that to be adjacent to 'win' and 'baba', I can create a new rule. But how to reach that 'is' block.

The 'is' at 7 right, 1 up is on the upper right side. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving right from 1 left,5 down to 0 left,5 down (which is the 'rule `you`' position), then right again to 1 left,5 down's right, which is 0 left,5 down's right? Wait, directions are a bit confusing without coordinates.

Assuming that each step is relative to the current position. Let me try to outline possible moves.

Current position (assuming): 1 left, 5 down (where the 'rule `baba`' is).

Possible moves:

- Right: to 0 left, 5 down (which has the 'rule `you`').
- Left: to 2 left, 5 down (but there's a 'wall' at 2 step to the left, which is a text block saying ""wall"", but the actual wall positions are separate. So maybe moving left isn't blocked by that text block unless it's defining a wall's property.
Wait, the 'rule `wall`' is at 2 step to the left. That means there's a text block saying ""wall"" at that position. So if I move left from my current position (1 left,5 down) to 2 left,5 down, there's a 'wall' text block there. But since the active rule is ""baba is you"", and the 'wall' is defined by a rule, unless there's a ""wall is stop"" or similar, I can move through it. Wait, the walls are actual objects on the map. For example, 'wall 3 steps to the right' is a wall at that position. The 'rule `wall`' at 2 step to the left is a text block that says ""wall"", but unless there's a rule like ""wall is stop"", that text block doesn't make anything a wall. Wait, no: the initial rules are ""baba is you"". The other rules are formed by the text blocks. So the presence of a 'wall' text block at a position doesn't create a wall unless there's a rule that makes 'wall' a stop or something.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me recall the game mechanics. In Baba Is You, the rules are determined by the text blocks on the map. For example, if there's a text block ""BABA IS YOU"", then Baba becomes controllable. If there's ""WALL IS STOP"", then any object named wall becomes a stop (immovable).

So in the current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". All other text blocks are objects that can be moved unless they are under a ""stop"" or similar rule.

So the 'wall' objects on the map (like the one at 3 steps right, 1 step up) are just walls, but unless there's a rule that makes them stop, they can be moved. But in this case, the only active rule is ""baba is you"". So the walls are just there, but can I push them?

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, by default, you can move objects that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So if there's a wall (an object) and there's no rule saying ""wall is stop"", then I can move it. But in this case, is there a rule that makes walls stop? Let's check the objects:

Looking at the objects:

- There's a 'rule `wall`' at 2 step to the left. That's a text block saying ""wall"", but unless there's a rule like ""wall is stop"", it doesn't create a stop. The actual walls (the objects named 'wall') are at positions like 4 steps right, 1 step up. These are wall objects. But without a rule that makes them stop, can I push them?

Wait, the default behavior is that if an object is not defined as stop, you can push it. So if there's a wall object and no ""wall is stop"" rule, I can push it. But in this case, is there a ""wall is stop"" rule?

Looking at the objects:

- There's a 'rule `wall`' at 2 step to the left. This is a text block, not a rule. The active rules are only ""baba is you"". So unless another rule is created that says ""wall is stop"", the wall objects are movable.

But in the current setup, the walls are just there, and I can probably move them. For example, the wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up. If I can get to it, I might be able to push it aside.

But how does that help me reach the 'win' block? The 'win' is at 9 steps right, 1 step up, behind another wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up. If I can move that wall, I could path to the 'win' block.

But to move the wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Assuming I can push it, moving right from my current position (1 left,5 down) towards the wall would require navigating through other objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes 'ball' a win. For example, if I can make 'ball is win', then touching the ball would make me win. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move the 'is' block to be next to 'ball' and 'win', that could work.

But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block. The 'is' blocks are at 1 left,1 up and 7 right,1 up. Let's focus on the one at 7 right,1 up. If I can move that 'is' block down to be next to the ball and the win block.

But how to reach that 'is' block. From my current position, it's quite far. Maybe I need to go through the lower part of the map.

There's a 'rule `is`' at 1 left,5 down, which is adjacent to the 'rule `baba`' and 'rule `you`'. If I can move that 'is' block to somewhere else.

For example, if I move the 'is' at 1 left,5 down to be next to 'baba' and 'win', creating 'baba is win'. But 'win' is at 9 right,1 up, which is far away. Alternatively, maybe create 'you is win', but I'm already 'baba is you'.

Alternatively, use the 'ball' rule. The 'rule `ball`' is at 7 right,3 down. If I can move that 'ball' rule next to 'win' and 'is', making 'ball is win'.

But again, the path is blocked by walls and stops.

Another idea: The 'door' at 7 right,2 down. If I can make a 'key' rule, maybe I can open the door. But there's no key mentioned. Alternatively, if 'baba' can push the door, but doors are usually passable unless there's a rule against it.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', maybe I can push the door. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the 'is' block at 7 right,1 up to be next to 'win' and another noun, creating a new rule like 'win is you' or 'baba is win'.

2. Alternatively, move the 'you' block to be next to a different noun to change the controlling property.

3. Use the ball to create a new rule, like 'ball is win', then touch the ball.

But how to execute these steps.

First, to move the 'is' block at 7 right,1 up. From my current position (1 left,5 down), I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path.

Looking at the wall positions:

- At 4 right,1 up: a wall.
- At 4 right: another wall.
- At 4 right,1 down: a wall.
- At 3 right,2 down: a stop rule.
- Etc.

So moving right from my current position towards the 'is' block at 7 right,1 up is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to find a different path.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block at 1 left,1 up. That's closer. If I can move that 'is' block to be next to 'baba' and 'win', but 'win' is far away.

Wait, the 'is' at 1","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another rule ""is"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the ""is"" rule can be moved? But I have to remember that ""STOP"" objects can't be moved. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, so that's blocking something there.

The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can push the ball, maybe that helps? But how? To push something, I think you have to be adjacent to it and move in the same direction. But right now, I'm not sure where I'm located. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, but since ""baba is you,"" that means I'm at that position. So my current position is 2 steps left and 5 steps down.

Looking around, there's a ""you"" rule at 5 steps down, which aligns with my position because the ""baba is you"" rule is there. So I need to move from my current position (2 left, 5 down) to reach the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. That's a pretty big distance. There are walls blocking the way. The wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up is probably blocking the direct path to the ""win"" rule.

Wait, maybe there are other objects I can interact with. There's a ""door"" at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can reach that door, maybe I can use it to get past the stop or wall. But how? The door's rule is there, but without a ""key"" or something, I don't know if it's openable. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the door a passable object.

The ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can push the ball towards the ""win"" rule, maybe that creates a path. But how do I push it? I need to be adjacent to the ball and move in the direction opposite to where I want it to go. For example, if the ball is to my left, I could move left to push it right. But my current position is 2 left and 5 down. The ball is at 1 right and 1 up from the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 1 up. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to visualize the map.

Let me sketch a rough map based on the observations:

Current position (Baba/You): 2 left, 5 down.

Objects around:
- Rule `is` at 1 step left and 1 step up. So that's northwest of me.
- Ball at 1 step right and 1 step up from the `is` rule. So that's northeast of the `is` rule, which is northwest of me. So the ball is one step east and one step north of my current position.
- Walls at 3 steps right and 1 step up (east of the `is` rule), and others further east and down.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up, which is way to the east. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, so between the ball and the win rule, there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. Then another rule `is` at 8 right, 1 up, which might be part of a new rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is south of the wall. So that's blocking movement south from the wall.

The ""door"" is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, which is southeast of the stop rule. The ball is at 7 right and 3 steps down? Wait, no—the ball is at 7 right and 3 steps down? Let me check again.

The ball's position is 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down from where? The observation says ""rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" Wait, no, looking back:

Objects on the map include:

- rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `ball` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So the ball is at 8 right, 3 down. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. So the ball is below the door.

The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. So to get there, I need to go east past several walls. But maybe there's a way to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows passage.

Since ""baba is you,"" I can pick up and move text blocks that are not STOP. The ""is"" rules are movable, I think. So if I can move the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up, maybe I can change a rule. For example, if I create ""win is ball,"" then touching the ball would make me win. But how to do that?

First, I need to reach the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up blocking the path. The wall is a solid object, so I can't go through it. Unless I can push it, but the wall's rule is ""wall is wall,"" and I don't see a way to make it movable. Also, the ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 2 down might block movement there.

Alternative approach: Maybe use the ball to break the wall. If I push the ball into the wall, maybe it destroys the wall? But in Baba Is You, usually pushing objects into walls doesn't destroy them unless there's a specific rule allowing it. Since the current rules are ""baba is you,"" and nothing about destroying walls, probably not.

Another idea:change the ""win"" rule to be the ball. So if I can create a rule ""win is ball,"" then touching the ball would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and ""win"" text blocks. But where are the text blocks?

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is a separate object at 9 right, 1 up. The ""ball"" rule is at 8 right, 3 down. The ""is"" rules are at 1 left,1 up and 7 right,1 up. So to make ""win is ball,"" I need to have the ""is"" rule between ""win"" and ""ball."" But they are far apart.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" from 7 right,1 up to be next to ""ball"" and ""win."" But the distance is too great. The ""is"" at 7 right,1 up is one step left of the ""win"" at 8 right,1 up. So if I can move that ""is"" rule to the position of the ""ball"" rule at 8 right,3 down, then I could create a new rule. But moving from 7 right,1 up to 8 right,3 down requires moving right and down, but there are obstacles like walls and the stop rule.

Alternatively, maybe push the ""is"" rule using the ball. If I push the ball towards the ""is"" rule, maybe I can reposition it. But the ball is at 8 right,3 down, and the ""is"" is at 7 right,1 up. Not sure.

Wait, my current position is 2 left,5 down. The ""is"" rule I can move is at 7 right,1 up. To get there, I need to move right 9 steps (from 2 left to 7 right would be 9 steps right?), but there are walls blocking the way. The wall at 3 right,1 up is a problem. Maybe I can find a path around it.

Looking at the map, from my current position (2 left,5 down), moving right would take me towards the wall at 3 right,1 up. But that's up and to the right. Maybe I can go down first? There's a wall at 3 right,3 down. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe interact with the ""door"" at 7 right,2 down. If I can push the door, maybe it opens? But again, no rules about opening doors.

Wait, the ""door"" is a rule at 8 right,2 down. If I can create a ""door is you"" rule, then stepping on the door would make me you, but that might not help. Alternatively, ""open is door"" or something, but there's no ""open"" rule here.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up to create a new rule.
2. Use the ""is"" rule to make ""win is ball,"" allowing touching the ball to win.
3. Navigate to the ball at 8 right,3 down, possibly pushing it or moving around.

But how to reach the ""is"" rule? The path is blocked by walls. Maybe move the walls by pushing them, but they are ""wall is wall,"" which are likely immovable unless there's a rule allowing it.

Alternatively, maybe change the ""wall"" rule to something else. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left (relative to where?) and 1 step to the left of the current position. Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 step to the left. So that's 2 steps left from where? Probably from the initial position, but the exact coordinates are a bit unclear.

Wait, the observation says ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left."" Assuming this is relative to Baba's position. So Baba is at 2 left,5 down. The ""wall"" rule is 2 steps to the left from Baba, so that's 4 left,5 down. But there's also a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe the coordinates are absolute?

This is confusing. Maybe I need to focus on actionable steps. Since I'm Baba and can move, perhaps the best bet is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up, but avoiding walls. Let's see:

From current position (2 left,5 down), moving right 5 steps would get to 3 left,5 down. Then down to avoid the wall at 3 right,1 up? Not sure. Alternatively, move up first. If I move up from 2 left,5 down, I go to 2 left,4 down. Then right to 1 left,4 down. Then right again to 0 (center),4 down. But there's a wall at 3 right,1 up, which is east of the center. Maybe this path is blocked.

Alternatively, move down to 2 left,6 down, then right to avoid the wall. But this is getting too vague without a clear map.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 8 right,3 down. If I can push it towards the ""win"" at 9 right,1 up, maybe creating a path. But the ball is at 8 right,3 down. To get to it, I need to move right and down. From my current position (2 left,5 down), moving right 10 steps would reach 8 right, but there are walls at 3 right,1 up and others. Alternatively, move down to 2 left,6 down, then right to 1 left,6 down, then right to center (0,6 down), then right to 1 right,6 down, then up to 1 right,5 down, etc. This is risky because of the walls.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up to create a new rule. For example, if I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""you,"" maybe make ""you is ball,"" making the ball controllable. But I need to get to that ""is"" rule.

Perhaps the key is to move the ""is"" rule from 7 right,1 up to be adjacent to ""ball"" and ""you."" Let's see:

The ""is"" rule is at 7 right,1 up. The ""ball"" rule is at 8 right,3 down. The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. To move the ""is"" rule to 8 right,3 down, I need to move it right and down. But how? I would have to pick up the ""is"" rule and drag it. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move text blocks that are not STOP. The ""is"" rule is not STOP, so I can move it.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the position of the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to be next to the ""ball"" rule at 8 right,3 down.
3. Create a new rule like ""win is ball"" or ""ball is win,"" allowing touching the ball to win.

But how to navigate there? Let's break it down step by step.

Current position: 2 left,5 down.

To reach the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up:

- Move right 9 steps (from 2 left to 7 right is 9 steps right).
- Then move up 4 steps (from 5 down to 1 up).

But along the way, there's a wall at 3 right,1 up. So moving right from 2 left to 3 right would hit the wall at 3 right,1 up. That's a problem. Unless I can move around it.

Alternative path: Move down first, then right, then up.

From current position (2 left,5 down):

1. Move down to 2 left,6 down.
2. Move right to 1 left,6 down.
3. Move right to 0 (center),6 down.
4. Move right to 1 right,6 down.
5. Move right to 2 right,6 down.
6. Move right to 3 right,6 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down? Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down is actually at 3 right,1 down from where? Maybe relative to another point. This is getting too confusing without a clear coordinate system.

Alternatively, look for movable objects nearby. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule. So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can create a new rule.

But to do that, I need to reach the ""is"" rule. Maybe use the ball to push the ""is"" rule. If I move the ball towards the ""is"" rule, maybe I can reposition it. The ball is at 8 right,3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right,1 up. Not sure if they are adjacent.

Alternatively, focus on changing the ""win"" rule to be the ball. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right,1 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule from 7 right,1 up to be next to ""win"" and ""ball,"" then create ""win is ball.""

But the distance is too great. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 7 right,1 up is adjacent to the ""win"" rule at 8 right,1 up. If I move that ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be at 8 right,1 up, next to the ""win"" rule. Then I could create ""win is [something]."" But what's at 8 right,1 up? The ""win"" rule. So if I move the ""is"" there, I could make ""win is [another object].""

But the current ""is"" rule is at 7 right,1 up. If I move it to 8 right,1 up, adjacent to ""win,"" then I can create a new rule by placing it next to another object. For example, if there's a ""ball"" nearby, I could make ""win is ball.""

But where is the ""ball""? It's at 8 right,3 down. So not in the same area.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""you"" and ""ball."" The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, which is below the current position. The ""ball"" is at 8 right,3 down. Maybe not.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ball towards the ""win"" rule. For example, if the ball is pushed into the ""win"" area, but there's a wall blocking the way.

Alternatively, change the ""wall"" rule to something else. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then the path might be clear. But ""wall is wall"" is a strong rule, and moving it might not be possible unless there's a specific rule allowing it.

Another idea: Use the ""door"" rule. If I can make a rule like ""door is you,"" then stepping on the door would make me you, but I'm already you. Not helpful. Or ""key is ball,"" but there's no key.

Wait, the ball is a separate object. If I can make the ball a ""win"" by creating ""win is ball,"" then touching the ball would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to both ""win"" and ""ball.""

The ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up. The ""ball"" is at 8 right,3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 7 right,1 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule down to 8 right,3 down, adjacent to both ""win"" and ""ball,"" but that's a big move.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule from 7 right,1 up to 8 right,2 up (between ""win"" and ""door""), then create ""win is ball"" by placing the ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""ball."" But the ball is three steps down from there.

This seems impossible without being able to move the ""is"" rule multiple steps down and right, which is blocked by walls.

Maybe the solution is simpler. Since I'm Baba and can move, perhaps I need to reach the ""win"" rule directly. But the path","

I need to figure out how to get to the win condition in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current active rules and the objects on the map.

The active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move Baba around. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but right now the win is positioned at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, which blocks the direct path. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down, which makes those objects immovable.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Maybe I can manipulate the rules by moving this text block to create new rules. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right, 1 up, but there's a wall there. Maybe I can change the ""win"" to something else, like making Baba the win by creating a new rule ""baba is win"". 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule block that's at 7 steps right, 1 step up. If I can get to that ""is"" block and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"", I can change the win condition. But how do I get there? The path is blocked by walls and a stop. Let's check the movement options.

Baba's position isn't explicitly stated here, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move right, I can reach the wall at 3 steps right, 1 up. Wait, but there's a ball at 1 step right and 1 step up. Maybe I can push the ball? But the ball's properties aren't defined, so unless there's a rule allowing me to push it, I might not be able to. The current rules only say ""baba is you"", so maybe I can push the ball if it's not stopped. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the text blocks to create a new rule. The ""is"" block at 7 steps right, 1 up could be moved to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" elsewhere. But to do that, I need to move that ""is"" block. But how? The path to it is blocked by walls. There's a ""stop"" at 3 steps right, 2 steps down, which might prevent movement through that area. 

Wait, maybe there's a door at 7 steps right, 2 steps down. If I can open the door, maybe that path becomes passable. But to open a door, usually you need a key or to change the rule. Since there's no key mentioned, perhaps changing the door's rule to something else. For example, if I can make the door a ""win"" or remove its ""stop"" property. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba into a ""stop"" to bypass obstacles, but that would negate my ability to move. Not helpful. Another approach: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can move other objects if they aren't stopped. The ball isn't defined as stop, so maybe I can push it. If I push the ball towards the ""is"" block at 7 steps right, maybe I can use it to move other objects. But the ball's position is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move right, I hit the wall at 3 steps right, 1 up. 

Wait, maybe I need to go down. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and ""you"" at 5 steps down. If I can create a rule like ""baba is win"" by moving those text blocks. For example, if I move the ""is"" at 5 steps down to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"", that could work. But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the layout, moving down from the initial position might be possible. Let's say I'm at the starting position near the top-left. Moving left from there would take me to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I go down from there, I can reach the area with the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 steps down, which might block movement. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""door"" at 7 steps right, 2 steps down. If I can change the door's rule to ""win"", then going through the door would be the solution. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to that door's location and set it to ""win"". 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Current rules: Baba can move.
- Win is at 9 right, 1 up, behind a wall.
- There's an ""is"" block at 7 right, 1 up. If I can move that to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"", making ""baba is win"".
- To move the ""is"" block, I need path clear. The area around it has walls and a stop at 3 right, 2 down. Maybe I need to remove the stop first. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. If I can change that to something else, like removing ""stop"" from that object. For example, creating a rule ""stop is nothing"" or moving the ""stop"" text block away. But how? 

Alternatively, if I can make Baba a ""stop"", then I could push the stop block, but that would stop me from moving. Not ideal. 

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 5 steps down. If I can make ""you"" into ""win"", then reaching that spot would be the solution. But ""you"" is already a rule, so changing it to ""win"" would require moving the ""you"" text block and creating a new rule. 

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you"". So Baba is both the player and the ""you"" object. If I can change the ""you"" to ""win"", then touching the ""you"" area would make me win. But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. If I move that ""you"" block to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"", maybe ""baba is win"". 

But how to move the blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and move in a direction. Let's assume I'm near the top-left ""is"" block. Moving right towards the wall at 3 right, 1 up. But there's a ball there. Can I push the ball? Since there's no rule against it, maybe. If I push the ball right, it would move to 2 right, 1 up. Then I can move past it. But the wall is still at 3 right, 1 up. Unless the ball can be used to block the wall, but walls are solid. 

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used to create a new rule. If I can get the ""is"" block at 7 right, 1 up and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" somewhere else. For example, move the ""is"" block to 8 right, 1 up (where the win is) and place ""baba"" and ""win"" there. But the win is at 9 right, 1 up. Hmm. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to push the ""is"" block at 7 right, 1 up towards the win location. To do that, I need to move left from where I am. Let's say I'm at the top-left ""is"" block (1 left, 1 up). Moving right twice would get me to the ball at 1 right, 1 up. Then push the ball right to 2 right, 1 up. Now I can move right past the ball to 3 right, 1 up, which is a wall. Can't go further. 

Alternatively, move down from the top-left ""is"" block to the area at 1 left, 5 down. There's another ""is"" block and ""you"" rule. Maybe combine those. If I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block from 1 left, 5 down with ""baba"" and ""win"". But where is the ""win"" object? It's at 9 right, 1 up. That's far away. 

Wait, perhaps I can create a rule that makes any Baba a win. For example, ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to have the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" text blocks. If I can move the ""is"" block from 7 right, 1 up to be between ""baba"" and ""win"", but the win is far away. 

Alternatively, use the ""door"" at 7 right, 2 down. If I can change the door to a win, then going through it would win. To do that, create ""door is win"". But I need the ""is"" block for that. 

I think the key is to reach the ""is"" block at 7 right, 1 up and move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"". But the path is blocked. Maybe I need to remove the wall at 4 right, 1 up. How? If I can change the wall's rule. For example, ""wall is nothing"", but there's a rule ""wall is wall"" at 1 step left. Maybe moving that ""wall"" rule away. 

The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step left. If I can move that ""wall"" text block, then the wall at 4 right, 1 up might no longer be a wall. But how to move the ""wall"" text block? I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at the top-left, moving left to 2 left, then down to 2 left, 5 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 5 down. This is getting too complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since ""baba is you"", and there's a ""rule `is`"" block nearby, maybe I can create a new rule by moving that ""is"" block with other objects. For example, move the ""is"" block to 1 left, 5 down where the ""you"" rule is, to make ""baba is you win"" or something. But the syntax needs to be ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So to make ""baba is win"", I need ""baba"" ""is"" ""win"" in adjacent blocks. 

If I can move the ""is"" block from 7 right, 1 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""baba"" is a rule block at 2 left, 5 down. ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. Not adjacent. 

Wait, maybe there's a different approach. The ""ball"" is at 1 right, 1 up. If I can push the ball to create a path. For example, push the ball right to 2 right, 1 up, then I can move right past it to 3 right, 1 up (wall). Not helpful. 

Alternatively, use the ball to move other blocks. But I don't see other movable blocks except the text rules. 

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" blocks can be moved if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that object, then maybe I can move through. To remove ""stop"", I need to break the rule ""stop is stop"" or change it. But how? 

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""stop"". For example, ""stop is you"", making stops movable. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to create that rule. 

This is really challenging. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 7 right, 1 up to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"".
   - To do this, need to path to the ""is"" block at 7 right, 1 up.
   - But the path is blocked by walls and a stop at 3 right, 2 down.

2. Alternatively, use the ""door"" at 7 right, 2 down. Create a rule ""door is win"" by moving the ""is"" block there.
   - Then go through the door to win.

3. Another option: Change the ""win"" location to where I am. For example, ""win is baba"", making touching Baba win.
   - But ""win"" is a rule block at 9 right, 1 up. Need to move that ""win"" block next to Baba.

4. Or, make ""you"" into ""win"". Since ""baba is you"", changing ""you"" to ""win"" would make touching Baba win.
   - The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down. Move that ""you"" block next to ""win"".

But how to access those areas? Let's focus on step 2: using the door. The door is at 7 right, 2 down. There's a ""rule `is`"" block at 1 left, 5 down. If I can move that ""is"" block to the door's location and set it to ""win"", then the door becomes win. 

To move the ""is"" block from 1 left, 5 down to 7 right, 2 down, I need a path. The way might be blocked by walls. From 1 left, 5 down, moving right would require navigating around walls. There's a wall at 3 right, 5 down. Maybe push it? But the wall is stopped by a ""stop"" rule at 2 right, 2 down. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ball to reveal a path or to use the ""is"" blocks to create ""baba is win"". 

Another thought: The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, 1 left is nearby. If I can create ""baba is win"" by moving that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""baba"" is a rule block at 2 left, 5 down, which is far from the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. 

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move the ""win"" rule block to be next to Baba. Since ""baba is you"", if I can move the ""win"" block to where I am, then touching it would win. But how? The ""win"" block is at 9 right, 1 up. To move it, I need to adjacent to it and push it, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. Unless I can remove the wall's rule. 

The wall's rule is at 2 left. If I can move that ""wall"" rule block away, then the wall at 4 right, 1 up becomes just a regular wall (maybe not?). Wait, the rule ""wall is wall"" is at 2 left. If I remove that rule, then the wall's property changes. But how? 

To remove a rule, I need to break the text block. For example, if the rule is ""wall is wall"", breaking that would make the wall no longer a wall. But in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks around, but you can't delete them unless you override the rule. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is simpler. Since Baba is you, and there's a ""rule `is`"" nearby, create ""baba is win"" by moving that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". 

Assuming I'm near the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up. Move down to 1 left, 5 down where the ""is"" and ""you"" rules are. Then, move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" (which is a rule block at 2 left, 5 down) and ""win"" (at 9 right, 1 up). But those are too far apart. 

Wait, maybe there's a different ""win"" rule. The active rules only show ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. 

Alternative approach: Use the ball to create a path. If I can push the ball into the wall, but walls are solid. Or maybe use the ball to block a stop? 

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the correct action is to move right towards the ball and push it, creating a path. So the action would be ""right"".

Let's tackle this Baba Is You level. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move and interact with objects by pushing them if they're not stopped. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is a door at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up.

Looking at the map, there's a ""rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up."" But between me (Baba) and the door, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. The wall is also defined by a ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left,"" which probably means that wherever that ""wall"" rule is placed, it creates a wall. 

I see a ""rule `is` 2 step to the left and 1 step up."" Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to change what the wall does. If I can change ""wall"" to something else, maybe the wall becomes movable or disappears. Let me check the positions:

- My position: Probably where the ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"" is. Wait, no, the active rules say ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. Looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 5 down, but the actual Baba is likely the one controlled by me. Maybe the ""rule `baba`"" text block is separate.

The ""rule `is` 2 step to the left and 1 step up"" is a text block that says ""is."" If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule, maybe I can recombine them. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 steps left. If I move the ""is"" to the left of the ""wall"" rule, it would become ""wall IS [something else]."" But where is the ""something else""?

Looking at the objects, there's a ball at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can rearrange the text blocks to make ""ball is win"" or ""baba is win,"" that could change the win condition. Alternatively, making ""wall is stop"" might not help since walls are already stopping.

Wait, the door is at 6 steps right and 2 steps down, but the ""win"" rule is at 7 right and 1 up. Maybe the door is a different win condition, but the active rule is ""win"" at 7 right up. So I need to get past the wall at 2 right up.

If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, changing it to ""wall is [something]."" For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then walls could be pushed. But I need to see if there's a way to do that. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left and 1 up. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. If I move the ""is"" to the left of the ""wall"" rule, combining them into ""wall is [something]."" But what's adjacent to the ""is"" rule?

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" rule near the ""ball"" to make ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win object. Then I can push the ball to the win spot. Let's see: the ball is at 1 left and 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left and 1 up. If I move right to get to the ball's position, but there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up. Wait, the wall is at 2 right and 1 up, which is blocking the path. So maybe I need to remove that wall's rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left of the ""wall"" rule, making it ""wall is [something else]."" For example, if I make ""wall is stop,"" but walls are already stop. Alternatively, ""wall is you,"" but that would make walls controllable. Wait, if ""baba is you,"" and I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become me, so I could turn into a wall and maybe pass through? Not sure.

Alternatively, create a ""you"" rule for the ball. The ""you"" rule is at 1 left and 5 down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to the ball's location, then the ball becomes the you object, and I can push it to the win spot. But how to get there?

My current position: Looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left and 5 down. That's probably where I am. To get to the ""you"" rule at 1 left and 5 down, I need to move left. But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

From my position (3 left, 5 down), moving left would take me to 2 left, 5 down. Is there a wall there? Yes, a wall at 2 steps to the right and 5 down. Wait, the wall is at 2 steps to the right and 5 down, which is 3 left (since right is negative left?). Maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me visualize:

Assuming the grid is relative. If I'm at 3 left and 5 down, moving left would be further left. The wall at 2 steps to the right and 5 down would be to my right. So to get to the ""you"" rule at 1 left and 5 down, I need to move left once. But is that path clear? The ""rule `is`"" is at 2 left and 5 down, which is between me and the ""you"" rule. So I can move left past the ""is"" rule to reach the ""you"" rule.

Once I have the ""you"" rule next to the ball, I can push the ball to the win spot. But first, I need to move the ""is"" rule that's blocking the path to the ""you"" rule.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule at 2 left and 1 up to somewhere else to combine with other rules. For example, moving it to the ball's location (1 left, 1 up) to make ""ball is win."" Then push the ball to the win spot at 7 right, 1 up.

Let me try that plan:

1. Move from my position (3 left, 5 down) to the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 1 up. But wait, how do I navigate there? Maybe move up first.

Current position: Assuming ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left and 5 down, which is my location. To get to the ""is"" rule at 2 left and 1 up, I need to move up 4 steps and left 1 step. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the objects between me and the ""is"" rule.

Looking at the objects:

- At 2 left, 1 up: rule `is`
- Between me (3 left,5 down) and that ""is"" rule, moving up would go through:
  - 3 left,4 down: no object
  - 3 left,3 down: wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down? Wait, the wall is at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down relative to where? Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think in terms of relative movements.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" to create ""ball is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule (2 left,1 up) to the right and down to reach the ball's position (1 left,1 up). So move the ""is"" rule one step to the right (to 1 left,1 up) and then perhaps down? But how do I move the text blocks?

In Baba Is You, to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction, pushing it if possible. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, so I can push it.

So, from my position (3 left,5 down), I need to get to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up. Let's see:

- Move up 4 steps to get to 3 left,1 down. But wait, the ""is"" rule is at 2 left,1 up. So maybe first move left once to 2 left,5 down, then up 4 steps to 2 left,1 down. Wait, the ""is"" is at 2 left,1 up, so perhaps the coordinates are a bit different. This is tricky without a visual map.

Alternatively, focus on the key objects. The ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up. The wall blocks the direct path. The ""is"" rule is nearby. If I can make ""wall is push,"" then I could push the wall aside. To do that, I need to combine the ""wall"" rule with ""is push.""

The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left,1 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule to the left of the ""wall"" rule, making it ""wall is push."" Then, since walls can be pushed, I can move them out of the way.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up.
2. Push it to the left (toward the ""wall"" rule at 3 left).
3. Combine them into ""wall is push.""
4. Then push the wall at 2 right,1 up (which is now pushable) to the right, clearing the path to the ""win"" door.

Alternatively, make the ball the win condition. To do that, move the ""is"" rule next to the ball. The ball is at 1 left,1 up. So move the ""is"" rule from 2 left,1 up to 1 left,1 up (push it left), creating ""ball is win."" Then push the ball to the ""win"" location.

Either approach could work. Let's try the ball as win first because it's closer.

To move the ""is"" rule to the ball's position:

- The ""is"" is at 2 left,1 up. The ball is at 1 left,1 up. So I need to push the ""is"" rule one step to the left.

To push it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I'm pushing. So if I'm to the right of the ""is"" rule (at 2 left,1 up), I can move left to push it further left to 1 left,1 up.

But where am I currently? My position is at the ""rule `baba`"" which is at 3 left,5 down. To get to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up, I need to move up and left.

Let me outline the path:

Current position: 3 left,5 down.

Move left once to 2 left,5 down. Is there an object there? The ""rule `is`"" is at 2 left,1 up, not here. There's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 5 down, which is 3 left (my position) minus 2 right would be 1 left. So maybe that's not blocking.

Then move up from 2 left,5 down to 2 left,4 down, 2 left,3 down, 2 left,2 down, 2 left,1 down, then finally 2 left,1 up (the ""is"" rule). So moving up four steps and left once.

Once there, I can push the ""is"" rule left by moving right (since pushing requires moving in the opposite direction). Wait, to push an object, you have to move towards it. For example, to push the ""is"" rule to the left, I need to move right towards it, pushing it left.

So from my position at 2 left,1 up (the ""is"" rule's location), I need to move right to push it further left. But I'm already at the ""is"" rule. Wait, maybe I need to be adjacent to it. Let me think.

If the ""is"" rule is at 2 left,1 up, and I want to push it to 1 left,1 up, I need to be to the right of it (at 1 left,1 up) and move left, pushing it. But I'm currently at 3 left,5 down. This is getting complicated without a visual.

Alternative approach: Since the ""you"" rule is at 1 left,5 down, maybe I can move that to the ball. Let's see:

Current ""you"" rule is at 1 left,5 down. The ball is at 1 left,1 up. If I can move the ""you"" rule up to the ball's position, then the ball becomes ""you,"" and I can push it to the win spot.

To move the ""you"" rule: I need to be adjacent to it. My position is 3 left,5 down. To reach the ""you"" rule at 1 left,5 down, I need to move left twice (to 2 left,5 down then 1 left,5 down). But the path is blocked by a ""rule `is`"" at 2 left,5 down. So I have to move around that.

So steps:

1. Move from 3 left,5 down to 2 left,5 down (left once).
2. The ""rule `is`"" is at 2 left,5 down. I can push it? Since ""baba is you,"" and ""is"" isn't stopped, yes. To push the ""is"" rule, I need to move in the direction opposite to where I'm pushing. So if I want to push it to the right (toward me), I need to move left towards it. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, to move the ""is"" rule at 2 left,5 down to the right (to 3 left,5 down), I would stand next to it and move right, pushing it. But I'm already at 3 left,5 down (my position), which is to the right of the ""is"" rule. So if I move right from my position, I would push the ""is"" rule to 3 left,5 down, which is where I am. That doesn't help.

Alternatively, move left to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,5 down, then move left again to push it further left. Wait, but I can only move one step at a time. Let me think:

- I'm at 3 left,5 down.
- Move left to 2 left,5 down (adjacent to the ""is"" rule).
- Now, to push the ""is"" rule left (to 1 left,5 down), I need to move right (since pushing requires moving towards the object). So move right from 2 left,5 down to 3 left,5 down, pushing the ""is"" rule to 1 left,5 down.

But then the ""is"" rule is now at 1 left,5 down, right next to the ""you"" rule. Then I can combine them into ""you is [something]."" Wait, the ""you"" rule is ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 5 steps down."" If I move the ""is"" rule to the left of the ""you"" rule, making ""you is [something],"" but what's the something? The ball is at 1 left,1 up, not here.

This might not be the right path. Let's go back to the original idea of making the ball the win condition.

To do that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule (2 left,1 up) to the ball's location (1 left,1 up).
2. Combine them into ""ball is win.""
3. Push the ball to the win spot at 7 right,1 up.

To move the ""is"" rule:

- I need to be adjacent to it. My position is 3 left,5 down. To get to 2 left,1 up, move up 4 steps and left 1 step.
- Once there, push the ""is"" rule left by moving right. So from 2 left,1 up, move right to 3 left,1 up, pushing the ""is"" rule to 1 left,1 up.

Now, the ""is"" rule is at 1 left,1 up, next to the ball. This creates ""ball is win,"" changing the win condition to the ball.

Then, I can push the ball from its current position (1 left,1 up) to the ""win"" location at 7 right,1 up. But there's a wall at 2 right,1 up. However, if I made ""wall is push"" earlier, I could move it. Alternatively, since the ball is now the win object, maybe I just need to reach it, but the win rule is at 7 right,1 up, which is a door. So I need to get the ball there.

To push the ball:

- The ball is at 1 left,1 up. The path to the win spot is blocked by a wall at 2 right,1 up. If I can make the wall pushable, I can move it aside.

To make the wall pushable, I need to change its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it, making ""wall is push.""

But the ""is"" rule is now at 1 left,1 up. To get it to 3 left (next to the ""wall"" rule), I would have to move it there, but that's a long way. Alternatively, use another ""is"" rule. Wait, there's another ""is"" rule at 7 steps right and 1 step up, but that's probably part of the ""win"" rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move freely unless stopped. The win is a door at 7 right,1 up. To get there, I need to pass through the wall at 2 right,1 up. But the wall is stopped by a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down, which is below the wall.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So if I push the wall at 2 right,1 up past the stop, but the stop is below. Maybe the wall is not stopped, because the ""stop"" rule is at a different position. Let me check:

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. The wall we","

I need to figure out how to move in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current state.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever Baba does, I can do. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but that might be changed. Let me look at the objects on the map.

There's a ""rule `is`"" two steps to the left and one up. Then a ball left and up, a wall two steps right and up. Another ""rule `is`"" six steps right and up, ""win"" seven steps right and up, a wall three steps left, more walls, a ""stop"" rule at one right and two down, a door six right and two down, a ball there too, and so on. Down at five steps down, there's a ""rule `baba`"" three steps left, another ""is"" two left, and ""you"" one left, with a wall right.

Hmm. So, my goal is probably to get to the ""win"" which is seven steps right and up. But there's a wall three steps left and walls blocking the path. Also, there's a ""stop"" at one right and two down, which means I can't push past that. The door six right and two down might be a way through if I can interact with it.

Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move around. But the walls are ""wall"" which are probably solid unless rules change. The ""stop"" makes objects immovable. Maybe I can move the text blocks to change the rules.

Looking at the ""rule `is`"" blocks. If I can move them to create new rules, like ""win is you"" or ""baba is win,"" that might help. But how to move them? I need to be adjacent to a text block and not blocked by a ""stop"" or ""wall.""

Currently, I think my position is inferred from the ""rule `baba`"" at three left and five down. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is an object that defines Baba's position? Or is Baba a separate object? Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually represented by the Baba object. So, maybe the ""rule `baba`"" at three left and five down is indicating where Baba is located. So, I need to move that Baba to the ""win"" position.

But how? The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so moving Baba means I can move him directly. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop. Let's see the layout.

From the observation, the walls are at positions that might form a grid. The ""win"" is seven steps right and up from the ""rule `is`"" at two left and one up. Maybe the map is laid out with steps in a grid. Let me try to visualize:

- Starting at the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left, 5 down. So, if I move right, I can go towards the ""win."" But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 down. So, can't go straight right from there. Maybe need to navigate around.

Alternatively, perhaps moving the text blocks to change the rules. The ""rule `is`"" at two left and one up. If I can move that to create a new rule, like ""baba is win,"" then I would become the win. Let's see.

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a STOP or WALL. The ""rule `is`"" at two left and one up: where is that located relative to me? If I'm at 3 left, 5 down, then two left and one up would be three left minus two steps left? Wait, directions might be confusing. Let's clarify:

Assuming that ""2 step to the left"" means my position is two steps left from some reference point, but in the game, directions are relative. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, think of the map as a grid where each object has coordinates.

Alternatively, focus on actionable steps. The key is to either reach the win object or change the rules so that I become the win. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move freely, but need to avoid walls and stops.

The ""stop"" at 1 right and 2 down: that's a wall I can't push through. The door at 6 right and 2 down might be opened if I have a key, but there's no key mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used to interact with the door. If the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" then pushing a ball into it might not help. But if I can change the door's rule, like ""door is you,"" then stepping on it would win.

But how to do that? Let me look at the text blocks. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 6 right and 1 up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the door's rule, I could create ""door is you."" But I need to reach that ""is"" block.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at two left and one up. If I can move that to the door's position, combining with ""door"" to make ""door is you."" Let's see:

Current ""rule `is`"" is at 2 left, 1 up. If I move right towards the center, maybe I can reach it. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's check the path from my position (3 left, 5 down) to the ""rule `is`"" at 2 left, 1 up.

To get there, I need to move left and up. But moving left from 3 left would take me to 4 left, but there's a wall at 3 step to the left (rule `wall` 3 step to the left). Wait, the wall is at 3 step to the left—does that mean three steps left from Baba's position? If Baba is at 3 left, 5 down, then a wall at 3 step to the left would be 3 + 3 = 6 left? That might be outside the current view. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the walls are arranged such that moving left from Baba's position is blocked by a wall. Let me try to map this out step by step.

Baba's position: rule `baba` is at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. So, assuming that's the player's position, the coordinates might be relative. Let's consider the grid as follows:

- x-axis (left/right)
- y-axis (up/down)

Baba is at (x=-3, y=-5) perhaps. Then the ""rule `is`"" at 2 step to the left and 1 step up would be (x=-5, y=-4). The ball is at 1 step left and 1 up: (x=-4, y=-4). The wall at 2 steps right and 1 up: (x=+2, y=-4). 

The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 1 up: (x=+8, y=-4). That's far to the right. There's a wall at 3 steps left: (x=-6, y=-5) maybe. 

The ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down: (x=+1, y=-6). The door is at 6 steps right and 2 down: (x=+6, y=-6). The ball there too: (x=+6, y=-5). 

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 step left and 5 down: (x=-6, y=-10)? Not sure. This is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to focus on movement.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move in the four directions. The immediate goal is to reach the ""win,"" but it's blocked. Let's see if there's a way around.

Looking at the objects:

- To the left of Baba: there's a wall at 3 step left. So moving left from Baba's position is blocked.
- To the right: there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 up, but maybe there's a path down. Let's check the wall positions.

The wall at 2 steps right is probably in the same row as the ""rule `is`"" up there. But the path down from there might be blocked by the ""stop"" at 1 right and 2 down. 

Alternatively, the door at 6 right and 2 down. If I can get to that area, maybe I can push the door or change its rule. But to get there, I need to navigate past the walls and stop.

Another idea: use the ball to interact with objects. For example, if the door is ""door is stop,"" pushing a ball into it might not do anything. But if I can make the door ""you"" or ""win,"" then stepping on it would work.

To change the door's rule, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to it. The ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that ""is"" down to the door's position (6 right, 2 down), then I can create ""door is [something]."" 

But how to get there? The path from my current position (assuming I'm at 3 left,5 down) to 6 right, 2 down would involve moving right, down, and then right again. But there are walls in the way. Let's see:

From 3 left,5 down:

- Move right: but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 up. Wait, maybe the walls are in different positions. This is getting too confusing without a visual. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" text block first.

The ""rule `is`"" at 2 left and 1 up. If I can move that to the door's position, combining with ""door"" to make ""door is you."" To move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and able to push it past any stops or walls.

Assuming the ""is"" block is at 2 left, 1 up relative to me. So, to reach it, I need to move left and up. But there's a wall at 3 step left, which may block that path. Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged such that moving left from my position is blocked by the wall at 3 step left.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to move the ""is"" block by using the ball as a lever. If I can push the ball into the ""is"" block, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. In Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not STOP, and you can move text blocks if they're not STOP.

Another angle: the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move that ""you"" rule to another position to create a new rule. For example, moving ""you"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is you.""

But how to reach that ""you"" rule? It's at 1 right,5 down. From my position (3 left,5 down), that's two steps to the right. But there's a wall at 2 steps right (from the observation: wall 2 steps to the right). So moving right from my position to reach the ""you"" rule is blocked by the wall.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe I need to find a path around the walls. Let's consider moving down to avoid the walls up above.

From my current position (3 left,5 down), moving down might lead to areas without walls. Let's see:

There's a ""stop"" at 1 right and 2 down. So if I move right twice and down once, I might reach that stop. But the stop makes objects immovable, so I can't push through.

Alternatively, look for a way to use the ball. The ball is at 1 left and 1 up. If I can move the ball into the ""win"" position, but the win is far to the right. Not sure.

Wait, the ""ball"" at 1 left and 1 up is near the ""rule `is`"" at 2 left and 1 up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to the ball's position to create ""ball is you"" or something. But the goal is win, not ball.

Alternatively, create ""win is you"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""win."" The ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 1 up. The ""is"" block is at 6 steps right and 1 up. So if I can move the ""is"" one step right, it would be next to ""win,"" making ""win is [something]."" If I can make it ""win is you,"" then reaching the win would make me win.

To move the ""is"" block at 6 right,1 up to 7 right,1 up (next to win), I need to push it right. But is there a path? The area around there has a wall at 2 steps right and 1 up (the other ""wall"" mentioned). Wait, the wall is at 2 steps right and 1 up, which is probably between the ""is"" block and the ""win."" So moving the ""is"" block right would be blocked by the wall.

Hmm. This is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to try moving the ""is"" block that's at 2 left,1 up to the door's position. Let's see:

The ""is"" block is at 2 left,1 up. The door is at 6 right,2 down. That's a significant distance. To move the ""is"" block there, I'd have to push it past several steps, but there are walls and stops in between. Probably not feasible.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" is at 1 right,5 down. If I can move that to the ""win"" position, making ""win is you."" To do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule right and up. But again, path blocked by walls.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right,5 down. The ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up. That's a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Another idea: use the ball to push objects. For example, if I can push the ball into the ""is"" block, then maybe relocate the ""is"" block. But I'm not sure if that's allowed. In Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not STOP. The ball is not STOP, so maybe I can push it.

The ball is at 1 left,1 up. If I push it right, it might move into the ""is"" block at 2 left,1 up, making them adjacent. Then I could move the combined block further. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ball's position, then push them together. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say.

Maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the ""win"" and see if I can change the rule on the way. For example, if I can create ""baba is win"" by moving an ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But where is Baba's position? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 step left and 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" but that seems distant.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can just move to the ""win"" object and declare ""win is you"" by moving the ""is"" next to them.

But the ""win"" is far away. Let's think step by step.

Current position: near the ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left,5 down.

Possible moves:

1. Move right: blocked by wall at 2 steps right.
2. Move left: blocked by wall at 3 steps left.
3. Move up: there's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 left,1 up. If I move up two steps and left one, I can reach it. But is the path clear?

From current position (3 left,5 down), moving up one step would be to 3 left,4 down. Then left one step to 4 left,4 down. Is there a wall there? The observation mentions a wall at 2 step to the left, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the wall at 3 step to the left might be in another direction.

This is really challenging without seeing the actual grid. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" block first. Let's assume the ""is"" block at 2 left,1 up is to the northwest of me. If I move northwest, can I reach it?

Moving left from 3 left to 4 left (one step left), then up from 5 down to 4 down (one step up). Is that possible? If there's no wall there, then yes. But if there's a wall at 3 step left, that would block moving left.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged such that moving left from my position is possible, but moving further left is blocked by the wall at 3 step left.

This is too ambiguous. Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe I should just choose a direction to move, like right or down, and see if that progresses.

Wait, the last action was ""right,"" which might have moved me closer to the wall. Maybe I need to go down instead.

Another approach: since I can't reach the ""win"" directly, change the rule so that touching the door makes me win. For that, I need ""door is you"" or ""door is win.""

To make ""door is you,"" I need to move the ""is"" block next to the door and the word ""you."" The ""you"" is at 1 right,5 down. The door is at 6 right,2 down. The ""is"" block is at 6 right,1 up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block down to the door's level.

From the ""is"" at 6 right,1 up, moving down three steps to reach the door at 2 down. But the path is blocked by the ""stop"" at 1 right and 2 down. So I can't move down past that stop.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block left to adjacent the door. But the door is at 6 right,2 down. The ""is"" is at 6 right,1 up. Moving left from there would require avoiding walls.

This is really tough. Maybe I need to try moving the ""is"" block towards the door. If I can push it left and down, but there's a stop in the way.

Alternatively, use the ball to push the ""is"" block. If I can push the","

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So I can't go directly right from my current position because that's a wall. The ball is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up, but I don't know if that's relevant yet. There's a ""win"" block up there, but blocked by the wall. 

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change something. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule to somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I could turn into the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block.

But I need to check if I can move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't marked as stop, wall, or anything else, so I can move it. My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm starting near the ""baba"" rule that's 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. So my position is probably at that location.

To move the ""is"" rule at 2 steps left and 1 step up, I need to navigate there. Let's think about the steps. From my position (3 left, 5 down), to get to the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 1 up, I need to move left once and up five times. But there might be walls in the way. Looking at the map, there's a wall at 3 steps to the left (which is my current position's left neighbor?), and other walls. Wait, the walls are at 2 steps to the right and 1 up, and other positions. Maybe moving left is possible if there's no wall blocking.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. If I can't reach the ""win"" block directly, maybe I can push a wall out of the way. But the walls are either ""wall"" rules or actual walls. The ""wall"" rule at 3 steps left might be a text block that I can move if it's not stopped. Wait, the rule ""wall"" is at 3 steps left, but the actual walls are at different positions. So perhaps moving the ""wall"" rule would change the game's rules.

Alternatively, maybe I should create a new rule like ""wall is stop"" to make existing walls immovable, but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition, so I could just stand on the ""win"" block. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

So the plan is: move the ""is"" rule from 2 left, 1 up to be next to ""baba"" (which is at 3 left, 5 down) and ""win"" (7 right, 1 up). But how? Maybe first move the ""is"" rule to a position where I can combine it with ""baba"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, since the ""win"" is at 7 right and 1 up, and there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up, perhaps I can move the wall out of the way by moving its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, so if I can move that rule to elsewhere, maybe the wall at 2 right and 1 up would disappear. But that's a long shot.

Another angle: the ""door"" is at 6 right and 2 down. Maybe if I can push the door, but doors are usually passable unless stopped. Not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. So anything stopped can't be moved. But I'm Baba, defined as you, so I can move unless stopped. Since I'm not stopped, I can push objects that aren't stopped.

Looking back, the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 1 up is movable. If I can move that ""is"" to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then I can create ""baba is win."" Let's see. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 5 down. The ""win"" is at 7 right, 1 up. So moving the ""is"" rule from 2 left,1 up to, say, 3 left, 5 down (next to ""baba"") would allow creating ""baba is win."" Then I'd be the win condition.

To do that, I need to navigate from my position (3 left,5 down) to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up. The movement would be left once and up five steps. But there might be obstacles. Let's check the path:

From 3 left,5 down to 2 left,1 up: left once (to 2 left,5 down), then up five times to 2 left,1 up. The path up would go through:

2 left,5 down → 2 left,4 down (is there a wall? At 2 right,4 down, there's a wall. But I'm at 2 left,4 down, which is clear. Then up to 2 left,3 down: wall at 2 steps right and 3 down? No, the wall at 2 right and 3 down is on the opposite side. So maybe clear. Then 2 left,2 down: rule `stop` is at 1 right and 2 down. So from 2 left,2 down, moving up would be to 2 left,1 up, which is the ""is"" rule. But between 2 left,2 down and 2 left,1 up, is there a wall? The wall at 2 right,2 down is two steps to the right, so not in the path. So the path seems clear. So I can move left once, then up five times to get to the ""is"" rule.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" For example, move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to ""baba"" (3 left,5 down), making ""baba is [something]"". Then set it to ""win"" by placing it next to the ""win"" block.

Alternatively, after grabbing the ""is"" rule, move it to the ""win"" block's position and combine it with ""baba.""

So step-by-step:

1. Move left once from current position (3 left,5 down) to 2 left,5 down.
2. Move up five times to reach 2 left,1 up, grabbing the ""is"" rule.
3. Now, move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to ""baba"" (3 left,5 down). So move right once to 3 left,1 up, then down four times to 3 left,5 down. Place the ""is"" there.
4. Now the rule would be ""baba is [something]"". To make it ""baba is win"", need to place ""win"" next to it. The ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" rule next to the existing ""you"" rule at 1 left,5 down. Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 left,5 down. If I can move ""is"" to be next to ""baba"" and ""you"", but not sure.

Alternatively, after having the ""is"" rule, move it to the ""win"" block's location (7 right,1 up). That would require moving right five times and up zero. But there's a wall at 2 right,1 up. So can't go directly right. Maybe push the wall by moving its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. If I can move that rule away, the wall at 2 right,1 up might disappear.

So another plan:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to 2 left,1 up.
2. Use it to create ""win is stop"" or something, but not helpful.
3. Alternatively, move the ""wall"" rule at 3 left to elsewhere. For example, move it to 7 right,1 up, but that's tricky.

Alternatively, since the ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up, and there's a wall there, maybe pushing the wall by moving its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. If I can move that rule to 7 right,1 up, then the wall at 2 right,1 up would be replaced by the new ""wall"" rule at 7 right,1 up, but that doesn't help. Hmm.

Maybe the key is to create ""baba is win"" by placing the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win"". Since ""baba"" is at 3 left,5 down and ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up, the ""is"" rule needs to be in between. But that's a long distance. Alternatively, create ""win is you"" so that reaching the win block makes me win, but I'm already ""you"".

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you"". If I can make ""win is you"", then stepping on win would work. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""you"". The ""you"" is at 1 left,5 down. So placing ""is"" between ""win"" (7 right,1 up) and ""you"" (1 left,5 down) isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"". Since ""baba"" is at 3 left,5 down and ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up, the ""is"" rule would need to be placed in a position that connects both. Maybe place ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then push it towards ""win"" by moving it right and up.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the immediate actions. The closest ""is"" rule is at 2 left,1 up. If I can grab that and move it to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"", that would do the trick.

So the steps would be:

- Move from current position (assuming at ""rule `baba`"" at 3 left,5 down) to the ""is"" at 2 left,1 up.
- Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to a position adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"".

The problem is the distance. Moving the ""is"" rule from 2 left,1 up to 3 left,5 down (next to ""baba"") requires moving right once and down four times. Then, from there, move the ""is"" rule towards ""win"" at 7 right,1 up. But that's a long move, and there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, after placing ""baba is win"" near ""baba"", then I would be the win condition, so standing on any ""win"" block would suffice. But the ""win"" block is behind a wall. So even if I become the win condition, I need to reach the block.

Alternatively, push the wall by moving its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 3 left. If I can move that rule, say, to the position of the wall at 2 right,1 up, then the wall would move, allowing passage.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to 2 left,1 up to 3 left,5 down (next to ""baba""), creating ""baba is win"".
2. Now, as win, I just need to reach the win block. But it's blocked by a wall. So I need to remove the wall. To do that, find the ""wall"" rule (at 3 left) and move it away.

So steps:

a. From ""baba"" at 3 left,5 down, move left to 2 left,5 down, then up to 2 left,1 up to grab the ""is"" rule.
b. Move the ""is"" rule right to 3 left,1 up, then down four times to 3 left,5 down, placing it next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"".
c. Now, go to the ""wall"" rule at 3 left. Move left from 3 left,5 down to 2 left,5 down, then up to 2 left,1 up (but ""is"" is there now). Wait, no, ""is"" is at 3 left,5 down. So from 3 left,5 down, move left to 2 left,5 down, then up five times to 2 left,1 up (grab ""is"" again?), but maybe need to go to the ""wall"" rule at 3 left. Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 3 step to the left, which is 3 left from where? The initial position is unclear, but assuming the map's coordinates are relative.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since I'm Baba and can move, and the win is blocked by a wall, perhaps I can push the wall by moving it. The wall at 2 right,1 up is a physical wall, but its rule is ""wall"" at 3 left. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, the wall might disappear.

So, to move the ""wall"" rule from 3 left to, say, 7 right,3 down (anywhere not blocking the path), then the wall at 2 right,1 up would no longer exist. Then I could move right past it to the win block.

To do that:

1. Find the ""wall"" rule at 3 left.
2. Move it to a new position.

But how to get to the ""wall"" rule at 3 left from my current position (assuming at 3 left,5 down):

- Move left from 3 left,5 down to 2 left,5 down.
- Move up five times to 2 left,1 up (grab ""is"" rule).
- Then move left again to 1 left,1 up, then down four times to 1 left,5 down (where ""you"" is).
- Not helpful. Alternatively, after getting the ""is"" rule, move it to modify the ""wall"" rule.

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" rule by first getting to its location. From 3 left,5 down, move left to 4 left,5 down (if possible), but there's a wall at 2 step to the left (rule `wall` 3 step to the left). Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 3 step to the left from where? Maybe the initial position is the center, and steps are relative.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let's try to outline the possible actions based on the last observation.

Current active rules: baba is you.

Objects present:

- rule `is` at 2 step to the left and 1 step up.
- ball at 1 step left and 1 up.
- wall at 2 right and 1 up.
- rule `is` at 6 right and 1 up.
- win at 7 right and 1 up.
- wall at 3 left.
- walls at 2 right, various downs.
- door at 6 right, 2 down.
- ball at 6 right, 3 down.
- etc.

The immediate goal is to reach the win block at 7 right,1 up, but blocked by a wall at 2 right,1 up.

Possible actions:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 2 left,1 up to create a new rule that allows passing the wall or becoming the win condition.

For example, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

To do that:

- Navigate to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up.
- Pick it up and move it to a position adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"".

But the distance is great. Alternatively, create ""win is you"" so that stepping on win works, but I'm already you.

Alternatively, create ""wall is stop"" to make the existing walls immovable (but they already are).

Another idea: Use the ball. If I can push the ball into the door, but the door is a win condition when stepped on. Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right,2 down. If I can remove it, then maybe other objects can be moved.

But how? To do that, I need to create a rule that changes ""stop"" to something else, or eliminate the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, make ""stop is nothing"" by creating a new rule, but that requires text blocks.

This is quite challenging. Given the time constraints, the best immediate action might be to move towards the ""is"" rule to grab it and then create the necessary rule.

So, the chosen action is to move left to reach the ""is"" rule. From the current position (assuming at 3 left,5 down), moving left once gets to 2 left,5 down. Then up five times to reach 2 left,1 up, where the ""is"" rule is located. Once there, the action would be to pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to the desired position.

But the system requires a single action per step. So the first step is to move left to get closer to the ""is"" rule.

Therefore, the action should be ""left"".

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Walls are blocking some paths. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, and there's another ""is"" rule next to it along with ""you"" at 5 steps down.

Hmm, the player (Baba) is probably at the same position as the ""baba"" rule or nearby. To get to the ""win"" object, moving right towards the top might be the way, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to change something. But the ""is"" rule is a text block, so I need to move it. But can I? The rules say I can move objects unless they're stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which isn't adjacent to the ""is"" rule here. So maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 steps right, 1 step up to somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""ball"" to make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it a win. But the ball is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. To get there, I might need to navigate past walls. But right now, the path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the layout again.

The map has walls at 4 steps right, 1 step up, and others further down. The ""door"" is at 8 steps right, 2 steps down. Maybe moving the ""win"" rule to be under the door? Or changing ""door is win""? Wait, the ""door"" is a separate object. If I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would be the win condition. But how?

The key is to move the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, then I could create ""door is win."" But moving the ""is"" rule down two steps would require stepping on it, but I need to be able to move it. Since there's a wall at 4 steps right, maybe moving left first?

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""is"" rule that's at 1 step left and 1 step up. That ""is"" is near the ball and maybe can be moved to attach to the ""ball"" to make ""ball is win."" But the ball is at 1 step up, which is where the ""is"" is currently. If I move that ""is"" down to where the ball is, then ""ball is win"" would be created. Then, moving to the ball would make it a win. But the ball is under a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the ball is at 1 step up, but the wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe the ball is in a different column?

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize the grid. Assuming Baba is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. To move towards the ""win"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Maybe go left first to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" down to the ball's position (1 step up), then combine them to make ""ball is win."" Then, moving to the ball would make it a win.

So steps could be: move left to the ""is"" rule, then down to the ball's location, place the ""is"" there, making ""ball is win."" Then move right to the ball and win. But how to move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move text blocks unless they're stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, so I can pick it up. So first, move left to the ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. Then move down to the ball's position (1 step up). Wait, the ""is"" is already at 1 step left and 1 step up. The ball is at 1 step up, so same row. Maybe the ""is"" is to the left of the ball. So moving the ""is"" right to be next to the ball. Then, place it there to create ""ball is win.""

Once that's done, moving to the ball (which is now a win) would complete the level. But how to execute the moves step by step. The current action required is the next move. So from the current position (probably at the ""baba"" rule's location, 2 left, 5 down), the immediate actions could be to move left towards the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. So first action: left. Then, move up to reach the ""is"" rule. But in the observation, after moving left, the previous actions led to defaults because the reasoning wasn't clear. Maybe the assistant needs to directly output the next action based on the current position.

Alternatively, maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the ""win"" location, but blocked by walls. Alternatively, look for a path using the door. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make the door a win, then go through it. To do that, move the ""is"" rule next to the door. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 1 up. Need to move it down two steps to 8 right, 3 down, but there's a wall at 3 right, 3 down. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up can be moved down. Let's see, moving down from there would place it at 8 right, 2 down, which is where the door is. If I move that ""is"" down to 8 right, 2 down, then place it next to the door, creating ""door is win."" Then, stepping on the door would win. So the steps would be: move to the ""is"" at 8 right, 1 up (which might require moving right multiple times), then move down twice to reach the door's position, place the ""is"" there. But how to get there from the current position.

Current position of Baba is at 2 left, 5 down. To reach 8 right, 1 up, need to move right 10 times and up 6 times. That's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, focus on the ""is"" at 1 left, 1 up. Let's say I'm at 2 left, 5 down. To get to 1 left, 1 up: move left once (to 1 left, 5 down), then up four times to reach 1 left, 1 up. Then pick up the ""is"" there and move it right to the ball's position (1 step up), which is probably in the same column. Then place it there to make ""ball is win.""

So the next action would be to move left. But previous attempts to output ""left"" led to defaults because the system didn't recognize it. Wait, no, the user's previous attempts with ""left"" were valid actions. Maybe the issue was in the reasoning process, but the final action had to be one of the allowed directions.

Given that, the best immediate action is to move left towards the ""is"" rule located 1 step left and 1 step up. So the action should be ""left"".

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and possibly manipulate other objects by moving the rule ""is"" or other text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's probably the target. But there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at positions 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and others further down. There's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down, which makes whatever it's attached to immovable. 

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it a win condition. Or maybe ""baba is win"" so that touching Baba himself becomes the win condition. 

Let me check the positions again. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move it to the left next to the ""ball"" that's 1 step right and 1 step up, maybe I can combine them. If I move the ""is"" to the left, attaching it to the ball, then it would create ""ball is win,"" changing the win condition to the ball. Then, I could push the ball to the ""win"" rule's position. But how do I move the ""is"" in the first place?

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move freely, but I have to avoid ""STOP"" or objects with immovable properties. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So I need to navigate around that. 

Looking at the map layout:

- The starting position has the ""is"" rule 1 step up. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from there. The walls are to the right of the ball. The ""win"" is far to the right. There's a door at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, which might be a way through if I can make it passable.

Wait, there's a ""door"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door something else, like ""door is nothing"" or ""door is you,"" maybe I can pass through it. But first, I need to manipulate the rules.

The key is probably to reassign the ""is"" rule to combine with other objects. Let me think: if I move the ""is"" from 1 step up to the left next to the ""wall"" that's 1 step left, then create ""wall is stop"" or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" to the ball to make ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition. Then I need to push the ball to the original ""win"" position.

But how to move the ""is""? If I'm at the initial position, maybe I can move left to the ""is"" rule, take it, and move it to the ball. Let's check the positions again:

- The ""is"" is 1 step up from the starting position. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the starting position. So if I move up to grab the ""is"" rule, then move right to the ball, place the ""is"" next to the ball, making ""ball is win."" Then, I can move the ball to the ""win"" position at 9 steps right and 1 step up.

But moving right from the ""is"" position to the ball would require passing through the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, no—the walls are at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is further to the right than the ball's position (which is 1 step right and 1 step up). So maybe there's a path. Let me visualize:

Starting position (assuming I'm at the original Baba position). The ""is"" is 1 step up. Moving up there, then taking the ""is"" rule. Then moving right to the ball's position (1 step right from the ""is"" rule). Then placing the ""is"" to the left of the ball, making ""ball is win."" Then, pushing the ball right past the walls to the ""win"" rule.

But can I push the ball? Since ""baba is you,"" and the ball's default property isn't specified, I think I can push it unless there's a ""stop"" in the way. The walls are at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. So moving the ball right would require moving past the wall at 4 steps right, which is far away. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, if I make the door passable. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can change the door's rule, maybe to ""door is you,"" then I could go through it. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the door. Let's see: from the current position, after moving the ""is"" to the ball to make it a win, maybe I can then move to the door area. But there are walls and a stop block in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a ""win"" rule elsewhere. The original ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make a new ""win"" rule close to me, then reaching that would win. But how?

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can turn myself into a win. If I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Let's see the movement required.

From the initial position, moving down to reach the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down. But there's a ""stop"" at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So navigating around that would be tricky. Maybe moving down, then left or right avoiding the stop.

Alternatively, focus on the ball. If I make the ball the win, then push it to the original win position. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" rule (1 step up).
2. Move right to the ball's position (1 step right from ""is"").
3. Place the ""is"" to the left of the ball, creating ""ball is win.""
4. Now, move to the ball and push it right towards the original ""win"" position.

But the path to push the ball is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up. However, the ball's new win condition means that reaching it would win, but the original win is still there. Wait, the problem says the goal is usually to reach the object defined as ""WIN,"" but if you change the rules, you can change the win condition. So if I make the ball a win, then touching the ball anywhere would win. So maybe I don't need to push it to the original position; just reach the ball.

But how to reach the ball? The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule. After placing ""ball is win,"" I could move down to the ball's position and touch it, winning the level. That might be easier.

So the steps would be:

- Move up to the ""is"" rule.
- Take the ""is"" rule.
- Move right to the ball.
- Place the ""is"" to the left of the ball, making ""ball is win.""
- Move down to the ball and touch it, winning.

But wait, when I place the ""is"" next to the ball, the new rule would be ""ball is win,"" replacing any existing rule for ball? Or is it appended? In Baba Is You, placing a rule next to an object combines them. So if the ball already has a rule (like from the original setup?), but looking at the observation, the ball's position is listed as ""ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up,"" without any attached rule. So placing ""is"" to the left would create ""ball is win.""

Yes, that makes sense. So by doing that, the ball becomes the win condition. Then, I can walk to the ball and win.

So the actions needed are:

1. Move up once to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Grab the ""is"" rule (by moving onto it? Or is taking it a different action? In the game, you move onto a text block to interact with it. So maybe move up, then move to the ""is"" rule's position, then move again to take it? Not sure. Maybe in this context, the action is to move to the position of the ""is"" rule and pick it up.)

Assuming that moving to the ""is"" rule's position and then taking it requires moving up, then maybe the sequence is:

- Action: up (to get to the ""is"" rule)
- Then, move right to the ball's position (but the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the starting position. Wait, the ""is"" is 1 step up from the starting position. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the starting position. So from the ""is"" rule's position (1 step up), moving right would take me to the ball's position.

So:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right to the ball.
3. Place the ""is"" to the left of the ball (which is the current position after moving right). So placing the ""is"" left would create ""ball is win.""
4. Then move down to the ball's position and touch it.

But how to place the ""is"" rule? In the game, you have to move the text block next to the subject. So if I'm on the ball, moving left to place the ""is"" there. So after moving right to the ball, move left to place the ""is"" next to the ball, making ""ball is win.""

Then, the next action would be to move down to the ball's position (which is now a win) and stand on it to win.

So the sequence of actions would be:

up (to get to the ""is"" rule)
right (to the ball)
left (to place ""is"" next to ball, making ""ball is win"")
down (to the ball)
idle (or any action, since touching it would win)

But the problem is that the user is asking for a single action based on the current observation. The current observation is the initial state where ""baba is you"" and the objects are as listed. The assistant needs to choose one action to take now.

In the current observation, the assistant's previous actions were ""left"", ""right"", etc., but they kept failing. Now, the user is prompting for a valid action. So the correct action now is to move towards the ""is"" rule to start manipulating.

Looking at the current observation's objects:

- The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from the starting position (assuming the starting position is where Baba is, which isn't explicitly stated but inferred from the rules).
- The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the starting position.

So, from Baba's current position, to get to the ""is"" rule, the action would be ""up"". Then, move right to the ball, then left to place the ""is"".

But since the system is asking for a single action based on the current observation, the immediate action needed is to move up to reach the ""is"" rule. Once that's done, the next actions would follow, but the user is only asking for the next step.

Therefore, the correct action now is to move up to grab the ""is"" rule.

I need to figure out how to progress in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current active rules and the objects on the map.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, Baba becomes that object. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I should check if any rules have changed that. Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule located at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. So originally, the win condition is that position. But I need to see if there are any other rules that might alter this.

First, I need to move. Where can I go? The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position. Let me check the map layout. There's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. Maybe I can move up to that rule? But wait, can I move the ""is"" rule? The rules say that objects with ""STOP"" or similar can't be moved, but ""is"" might be movable unless there's a rule saying it's stop. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule `stop`"" at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. That's probably immovable. So ""is"" rules might be movable unless they're part of a ""stop"" rule.

So, to manipulate the rules, I need to move the ""is"" block to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" up next to the ""win"" rule, then I could make a new rule like ""win is you,"" making Baba win by touching win. But right now, the ""win"" is a rule, not an object. Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. To make ""win"" a win condition, perhaps I need to change the existing rule. But the current rule is ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right..."" Hmm, maybe I need to take the ""win"" rule and move it somewhere else?

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push a block next to Baba to create a new rule. For instance, if I move the ""is"" block that's 1 step up to be next to ""baba,"" creating ""baba is [something]."" But right now, the ""is"" block is 1 step up. If I move up, I can get to that ""is"" block. Let me see: the player is likely at the position where the ""rule `baba`"" is, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down. So current position is 1 left, 5 down. To get to the ""is"" block that's 1 step up, I need to move up from my current position. But wait, moving up from 5 down would take me to 5-1=4 down, but the ""is"" block is 1 step up from where? Maybe the positions are relative. Let me parse the object positions again.

The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up from where? The description says ""Objects on the map"" with their positions relative to the player? Or are these absolute positions? This is a bit confusing. Maybe the positions are relative to the player's current location. For example, if the player is at (0,0), then ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is at (0,1). Similarly, ""ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" would be at (1,1). The walls are at various positions relative to the player.

Assuming that, the player's position is the origin. So the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is above the player. The ""ball"" is to the right and up. The ""win"" is far to the right and up. The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps right and 2 down, which is a wall that can't be moved through.

The goal is to reach the ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. But how? Since Baba is you, moving towards the win would be possible unless there's a wall in the way. Let's check the path. From the player's current position, moving right 4 steps to reach the first wall at 4 right, 1 up. Then there's another wall at 4 right. Then a ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 2 down. So the direct path to the win is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move some blocks to create a path.

Alternatively, change the rules. For example, create a ""baba is win"" rule, which would make touching the win object make Baba win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". Let's see. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""is"" block is at 1 up. So if I can move the ""is"" block from 1 up to be next to the ""win"" rule, then combine them. But how?

The player is at (0,0) probably. The ""is"" block is at (0,1). To get to the ""win"" rule at (9,1), I need to move right 9 steps, but there are walls at 4 right. So that's blocked. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the win's position. But the ""is"" block is separate. Maybe I can push the ""is"" block by moving right or left. Wait, can I push blocks? In Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not defined as STOP. The ""is"" rule might be pushable unless there's a STOP rule. Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 2 down. So objects on that spot can't be moved. But the ""is"" blocks at 1 up and 8 right, 1 up are probably movable.

So, if I move right from the player's position, I can get to the first wall at 4 right, 1 up. But before that, at 1 right, 1 up is a ball. Maybe I can move the ball out of the way? But to move the ball, I need to be next to it and push it. The ball is at 1 right, 1 up. If I move right from the player's position (0,0) to (1,0), then up to (1,1), that's the ball's position. Then, if I push the ball, it would move to (2,1). But can I push the ball? The ball's rule is determined by other rules. If there's a ""ball is stop"" or something, then no. But looking at the active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you."" So the ball is an object, but its properties aren't defined, so it's movable unless there's a STOP rule. Since there's a STOP rule at 3 right, 2 down, but that's a different position. So the ball can be moved.

So, moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1) to push the ball. Then, the ball would move to (2,1). This might create a path. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block from 1 up to another position. For example, move up to (0,1) to get the ""is"" block, then move right with it. Let's see:

1. Move up to (0,1) to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Then move right, possibly pushing other objects out of the way. For example, the ball is at (1,1). If I'm at (0,1) with the ""is"" block, moving right to (1,1) (the ball's position), I can push the ball to (2,1). Then, move the ""is"" block to (2,1) next to the ball. But the ball is now at (2,1). Then, create a rule like ""ball is you"" by placing ""is"" next to ""ball"". But the ""you"" rule is already at 1 right, 5 down. So if I make ""ball is you,"" then touching the ball would make me you, but I'm already you. Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, create a ""baba is win"" rule. To do that, I need to have ""baba"" next to ""win"" and ""is"". The ""win"" rule is at (9,1). The ""is"" block is at (0,1). So moving the ""is"" block all the way to (9,1) next to ""win"" would create ""win is you"" if we place ""is"" next to ""win"". Wait, no. The syntax is ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So to make ""win IS YOU"", we need to have ""win"" next to ""is"" and ""you"". But currently, ""you"" is at (1,5). That's far away.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"". But the ""win"" is far to the right. Maybe there's another way. Let's think differently. The ""you"" rule is already active because ""baba is you"". So maybe I can just move towards the ""win"" object. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 4 right, 1 up, and others down. So maybe I need to rearrange the blocks to remove the walls.

For example, the ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 up is a block that cannot be passed unless it's changed. Since ""wall is stop"" or similar. But looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"". That means ""wall IS [something]"". Wait, the objects include ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"". So that's a rule that says ""wall is [something]"". But the active rule is only ""baba is you"". So the properties of wall are not defined, so it's movable unless there's a STOP rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down, which is a separate object.

So, the walls at 4 right, 1 up are movable. If I can move them out of the way, I can path to the win. To move the wall at 4 right, 1 up, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Let's see. The player is at (0,0). To get to the wall at (4,1), I need to move right 4 steps and up 1. But along the way, there's a ball at (1,1). So maybe push the ball out of the way first.

So step-by-step:

1. Move right from (0,0) to (1,0).
2. Move up to (1,1) (the ball's position).
3. Push the ball to the right by moving right again to (2,1), pushing the ball to (2,1).
4. Now, from (2,1), move right to (3,1), then to (4,1) (the wall's position).
5. Push the wall to the right to (5,1), creating a path.

But can I push the wall? Since the wall's rule is ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"", which probably means ""wall is [something]"", but without an active property, it's movable unless stopped. So yes, I can push it.

Once the wall is moved, I can go right past it to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up. Then, pick up that ""is"" rule and move it to the ""win"" position to create a new rule.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the door a win condition. There's a ""door"" rule at 7 right, 2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then going through the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"".

But this seems complicated. Another approach: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can become the win by creating a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule at 9 right, 1 up. If I can make ""you"" into ""win"", but ""you"" is already active as ""baba is you"". Hmm.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". All other rules are objects that can be moved. So maybe the key is to create a new rule like ""win is you"", which would make touching the win object make you win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you"".

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. That's a distance apart. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule closer to the ""win"" and then place ""is"" between them.

But how to do that? Let's think step by step.

Current position: Assuming the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left, 5 down. So ( -1, 5 ).

First, move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up (0,1).

Then, move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location (9,1). But that's a long way. There are walls in the way. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""you"" rule at (1,5).

So, from (0,1), move down to (0,0), then right to (1,0), up to (1,1) (ball), push the ball right to (2,1), then continue moving right and up to reach (1,5) where the ""you"" rule is.

Once there, place the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win"". But ""win"" is far away. Alternatively, create ""you is win"", making ""you"" equivalent to ""win"". Since ""baba is you"", that would make ""baba is win"", so touching the win object would make you win.

To create ""you is win"", you need to have ""you"" next to ""is"" and ""win"". So, if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win"", but they are in different locations.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach: use the existing ""door"" at 7 right, 2 down. If I can make the door a win by creating ""door is win"", then going through the door would work. To do that, move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""win"".

The door is at (7,2), win is at (9,1). Not adjacent. Maybe move the ""is"" block to (8,2), between door and win? Not sure.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location. Let's try:

1. Move up from the player's position ( -1,5 ) to ( -1,4 ), ( -1,3 ), etc., until reaching (0,1) where the ""is"" block is.
2. Grab the ""is"" block and move right towards the ""win"" at (9,1). But there's a wall at (4,1). To get past that, need to move the wall.
3. As before, push the wall at (4,1) to the right by moving right past it.
4. Once the path is clear, move the ""is"" block to (9,1) next to ""win"", creating ""win is you"".
5. Now, since ""baba is you"", touching the ""win"" object would make you win.

So the steps would be:

- Move up to get the ""is"" block.
- Push the ball and wall to clear the path.
- Move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location.
- Create ""win is you"" rule.
- Move to the ""win"" object and win.

But how to execute this in the game?

First, navigate to the ""is"" block at (0,1):

From player's position ( -1,5 ):

Move up once to ( -1,4 ).

Then up again to ( -1,3 ).

Then up again to ( -1,2 ).

Then up again to ( -1,1 ).

Then up to ( -1,0 ).

Then up to ( -1, -1 ). Wait, maybe the directions are relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe the coordinates are based on the player's position. Let's assume that the player starts at (0,0), and all other positions are relative.

So, ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is at (0,1).

""ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" is at (1,1).

""wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is at (4,1).

The player's initial position is where the ""baba"" rule is, which is ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"". So that's at (-1, -5) if the player is at (0,0).

Wait, this is getting too complicated with coordinates. Maybe think in terms of directions relative to the player.

The player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule: 1 step left and 5 steps down from where? Maybe the player's starting position is considered (0,0), and all other objects are relative to that.

So, ""baba"" is at (-1, -5).

The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from the player's position: (0,1).

The ""ball"" is 1 step right and 1 up: (1,1).

The ""wall"" at 4 right, 1 up: (4,1).

The ""win"" is 9 right, 1 up: (9,1).

The ""stop"" rule is 3 right, 2 down: (3,-2).

The ""door"" is 8 right, 2 down: (8,-2).

The ""ball"" rule is 8 right, 3 down: (8,-3).

The ""baba"" rule is 1 left, 5 down: (-1,-5).

The ""is"" rule at 5 down: (0,-5).

The ""you"" rule is 1 right, 5 down: (1,-5).

So the player starts at (-1,-5).

To get to the ""is"" rule at (0,1), the player needs to move up 6 steps (from -5 to 1 in the y-direction) and right 1 step","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The game is Baba Is You, and the goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which in the initial rules is a ""win"". But sometimes you can change the rules. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move around as Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to change a rule. The ball is 1 step right and up. Wall is 4 steps right and up. Then another rule `is` at 8 steps right and up, and ""win"" at 9 steps right. There's a ""wall"" 1 step left, and several walls in a grid to the right. A ""stop"" block at 3 right, 2 down. A door at 8 right, 2 down. Ball again at 8 right, 3 down. And then a rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down, with ""is"" and ""you"" rules there.

Since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can push objects that aren't stopped. The main goal here is probably to get to the ""win"" which is at 9 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop block. The door at 8 right, 2 down might be a way through if I can open it. But how?

Wait, the door is a rule `door`, but normally doors are interactable. Maybe I need to change the door's rule to something else. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball somewhere. The ball is at 8 right, 3 down. If I can push it onto the door, maybe that does something? Or perhaps the ball is part of a rule.

Looking at the rules: there's a ""rule `ball`"" at 8 right, 3 down. So the ball is a rule block that says ""ball is..."", but what exactly? The current rules don't show what the ball is defined as. Maybe it's defined elsewhere. Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules are on the map as objects that can be moved.

So maybe I need to move the existing ""rule `is`"" blocks to create new rules. The rule `is` at 1 step up: if I move it next to ""ball"", I could make ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win"", changing the game. But to do that, I need to navigate to that rule block.

My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm starting at Baba's position, which is at ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"". So I'm at (1 left, 5 down). The ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 5 down, so I need to get there maybe? Or perhaps I can move the ""is"" rule upwards to combine with other objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball towards the door. If I can get the ball onto the door, maybe it opens? But I need to get past the stop block at 3 right, 2 down. The stop block makes whatever it's on or adjacent to immovable. So to get past it, I might need to rearrange rules to make it not a stop.

Alternatively, the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. That's far to the right. The path there is blocked by walls and the stop block. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `stop`"" block at 3 right, 2 down. Since I'm Baba, and assuming I can push objects that aren't stopped, I might be able to move that rule block if it's not stopped itself. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 2 down. The wall at 4 right, 2 down is behind it. So maybe I can push the ""stop"" rule to the left or right to remove it from blocking the path.

But to do that, I need to approach the ""stop"" rule. From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving up to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. If I go up once, I'm at the same level as the ""is"" rule. Then I could move right to get to the ball and other rules. Alternatively, maybe I need to first get to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right, 5 down. If I move right from my position, that's possible. But the path might be blocked.

Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. So moving right from my position (1 left, 5 down) would require moving towards the right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, 5 down. So I can't go straight right from there. Maybe I need to go up first.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I move up once, then I can interact with that rule. Then move right to the ball. If I can create a new rule like ""ball is win"", then the ball would become the win condition. Then I could push the ball to my position, making me win.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move from current position (1 left, 5 down) to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. To do that, move up once.

2. Once at the ""is"" rule, move right to reach the ball at 1 step right and 1 step up. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to the ball to create ""ball is [something]"".

3. If I make ""ball is win"", then the ball becomes the win object. Then I can push the ball to my position, achieving the win.

But how to move the ""is"" rule? Let's see. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. My current position is 1 left, 5 down. Moving up once gets me to 1 left, 4 down? Wait, directions might be confusing. The observation says the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up from where? Maybe the coordinate system is relative. Assuming that the player's position is not given, but the objects are positioned relative to something.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So the player's starting position is at (left 1, down 5). The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from there, so (left 1, up 1). The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule, so (left 1 + right 1, up 1) = (neutral, up 1). The wall is 4 steps right and 1 up from the ""is"" rule, so (right 4, up 1).

So the player's starting position is (left 1, down 5). To get to the ""is"" rule at (left 1, up 1), the player needs to move up 5 steps. But that might be possible. However, the path might be blocked. Let's see: moving up from (left 1, down 5) to (left 1, down 4), then down 3, etc., up to (left 1, up 1). Along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But that's far to the right. The walls in between are at 1 step left (rule wall?), and others further right. So moving up from the player's position, the path should be clear except for maybe the stop block at 3 steps right, 2 steps down. But that's further down and to the right.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move right from their starting position to reach the ""is"" rule. But their starting position is left 1, 5 down. To move right, they'd go to neutral, 5 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 1 step left is probably the same as the player's position? Not sure.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. So from the player's position (left 1, down 5), moving up once would be to (left 1, down 4). Then up again to (left 1, down 3), and so on until reaching (left 1, up 1). Along the way, check if there are any walls blocking the path. The only walls mentioned are at 4 steps right, 1 step up, and others further right. So moving up vertically should be possible.

Once at the ""is"" rule, move right to get to the ball. The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule, which would place it at (neutral, up 1). Then, move the ""is"" rule to the right next to the ball, so that combining them creates a new rule like ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win"". Since the goal is to reach the win, making the ball the win condition would be better. So moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball and then combining them to make ""ball is win"".

Once that rule is created, the ball would become the win object. Then, the player can push the ball towards their position, making them win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move up from the player's starting position to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

2. Move right to the ball's position.

3. Move the ""is"" rule next to the ball.

4. Combine them to create ""ball is win"".

5. Push the ball to the player's position to win.

But how to execute these moves? Each move is a single step. Let's break it down.

Starting position: Assume (0,0) is the player's initial position, but the actual coordinates are based on the observations. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, so perhaps the coordinate system is relative. This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe it's better to think in terms of relative movements.

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from there, so moving up once. Then, the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule. So from the player's starting position, moving up once gets to the ""is"" rule. Then moving right once gets to the ball.

Once there, the player can push the ""is"" rule to the right to place it next to the ball. Then, the two blocks combined would form ""ball is [property]"". Since the ""is"" rule is being moved, the player can create a new rule.

After creating ""ball is win"", the ball becomes the win object. Then, the player can move towards the ball and push it onto themselves, thus winning.

So the actions needed are:

- Move up (to get to the ""is"" rule).

- Move right (to get to the ball).

- Move right again to push the ""is"" rule next to the ball.

- Then, the new rule ""ball is win"" is active.

- Finally, move towards the ball and push it to the player's position.

But in the current observation, after moving the ""is"" rule next to the ball, the player would have to navigate to the ball's new position and push it. However, in the given observation, the ball is already at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down in another part of the map. Wait, no, in the initial observation, the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. But later observations show the ball moving as the rules change. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to use the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If the door can be made passable by changing its rule. For example, if ""door is push"", then the player can push it open. But to do that, the player needs to create that rule.

But the player currently has ""baba is you"", so they can move. The main obstacles are walls and the stop block. The stop block at 3 steps right and 2 steps down is part of the problem. If the player can move that rule to another position, the stop effect would be removed.

So another approach:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 2 down.

2. Push it left or right to remove it from blocking the path.

But to get to the ""stop"" rule, the player needs to navigate through the map. From the starting position, moving right towards the ""stop"" rule would require passing through walls. The walls are at 4 steps right in various positions, so the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" rule and create a new rule that removes the stop property. For example, ""stop is nothing"" or ""stop is rule"". But I'm not sure how that would work.

This is quite tricky. Let me try to outline the possible valid actions based on the current observation.

The active rule is ""baba is you"", so the player can move. The objects nearby include the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, the ball at 1 step right and up, walls, etc.

Possible actions:

- Move up to reach the ""is"" rule.

- Move right towards the ball.

- Push the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

Given that the previous attempts resulted in failures, maybe the correct action here is to move up first to get to the ""is"" rule, which is the key to creating new rules.

So the chosen action would be ""up"".

Let's see. The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with other objects. My goal seems to be reaching the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right and up. But there are walls and a stop rule blocking the way.

First, I need to look at the objects on the map. There's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. The ""win"" is protected by a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 down. To open the door, I might need a key or change the rule. There's a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 3 down. Maybe I can use the ball somehow.

Looking at the rules, there's ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and up. If I can move that to combine with ""ball"" or ""win,"" I could change what's win. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win. But how to move the rule blocks? The walls are 4 steps right and up, so I might be next to them. The ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 down means I can't push past that.

I'm currently at the position of ""rule `baba`"" 1 step left and 5 steps down. Wait, no—the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I must be the Baba object. Let me check where Baba is located. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So I'm at that position. My goal is to reach the ""win"" at 9 right and up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and up. Maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule that lets me bypass the wall.

If I move the ""rule `is`"" block that's 1 step up to combine with ""wall"" or ""stop,"" maybe I can change their properties. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" could make ""wall is stop"" or something else. But I need to see where I can move the ""is"" block. The ""is"" is 1 step up from my current position. If I move up, I can get to that ""is"" block. Once I have it, I can carry it to another object like ""ball"" or ""win"" to create a new rule.

So the plan could be: move up to grab the ""is"" rule, then move right to the ""ball"" and create ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win object. Then go to the ball and touch it to win. Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""baba,"" but I'm already Baba, so that might not help.

But wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down, which is next to the ""is"" rule at 5 steps down. Maybe combining ""baba"" with ""you"" isn't necessary since ""baba is you"" is already active. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location could make ""win"" a different property.

Another angle: the ""door"" at 8 right and 2 down. Maybe I need to push it open, but there's a ""stop"" at 3 right and 2 down. So I can't move through that. Unless I change the ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then I could pass. But how?

Alternatively, use the ball to interact with the door. If the door requires a key, maybe the ball is the key. But I don't know the level's specifics. The key might be to rewrite the rules. Let's focus on moving the ""is"" block. If I move up once to get to the ""is"" block at 1 step up, then carry it to the ""ball"" at 8 right and 3 down. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the map.

From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving up would take me to the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Then, moving right multiple times. But walls are at 4 right and up, and others. Maybe need to navigate around. Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" location (9 right, 1 up) to make ""win"" a different object. For example, ""ball is win."" But how to get the ""is"" there.

Alternatively, create ""you is win"" so that being you means winning. But ""you"" is already active as ""baba is you."" Hmm.

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 right and 5 down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win,"" maybe make ""you is win."" But I need to position the ""is"" block between ""you"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 9 right and 1 up. From my current position, moving up to get the ""is"" block, then right to 8 right and 1 up (where the other ""is"" is), then move right again to 9 right and 1 up where ""win"" is. Place the ""is"" there between ""you"" and ""win,"" making ""you is win."" Then, since I'm you (Baba), touching anything that's you would win. But I'm already you. So maybe just standing there would win? Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""ball"" and make ""ball is win."" Then go push the ball to the win area. But the ball is at 8 right and 3 down. To get there, I need to move right from my current position (1 left, 5 down). Let's see: current position is rule `baba` at 1 left and 5 down. So I'm there. To move up to the ""is"" at 1 step up, then right to 8 right and 1 up (the other ""is""), then down or right. Maybe it's complicated.

Another possibility: use the ""door"" at 8 right and 2 down. If I can push the door open, maybe by making ""door is push"" or removing its ""stop"" property. But I need to interact with the ""stop"" rule at 3 right and 2 down. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the door isn't blocked. But moving ""stop"" would require carrying it, which might be possible since I'm you.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right and 2 down. If I can move that block to another location, then the door might be passable. But how? To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be able to push it. Since I'm defined as ""you,"" and unless there's a ""stop"" rule on me, I can move. But the ""stop"" rule is on the wall, not on me. So I can push the ""stop"" block. Let's see: from my position (1 left,5 down), moving right to 4 right and 5 down (a wall), then maybe up to 4 right and 4 down, then right to 5 right and 4 down, but not sure. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""is"" block to the ""ball"" to make it win. Let's try that. From my current position (1 left,5 down), move up once to get to the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Then move right multiple times: right to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 steps right and 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. So I can't go through that. So need to go around. Maybe move down from the ""is"" block to 1 step up and 5 down (my original position), then move right past the wall. Wait, the wall at 4 right and 1 up is above the current wall at 4 right. So maybe I can go around the wall by moving down to 4 right and 5 down, which is a wall, then right to 5 right and 5 down, but that's also a wall. Hmm.

This is getting tricky. Maybe another approach: use the existing ""win"" rule at 9 right and 1 up. If I can move the ""is"" block there to create a new rule. For example, ""baba is win,"" but I'm already Baba. If I make ""baba is win,"" then just touching me would win. But how to place the ""is"" there. The ""is"" block is currently at 1 step up. Moving up to get it, then right to 8 right and 1 up (another ""is""), then right again to 9 right and 1 up where ""win"" is. Place the ""is"" there between ""baba"" (which is at 1 left,5 down, but the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,5 down) and ""win."" So if I move the ""is"" block to 9 right and 1 up next to ""win,"" then create ""win is baba"" or ""baba is win."" But I need to have the ""baba"" rule nearby. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,5 down, which is far from 9 right and 1 up. So that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, create ""win is you,"" so since I'm you, touching the win object would win. To do that, move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you."" The ""you"" is at 1 right and 5 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right and 1 up. It's a long distance. Maybe not practical.

Perhaps the easiest way is to take the ""is"" block, move it to the ""ball,"" and make ""ball is win."" Then push the ball to the win area. Let's try that path. From my position (1 left,5 down), move up once to get the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Then move right: from 1 step up, right to 2,3,4 (wall at 4 right,1 up), so can't go through. So need to go around. Maybe move down from the ""is"" block to my original position, then move right past the walls. But there are walls at 4 right and down positions. This seems challenging.

Wait, maybe there's a way to move the ""is"" block to the ""ball"" by moving up, then right around the wall. For example, move up to the ""is"" block, then right to 2,3, then down to 2,3 steps right and 2 down. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 right and 2 down. So I can't move past that. Unless I change the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then maybe. But that requires carrying the ""stop"" block, which might be possible.

Alternatively, focus on the ""door"" at 8 right and 2 down. If I can push the door, maybe by making it not a stop. But the ""stop"" is at 3 right and 2 down, which is a different location. Maybe I need to remove the ""stop"" property from the door. But how? The door has a ""rule `door`"" at 8 right and 2 down. If I can change its property, but I don't have the ""is"" block nearby to do that.

This is getting too complicated. Let me recap. The key objects are the ""is"" blocks, which I can move to create new rules. My plan is to take an ""is"" block and place it next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" Then go push the ball to the win area. To do that, I need to navigate to the ball, which is at 8 right and 3 down. From my current position (1 left,5 down), moving right and down.

Let's see the path: from 1 left,5 down, move right to 0, then 1, 2, 3,4 (wall), so can't go through. So need to go around. Maybe up to 1 step up, right to 2,3, then down. But there's a wall at 4 right,1 up. Alternatively, move down from current position to 1 left,6 down, then right. But not sure.

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" block at 1 step up, then move right to 2,3, then down to 2,3 steps right and 1 down. But I'm not sure. This is getting too maze-like. Maybe the best immediate action is to move up to grab the ""is"" block, then try to move it towards the ball. But how?

Alternatively, since the ""win"" is at 9 right and 1 up, and there's a ""rule `win`"" there, maybe I can replace that rule by moving the ""is"" block next to it. For example, if I move the ""is"" block from 1 step up to 9 right and 1 up, placing it next to ""win,"" then I could create ""something is win."" But what ""something""? If I can get the ""ball"" next to it, then ""ball is win."" But the ball is at 8 right and 3 down, which is far away.

This seems too time-consuming. Maybe a simpler solution: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" and the goal is to reach the win, perhaps I can create a rule that makes touching the win object mean I win. For example, ""win is you,"" so since I'm you, touching win makes me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you."" The ""you"" is at 1 right and 5 down. The ""win"" is at 9 right and 1 up. It's a long way, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" so that just existing as Baba makes me win. To do that, move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 5 down, and ""win"" is at 9 right and 1 up. That's a big distance. Not feasible.

Another angle: the ""door"" at 8 right and 2 down. If I can make the door not a stop, then I can push it. But the ""stop"" is at 3 right and 2 down. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the door isn't blocked. So from my position, move to the ""stop"" block at 3 right and 2 down, push it somewhere else. But how? To push it, I need to move into it from an adjacent tile. From where? If I'm at 3 right and 2 down (the stop block's position), I can move left, right, up, or down. But the stop block is at 3 right and 2 down. My current position is 1 left and 5 down. To reach the stop block, I need to move right twice and down three times: from 1 left,5 down → 0 left,5 down → right to 1 left,5 down → right to 2 left,5 down → right to 3 left,5 down → down to 3 left,6 down → down to 3 left,7 down → down to 3 left,8 down → down to 3 left,9 down → but this seems impossible. Maybe another path.

Alternatively, move up from my current position to 1 left,4 down, then right to 2 left,4 down, etc. This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best action is to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 step up, grab it, and then try to maneuver it towards the ball or win.

So step-by-step:

1. Move up once to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step up.
2. Carry the ""is"" block to the ""ball"" at 8 right and 3 down.
3. Place the ""is"" block next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to create ""ball is win.""
4. Then push the ball to the ""win"" location at 9 right and 1 up.

But navigating there is challenging due to walls. Alternatively, after placing ""ball is win,"" just move towards the ball and touch it to win.

So the immediate action should be to move up to get the ""is"" block. Let me check if that's possible.

My current position is rule `baba` at 1 left and 5 down. The ""is"" block is 1 step up from here. So moving up once would place me at 1 left and 4 down, adjacent to the ""is"" block. Then I can take the ""is"" block.

Yes, that's doable. So the action would be ""up"" to move to the ""is"" block, then carry it right towards the ball.

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with things by moving the text blocks. The goal is usually to get to a ""win"" object, but I know I can change rules to alter that.

First, looking at the map, I see a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another rule ""is"" at 8 steps to the right. Maybe I can manipulate those rules to get past the walls. There's also a ""ball"" near the ""win"" area. Wait, the ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule closer or change what ""win"" refers to.

The ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can turn the ""door"" into a ""win,"" that might be a path. But how? The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win,"" maybe I can make ""door is win."" But I need to push the ""is"" rule there. 

Looking at movable objects: the player is Baba, and since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not stopped. The walls are defined as ""wall,"" and there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So I can't move walls or stop blocks directly. 

The ""is"" rule at 1 step up is movable. If I can move that ""is"" to the door's position, I could create ""door is win."" But how to get there? Let's see the positions. The player is currently at the starting point, probably at the initial position. Let me check where exactly. The first ""is"" is 1 step up, the ball is 1 step right and up, wall is 4 right and up. So maybe the player is at (0,0), and the first ""is"" is at (0,1). 

To move the ""is"" rule to the door at (8,2), I need to navigate there. But there's a wall at (4,1), so moving right directly might not work. Maybe I need to rearrange other rules. There's another ""is"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that one closer? Or maybe use the ball to push things? Wait, the ball is an object; if there's a rule that makes ball movable, but right now the only rule is ""baba is you."" So unless I change a rule to make ball pushable or movable, I can't use it to move other objects. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""is you"" or something else. Let's think. If I can make ""rule is push,"" then maybe I can push other rules. But there's no such rule now. The active rules are only ""baba is you."" 

Another approach: since ""baba"" is you, maybe I can turn myself into a ""win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" For example, if I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But the current ""win"" is at (9,1). How to get there? There's a wall at (4,1), so I need to remove that wall or make it passable. 

Looking at the rule ""wall is 1 step to the left."" That's probably a wall at (1,0). So the wall at (4,1) is defined by the ""wall is"" rule. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then the path to the right would be clear. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to another position, the wall at (4,1) would no longer exist. 

So the plan could be: move the ""wall is"" rule from (1,left) to somewhere else, thus removing the wall at (4,1). Then navigate right to the ""win"" area. To do that, I need to move the ""wall is"" rule. But how? The ""is"" rule is at (1,1). If I can grab that ""is"" and move it next to ""wall"" and another property. 

For example, if I move the ""is"" rule to be after ""wall"" and ""stop,"" creating ""wall is stop."" Then the wall at (4,1) would have the property ""stop,"" making it immovable, which doesn't help. Alternatively, moving the ""wall is"" rule elsewhere. Wait, the ""wall is"" rule is at 1 step to the left. So the rule is ""wall is [something]"". The current ""wall"" rule is at (1,left), which I think means the rule ""wall is"" is positioned there. To change what the wall is, I need to move that ""is"" rule. 

So if I take the ""is"" at (1,1) and move it to be after ""wall"" and ""stop,"" making ""wall is stop,"" then walls would be stop, meaning they can't be pushed. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, move the ""is"" to make ""wall is you,"" but that would make walls part of you, which might let you pass through them. Wait, if ""wall is you,"" then since you are Baba, you would be a wall, so you could move through walls. But is that possible? Let me check. 

If the rule is ""wall is you,"" and ""baba is you,"" then both Baba and walls are you. So you can push walls? Or can you move through them? In Baba Is You, if you are the same as an object, you can interact with it based on its properties. For example, if you are a stop, you can't be moved. But if you are a wall and you, maybe you can move through walls. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe creating ""wall is you"" would let you move through walls. 

Alternatively, to remove the wall at (4,1), I need to delete the ""wall is"" rule that's creating it. But how? The only way is to move or delete the text blocks. Since the ""wall is"" rule is at (1,left), which is a separate rule. If I can move that ""is"" to another position, like attaching it to a different subject. 

Wait, the current rules are:

- baba is you
- rule `is` 1 step up (this is the ""is"" block at (0,1))
- ball 1 step right and 1 step up (ball at (1,1))
- wall 4 steps right and 1 step up (wall at (4,1))
- rule `is` 8 steps right and 1 step up (another ""is"" at (8,1))
- rule `win` 9 steps right and 1 step up (win at (9,1))
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left (this is the ""wall is ..."" rule, probably at (1,0))
  
So the ""wall is"" rule is at (1,0), which defines that the wall at (1,0) is created by that rule. To remove the wall at (4,1), I need to either delete that rule or change what it defines. 

If I can move the ""wall is"" rule from (1,0) to another position, say attaching it to the ball, making ""ball is wall,"" then the ball would become a wall. But the wall at (4,1) is still there unless its defining rule is moved. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try a step-by-step approach. 

First, the player is likely at the starting position, maybe at (0,0). The initial ""is"" rule is at (0,1). If I move that ""is"" rule to the position of ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could create ""baba is win,"" making touching the win object win the game. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" from (0,1) to be next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at (1 step left and 5 steps down), which is probably ( -1,5). The ""win"" is at (9,1). So moving the ""is"" from (0,1) to between ""baba"" and ""win"" would create ""baba is win."" 

But how to navigate there? The path is blocked by walls. The wall at (4,1) is a problem. If I can remove that wall by moving its defining rule (""wall is"" at (1,0)), then I can move right. 

So step 1: Move the ""wall is"" rule from (1,0) to somewhere else. For example, attach it to the ball, making ""ball is wall."" Then the wall at (4,1) would still exist because its rule is elsewhere. Hmm, not helpful. 

Alternatively, move the ""wall is"" rule to attach to itself, but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, the ""wall is"" rule is at (1,0), which is a separate text block. If I can move that block to another position, like next to ""rule"" and ""win,"" making ""rule is win,"" then ""rule"" would be win. But that might not help directly. 

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""stop"" passable. But there's a ""stop"" rule at (3,2). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the ""stop"" block at (4,2) would no longer be a stop, allowing me to push through it. 

But how to move the ""is"" blocks? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not stopped. The ""is"" blocks are not stopped, so I can move them. 

So here's a possible plan:

1. Move the ""is"" block at (0,1) to the position of ""baba"" (which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down) and ""win"" (9,1). This would create ""baba is win,"" making touching the win object win the game. 

But the path to (9,1) is blocked by walls. So first, I need to remove the walls. 

2. To remove the wall at (4,1), I need to delete its defining rule, which is the ""wall is"" rule at (1,0). If I can move that ""wall is"" rule elsewhere, the wall at (4,1) will disappear. 

So, move the ""wall is"" rule from (1,0) to, say, next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" making ""ball is win."" Then the ball would become a win object, but the wall at (4,1) is still there because its rule was moved, not deleted. Wait, no—the ""wall is"" rule defines the wall at (4,1). If I move the ""wall is"" rule, the wall at (4,1) would no longer exist. 

Yes, exactly. So moving the ""wall is"" rule from (1,0) to another position would remove the wall at (4,1). 

So step 1: Move the ""wall is"" rule (which is at 1 step to the left, so likely at position (1,0)) to a new position. For example, attach it to ""rule"" and ""stop,"" making ""rule is stop."" Then the rule at (1,0) would be ""rule is stop,"" removing the original ""wall is"" rule. 

Once that's done, the wall at (4,1) is gone. 

Then, I can move right past the other walls to reach the ""win"" at (9,1). 

But how to move the ""wall is"" rule? The ""is"" block is part of that rule. The ""wall is"" rule consists of ""wall"" and ""is"" connected. To move the entire rule, I need to move both parts, but in the game, you can move individual text blocks. Wait, in Baba Is You, each part of a rule (subject and property) are separate blocks. So ""wall is"" is two blocks: ""wall"" and ""is."" To move the rule, you need to move both blocks together. 

But in the current observation, the ""wall is"" rule is at 1 step to the left. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" and a ""rule `is` 1 step up."" So these are separate blocks. To move the entire ""wall is"" rule, I need to move both the ""wall"" block and the ""is"" block that's connected to it. 

But the ""is"" block at 1 step up is separate. So maybe the ""wall is"" rule is composed of the ""wall"" block at (1,0) and the ""is"" block at (0,1)? That doesn't seem right. Maybe the ""wall is"" rule is at (1,0), which is the ""wall"" block, and the ""is"" block is at (0,1), which is another rule. This is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, the ""wall is"" rule is a single text block that says ""WALL IS"", but in the observation, it's listed as ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 1 step up."" So perhaps they are separate blocks. To recreate the ""wall is"" rule, you need both the ""wall"" block and the ""is"" block adjacent. 

So to move the ""wall is"" rule, I need to move both the ""wall"" block at (1,0) and the ""is"" block at (0,1) to a new position. But that's two separate blocks. Alternatively, maybe the ""wall is"" rule is a single block, but the observation splits it into subject and property. 

This is a bit unclear. Let's assume that each part of the rule is a separate block. So to delete the ""wall is"" rule, I need to move either the ""wall"" block or the ""is"" block away. 

If I move the ""wall"" block from (1,0) to elsewhere, then the ""wall is"" rule would be broken. For example, move the ""wall"" block to the right, making the rule "" [space] is"", which is inactive. 

So step 1: Move the ""wall"" block (which is part of the ""wall is"" rule) from 1 step to the left to a new position, say 2 steps to the left. This would break the ""wall is"" rule, removing the wall at (4,1). 

Once that's done, I can move right past the wall. 

Then, navigate to the ""win"" at (9,1). But there's a ""stop"" block at (3,2) and a ""stop"" rule at (3,2). If I can remove the ""stop"" property, I can pass through. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So the rule ""stop"" is there, making the wall at (4,2) a stop. To remove the stop property, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. 

So step 2: Move the ""stop"" rule from (3,2) to another position. For example, attach it to ""rule"" and ""door,"" making ""rule is door."" Then the stop property would be removed from the wall at (4,2), allowing me to push through. 

After that, I can move right to the ""win"" at (9,1). 

But how to move these rules? Since I'm Baba and can move any non-stop object, the ""is"" blocks are movable. 

So, first, move the ""wall"" block (from the ""wall is"" rule) at 1 step to the left to a new position. Let's say move it 1 step right, to 2 steps to the left. This would break the ""wall is"" rule, removing the wall at (4,1). 

Then, move the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down to another position, like attaching it to ""rule"" and ""win,"" making ""rule is win."" 

Once that's done, the path to the ""win"" should be clear. 

Alternatively, after removing the wall, navigate right, push past the stop block (since its stop property is removed), and reach the ""win"" area. 

But there's also a door at (8,2). If I can turn the door into a win, that might be an alternative path. 

Another approach: Use the ball to push things. But since the ball is an object, and the only movable thing is Baba (since ""baba is you""), unless I change a rule to make the ball movable. For example, create ""ball is push"" or ""ball is you."" 

If I can make the ball ""you,"" then I could push it to interact with other objects. 

To make ""ball is you,"" I need to create the rule ""ball is you."" The current ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" block to be next to ""ball"" and ""you,"" that would work. 

But the ""is"" blocks are scattered. The available ""is"" blocks are at (0,1) and (8,1). 

So, move the ""is"" at (8,1) to be next to ""ball"" (at 7,3) and ""you"" (at 1,5). That might be a bit far. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" at (0,1) to be next to ""ball"" and ""you."" The ball is at (7,3), and ""you"" is at (1,5). That's a significant distance. 

This seems complicated. Maybe focusing on removing the walls first is better. 

So, step-by-step:

1. Move the ""wall"" block (from ""wall is"") at 1 step left to 2 steps left. This breaks the ""wall is"" rule, removing the wall at (4,1). 

2. Move the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down to another position, like attaching it to ""rule"" and ""win,"" making ""rule is win."" This removes the stop property from the wall at (4,2). 

3. Now, navigate right past the walls. From the starting position (assuming it's at (0,0)), move right until I reach the ""win"" at (9,1).

58,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to figure out what action to take here. Let me start by understanding the current state of the game.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but since I can change rules, maybe I need to adjust that.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a ""rule `is`"" to the left and up. That might be useful for modifying other rules.
- A ""ball"" is up and to the right.
- A ""win"" rule is way to the right at 9 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, which might require a key or something. Also, there's a ""stop"" wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which I can't pass through normally.
- ""Baba"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and there's a ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" there. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe I can pick up the ""you"" or ""is"" rules to change my properties.

My current position isn't explicitly stated, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I must be at the ""baba"" object's location, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" is at that position. Maybe I need to move towards the ""win"" rule.

Looking at the possible actions, I need to move either up, down, left, right, or idle. Let's think about the path to the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right, and another at 3 steps right and 2 steps down (which is a stop wall). So moving directly right would hit walls. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules.

The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up could be moved. If I can grab that ""is"" rule and place it next to another object to create a new rule, like making the ball a win or removing the stop property from a wall. For example, if I take the ""is"" rule and place it with ""ball"" and ""win,"" that could make ""ball is win,"" allowing me to push the ball to the win spot. Alternatively, making ""stop is nothing"" would make stop walls passable.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't defined as stop or similar. The ""rule `is`"" is a text block, so unless there's a rule saying it's stop, I can move it. Let me check the active rules. The only stop rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So I can move the ""is"" rule.

If I move the ""is"" rule to the ""ball"" and ""win"" positions, creating ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it a win. Then I could move towards the ball and win condition. Alternatively, moving ""is"" to the ""stop"" wall to create ""stop is nothing,"" removing its stop property.

Let's consider the steps:

1. Move up to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. From my position at 5 steps down, moving up once gets me there.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule and carry it to the ""ball"" which is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule's current position. So from ""is"" at 1 step up, move right to reach the ball, then place the ""is"" next to the ball and the ""win"" rule to create ""ball is win.""
3. Once that rule is active, moving to the ball would satisfy the win condition.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" to the ""stop"" wall to neutralize it. But the ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. That's a bit further.

But first, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule. My current position is likely at the ""baba"" rule's location, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down. To get to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, I need to move up once. Then, from there, move right to reach the ball. Let me confirm the positions:

- ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up from the start position (assuming start is where baba is). Then the ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from there. So moving up to the ""is"" rule, then right to the ball.

Once at the ball, I can place the ""is"" rule to make ""ball is win."" Then, moving to the ball would make it a win. But how do I get to the ball after placing the rule? The path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, if I make the door the win condition, but the door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. That's a different location.

Alternatively, maybe creating ""you is baba"" to reinforce that I'm the player, but that's already the case.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can move rules, maybe I can turn a wall into a path. For example, if there's a ""wall"" rule, I can move it away or change its property. But the ""wall"" rules are at 1 step left and 7 steps right and 1 step up. Not sure.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule to the ""you"" rule to create ""you is win,"" making myself the win condition. If I can place ""you is win"" next to each other, then touching myself would win. But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. That's quite far.

Alternatively, focus on the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, but that might require removing the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, the door might become passable. But moving the ""stop"" rule would require going there, which is a bit involved.

Let me recap the possible steps:

1. Move up once to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up.
2. Move right to get to the ball (1 step right and 1 step up from ""is"").
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""win"" rule (which is at 9 steps right and 1 step up) to create ""ball is win.""
4. Then move right towards the ball, which is now a win.

But between the ball and the win, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So even if the ball becomes win, accessing it might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe the path changes if the wall's property is altered.

Alternatively, create ""wall is nothing"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""nothing."" But there's no ""nothing"" rule here. Hmm.

Alternatively, focus on the door. If I can make the door a win, then reach it. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. To do that, I need to place ""door is win"" somewhere. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So moving the ""is"" rule to the door's position and the ""win"" rule's position to create that rule.

But that would require moving multiple objects, which might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule at 9 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make that reachable, perhaps by removing walls.

Looking at the walls: at 4 steps right, 1 step up (a wall), and at 3 steps right and 2 steps down (a stop wall). The stop wall is blocking the path towards the right.

If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the stop wall, then it becomes passable. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""stop is nothing."" To do that, I need the ""is"" rule, a ""stop"" object, and a ""nothing"" object. But there's no ""nothing"" on the map. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, create ""stop is you,"" but that might not help. Or ""stop is baba,"" but that could trap me.

Another idea: Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can push objects. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects if the ""push"" rule is active. But the current rules only have ""baba is you."" So unless I create a ""push"" rule, I can't push things. But creating ""push is you"" would allow me to push. But that requires moving the ""is"" rule next to ""push"" and ""you."" However, there's no ""push"" or ""you"" rule here except the existing ""you"" at 5 steps down.

Wait, the existing ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to create ""push is you,"" then I could push walls. But that's a two-step process: first move the ""is"" rule, then move the ""you"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

First, priority: reach the win condition. The win rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. Direct path is blocked by walls. So need to alter rules to make the path clear or change the win condition.

Option 1: Make the ball the win condition. To do this, place ""ball is win"" next to each other. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule. The win rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So after picking up the ""is"" rule (from 1 step up), move right to the ball, place ""is"" next to ball and win. But how to get the ""win"" rule to be near? The ""win"" rule is far to the right. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule closer, but that would require pushing, which I can't do yet.

Option 2: Make myself the win. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" if I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to place ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Option 3: Remove the stop property from the stop wall. As mentioned before, but requires ""nothing"" which isn't present.

Option 4: Use the door. If I can create ""door is win,"" then reach the door. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So moving the ""is"" rule to the door and the ""win"" rule to create ""door is win."" But the ""win"" rule is far away. Alternatively, move the ""door"" next to the ""win"" rule, but again, no push rule.

Alternative approach: Maybe the key is to move the ""you"" rule. The existing ""you"" is at 5 steps down, 1 step to the right. If I can move that ""you"" rule to the ""win"" rule, making ""you is win,"" then since I'm ""you,"" touching anything that is ""you"" would win. But I'm already ""you,"" so maybe that's redundant.

Alternatively, create ""win is you,"" making me the win. But again, positioning the ""is"" rule between ""win"" and ""you.""

This is tricky. Let's focus on the immediate possible actions. The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move up, I can grab it. Then move right to the ball, place the ""is"" next to ball and win. But the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is."" So from the ""is"" at 1 step up, move right once to reach the ball. Then, move right again towards the win rule, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So even if the ball is win, I can't reach it because of the wall.

Alternatively, move the wall. But without a push rule, I can't push it. So need to create a push rule. To create ""push is you,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""push"" and ""you."" But there's no ""push"" rule on the map. So that's not possible.

Wait, the objects on the map include ""wall,"" ""ball,"" ""door,"" ""stop,"" and the rules. There's no ""push"" object. So creating a push rule isn't feasible here.

Alternative idea: Use the existing ""stop"" rule. If I can make ""stop is baba,"" then the stop walls would affect me, but I'm Baba. But that seems counterproductive. Or ""stop is wall,"" which is redundant.

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to push the ball to the win spot. Since I can move text blocks, but not objects by default. Unless I create a ""push"" rule. But as above, no ""push"" object exists.

Wait, the ball is an object. If I can make the ball pushable, but again, requires a rule.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ball. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. The ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. That's a distance of 8 steps right. Without being able to push, I can't move the ""win"" rule there.

This is getting stuck. Let me try to think differently. What if I create a new rule that makes the wall not a wall? For example, ""wall is nothing."" To do that, I need the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""nothing."" But there's no ""nothing.""

Alternatively, ""wall is ball."" Then walls would act like balls. But I'm not sure if that helps. If walls become passable like balls, then I could move through them. But the ball is a separate object.

Alternatively, ""ball is wall."" Then the ball would act like a wall, blocking me. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe ""you is win."" Since I'm ""you,"" if I make ""you is win,"" then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to place ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win."" The ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, 1 step to the right. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a far distance. How to get there?

I would need to move the ""is"" rule to that position, but it's too far. Alternatively, move the ""you"" and ""win"" rules closer, but again, no push rule.

Alternatively, create ""win is you"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""you."" The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up, ""you"" is at 5 steps down, 1 step right. Not adjacent. Can't place them next to each other.

This is really challenging. Let me recap the possible actions and nearby objects:

- I'm at the ""baba"" rule's position: 1 step left, 5 steps down.
- The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from here.
- The ball is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""is"" rule.
- The ""win"" rule is far to the right.
- The ""stop"" wall is at 3 steps right, 2 steps down.

Maybe the quickest way is to move the ""is"" rule to the ball and make it win. Even if the path is blocked, perhaps the win condition is just being adjacent to the ball, regardless of obstacles. But in Baba Is You, the win condition usually requires touching the win object directly, without barriers.

Wait, no. The win object must be reachable. So if the ball is behind a wall, I need to remove the wall or find another way around.

Alternatively, use the door. The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, then I could go through it. But how?

If I can create ""door is win,"" then reaching the door would win. To do that, I need to place ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win."" The door is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, the win is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. Not adjacent. So can't place them next to each other.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. But without a push rule, can't move it.

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to focus on moving the ""is"" rule to the ""you"" and ""win"" to create ""you is win."" Even if they're not adjacent, but in Baba Is You, rules are global, not location-based. Wait, no. Rules are created by placing text blocks next to each other. For example, ""baba is you"" is a rule formed by placing ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then ""you.""

So to create ""you is win,"" I need to have the ""you"" text block, ""is"" text block, and ""win"" text block adjacent in that order.

The existing ""you"" is at 5 steps down, 1 step right. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right, 1 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up. So it's not possible to place them adjacent.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the solution is to push the ""win"" rule closer. But without a push rule, I can't push. Unless I create a ""push"" rule first.

To create ""push is you,"" I need to have the ""push"" text block. But there's no ""push"" object on the map. So that's not possible.

Wait, the objects listed are rule `is`, ball, wall, door, stop, and the rules for those. So no ""push"" object exists. Therefore, can't create a push rule.

Alternative Plan: Let's try to make the ball a win. Even if I can't reach it, maybe the game allows it if the rule is set. So:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.
2. Move right to the ball (1 step right and 1 step up from ""is"").
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ball","

Let's tackle this Baba Is You puzzle. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I'm controlling Baba. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. However, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another wall at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Between me (Baba) and the ""win"" position, there's a sequence of walls and stop blocks. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which I can't move past because it's immovable. 

Wait, but maybe I can manipulate the rules. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule somewhere else, I might be able to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But first, I need to figure out how to move the text blocks.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from my current position. If I move up once, I can grab that ""is"" rule. But wait, can I move? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move unless there's a ""stop"" or similar property blocking. Let me check the path. Moving up from my current position (which seems to be at the original starting point, but need to confirm coordinates based on the observations). The map has various walls and rules spread out. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can reach that door, maybe I can use it to get past the walls. But the door is behind some stop blocks. Hmm. 

Another approach: The ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule there. Let's see. The current ""is"" rule at 1 step up. If I move up to grab it, then move right 7 steps (since it's at 8 steps right now, so from my position, moving right 7 each time), but there are walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the walls are blocking that path. 

Wait, perhaps the key is to use the existing rules. If I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would work. To do that, I need to rearrange the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at 1 step up. If I move up to get it, then move right and down to place it next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But I need to check if the path is clear. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to make the walls passable. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is nothing,"" then I could walk through the walls. But to do that, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left."" That might be the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that ""wall"" rule and change its property, but that requires placing a new ""wall is [property]"" rule. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me recap:

- Active rule: baba is you.
- Goal: reach win, but it's blocked by walls and stop blocks.
- Available rules: multiple ""is"" rules, ""win"" at 9 right 1 up, ""wall"" rules, ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball.""
- Possible actions: move up, down, left, right to rearrange rules.

So, the plan might be:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, pick it up, and then move to where I want to place it. For example, next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
2. To do that, navigate from my current position. Let's assume my position is at (0,0). The ""is"" rule is at (0,1). Moving up once to grab it. Then move right to reach the ""win"" position at (9,1). But between here and there, there's a wall at (4,1). So I can't go directly right. Maybe another path.

Alternatively, place the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" which is at (1 left, 5 down) according to some observations. Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So maybe my position is at (1,5)? Not sure about the exact coordinates, but the key is that the ""baba"" text block is at that position, and the ""you"" rule is nearby.

Alternatively, focus on the ball. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it the win condition. The ball is at 8 right 3 down. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 up to be next to ""ball"" and ""win."" So from (0,1), move right to 8 right, down to 3 down. But there are walls at 4 right and various steps. 

This seems challenging. Maybe another angle: the ""door"" at 8 right 2 down. If I can make the door passable by changing its property. But to do that, I need to manipulate the rules related to door. 

Alternatively, use the ""stop"" rule at 3 right 2 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that block, then it becomes passable. To do that, I might need to create a new rule that says ""stop is nothing"" or something. But that requires having the ""is"" rule in the right place.

Wait, here's an idea. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up. If I move that ""is"" rule to the position next to ""stop"" and change its property. For example, create ""stop is you,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, make ""stop is nothing."" But I need to have the ""is"" rule adjacent to ""stop"" and the new property.

Alternatively, focus on the existing ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down. If I can change ""you"" to something else, but that's part of the active rule ""baba is you.""

Hmm. Maybe the key is to get to the ""win"" at 9 right 1 up. To get there, I need to move right past the walls. But there's a wall at 4 right 1 up. If I can make that wall passable by changing its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left. So if I can move that ""wall"" rule and change its property to something else, like ""wall is nothing,"" then the wall becomes passable.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 up.
2. Pick it up and move left to the ""wall"" rule at 2 left.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and create a new rule like ""wall is nothing.""
4. Now, the wall at 4 right 1 up is no longer a wall, so I can move right past it.
5. Then proceed to the ""win"" at 9 right 1 up.

But how to execute this movement? Let's map out the path.

Assuming my initial position is at (0,0):

- The ""is"" rule is at (0,1). Move up once to grab it.
- From (0,1), move left to reach the ""wall"" rule at 2 left, which would be at (-2,1).
- Place the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" to create ""wall is nothing.""
- Now, the wall at (4,1) is gone.
- Move right from (0,1) past the now passable wall to (9,1) where ""win"" is.

But wait, there's another wall at 4 right, but if we changed the ""wall"" rule, all walls would become nothing. So that's the plan.

So the sequence of actions would be:

up (to grab the ""is"" rule at 1 up)
left (moving to 2 left position where the ""wall"" rule is)
left again? Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. So from my position (0,0), moving left twice gets to (-2,0). But the ""wall"" rule is at 2 left, which might be at (-2,1) if the ""is"" rule is at (0,1). Wait, coordinates might be tricky here. Need to clarify.

Alternatively, maybe the ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps to the left from the current position. If I'm at (0,0), then 2 steps left is (-2,0). But the ""is"" rule is at (0,1). So moving up to (0,1), then left to (-2,1) to reach the ""wall"" rule. Then place the ""is"" rule next to it to create ""wall is nothing.""

Once that's done, the walls are gone, and I can move right to the ""win"" position.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the ""wall"" rule because of other obstacles, then this path might not work.

Another possibility: Use the ""door"" at 8 right 2 down. If I can make the door not a stop, then I can go through it. But to do that, need to change the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right 2 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there and create ""stop is nothing,"" then the door becomes passable.

So steps:

up (to get ""is"" at 1 up)
right 3 times (to reach 3 right, 1 up) but there's a wall at 4 right 1 up. Wait, maybe not. If the walls are now passable after changing the ""wall"" rule, then this path is possible.

This is getting really complex. Maybe the simplest solution is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" text block is at 1 left 5 down. So from my current position (assuming it's at (0,0)), moving left to (-1,5) to reach the ""baba"" rule. But that's a long way. Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right 5 down, which is closer.

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. So if I can change ""you"" to ""win,"" but that's part of the active rule ""baba is you."" So maybe not.

Alternatively, the ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up. If I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But ""baba"" is at 1 left 5 down, which is quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""baba"" text block. Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So that's the ""baba"" noun, and the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which is separate.

So to create ""baba is win,"" I need to have the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,5). That's a significant distance. Maybe not feasible.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 8 right 3 down. If I make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it the win condition. To do that, move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""ball"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up, and the ball is at 8 right 3 down. So placing the ""is"" rule somewhere in between. Maybe moving the ""is"" from 1 up to 8 right 3 down area. But there are walls and stop blocks in the way.

Alternatively, use the existing ""door"" at 8 right 2 down. If I can make the door lead to the win condition. But I'm not sure how.

This is really challenging. Let's try to outline the possible steps again, focusing on the most straightforward path:

1. Grab the ""is"" rule at 1 up.
2. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 2 left to change it to ""wall is nothing.""
3. Now, walls are passable.
4. Move right past the wall at 4 right 1 up to reach the ""win"" at 9 right 1 up.

So the actions would be:

up (to pick up the ""is"" rule)
left (twice to reach the ""wall"" rule at 2 left)
place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" to create ""wall is nothing""
then right multiple times to reach the ""win""

But need to check if the path is clear after changing the wall rule.

Assuming after changing ""wall is nothing,"" all walls become passable. So moving right from (0,1) past (4,1) is now possible.

So the sequence of actions:

up (to grab ""is"" at 1 up)
left (move to 2 left, which is (-2,1))
left again? Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left from where? From the current position after grabbing the ""is"" rule at (0,1). So moving left twice would get to (-2,1). Place the ""is"" there next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is nothing.""

Then move right from (0,1) to (9,1), passing through the previously blocked wall at (4,1).

Once there, since ""win"" is at (9,1), and the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" touching the win object should make me win.

So the actions needed are:

up (to grab the ""is"" rule)
left (twice to reach the ""wall"" rule)
place the ""is"" next to ""wall""
right (eight times to reach the win)

But how to input these actions? The system might require a single action per step. So each move is one step.

Let me think step by step:

1. Current position: Assume at (0,0).
2. Objects:
   - rule `is` at (0,1)
   - ball at (1,1)
   - wall at (4,1)
   - rule `is` at (8,1)
   - rule `win` at (9,1)
   - etc.

3. First action: move up to (0,1) to grab the ""is"" rule.
4. Now, move left to reach the ""wall"" rule at (-2,0) or (-2,1)? The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left. If the ""wall"" rule is at ( -2, 0 ), then from (0,1), move left to (-1,1), then (-2,1). But the ""wall"" rule's position is 2 step to the left, so likely at (-2,0) if the starting point is (0,0). This is getting confusing without exact coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps to the left from the current position. So from (0,0), moving left twice gets to (-2,0). But the ""is"" rule is at (0,1). So moving up to (0,1), then left twice to (-2,1). Place the ""is"" there next to the ""wall"" rule to create ""wall is nothing.""

Once that's done, move right from (0,1) to (9,1).

But each action is a single step. So the sequence would be:

up (to get ""is"" at (0,1))
left (to (-1,1))
left (to (-2,1))
place ""is"" next to ""wall"" at (-2,1) to create ""wall is nothing""
right (to (-1,1))
right (to (0,1))
... and so on until reaching (9,1)

But placing the ""is"" requires moving it adjacent to the ""wall"" rule. So from (-2,1), move right to (-1,1) next to the ""wall"" rule, then place the ""is"" there.

So the exact steps would be:

1. up
2. left
3. left
4. right (to be adjacent to the ""wall"" rule at (-1,1))
5. place (but how is placing done? The system might require moving the ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule and then the action is considered as creating the new rule.)
6. Then proceed right to the ""win""

But the system might not have a ""place"" action, just move up, down, left, right. So moving the ""is"" rule adjacent to the ""wall"" rule and the new property would be formed by their positions.

Assuming that, the actions would be:

up (grab ""is"" at (0,1))
left (to (-1,1))
left (to (-2,1))
right (to (-1,1)) now adjacent to ""wall"" rule at (-2,1)
right again (to (0,1)) but that's not adjacent. Wait, maybe after moving left twice to (-2,1), then move right once to (-1,1) which is next to the ""wall"" rule. Then the ""is"" is at (-1,1) and ""wall"" is at (-2,1), so creating ""wall is nothing"" rule.

Then move right from (-1,1) to (0,1), then continue right to (9,1).

But this is getting too detailed. The main point is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule to change its property, making walls passable, then move right to the ""win.""

Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to move right to approach the ""win"" position, assuming that the walls are no longer a problem after changing the rule. But how to confirm?

Alternatively, the current observation shows that the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" and the ""win"" is at 9 right 1 up. If I can move right towards it, but there's a wall at","

60,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and manipulate other text blocks since I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach ""win,"" but in this case, the ""win"" object is 9 steps to the right at the top. There are walls blocking the path directly.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" to combine with another object, like ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it a win. Alternatively, changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"" might make me the win condition. But I need to check if that's possible.

First, I need to get to the ""is"" block. To do that, I'm currently at position where the ""is"" is 1 step up. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" moving up should be possible if there's no wall. Let me check the walls. There's a wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, but that's to the right of the ""is"" block. So moving up from my current position (assuming I'm next to the ""is"" block) should be possible.

Wait, the ""is"" block is 1 step up. So I'm probably one step below it. If I move up once, I can pick up the ""is"" block. Once I have that, I can move it to combine with another object. For example, if I move the ""is"" to the ""ball"" that's 1 step to the right and 1 step up, then creating ""ball is win"" would make the ball a win. Then I could go to the ball and win.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" to the ""baba"" rule at the bottom (1 step to the left and 5 steps down) to make ""baba is win."" But that might be further away.

Another option: There's a ""door"" 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe unlocking it with a key, but I don't see a key here. So probably not useful right now.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make ""stop"" into something else, but that might not help immediately.

So the immediate plan is to move up to the ""is"" block, take it, then move right to the ball and combine them into ""ball is win."" Then go to the ball to win.

But how to execute that step by step. Let's see:

Current position: Assuming I'm at the same position as the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. Wait, no. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. But the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I must be Baba's position. Wait, maybe I'm on the same tile as the ""baba"" rule? Or is the ""baba"" rule separate?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map.

Looking at the objects:

- The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up. So maybe above the starting point.
- The ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so diagonally up-right from the ""is"" block.
- Walls are spread out to the right and down.
- The ""win"" is way to the right at the top.
- At the bottom-left, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and a ""rule `is`"" there, and ""rule `you`"" to the right of that.

So perhaps the layout is such that moving up from the bottom-left (where the ""baba"" rule is) gets me to the ""is"" block. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, which is blocking the direct path to the top ""win.""

So to reach the top ""win,"" I need to either remove the walls or find a way around. But walls are defined as ""wall,"" and I can't move them unless they don't have a ""stop"" or similar property. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a wall that's stoppable. But since I'm ""you"" (Baba), I can push objects that aren't stop.

Wait, the rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can push objects that aren't defined as ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a wall. So that wall is stoppable, meaning I can't push it. Other walls might be movable if they don't have ""stop.""

But the main path to the top is blocked by a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I could make that wall into something else, like removing its ""wall"" property, then I could pass through.

Alternatively, using the door at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. But I don't have a key, so that's not useful yet.

So back to the ""is"" block. If I can move it to combine with ""ball"" to make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. Let's try that.

First, move up to the ""is"" block. From my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location: 1 step left and 5 steps down), moving up 5 steps would get me to the ""is"" block at 1 step up. Wait, no. The ""is"" block is 1 step up from where? Maybe from the starting position. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I'm next to the ""is"" block. If the ""is"" block is 1 step up, then moving up once would reach it. Once I take the ""is"" block, then I can move right to the ball which is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So from the ""is"" block, move right to get to the ball, then place the ""is"" next to the ball to create ""ball is win.""

Once that rule is active, the ball becomes the win object. Then I can move to the ball and win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move up to take the ""is"" block.
2. Move right to the ball's position.
3. Place the ""is"" next to the ball to create ""ball is win.""
4. Move to the ball (now win) and victory.

But how to navigate there without hitting walls. Let's check the path.

From the ""is"" block (1 step up), moving right would take me towards the ball. But between the ""is"" block and the ball, is there a wall? The ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up from the ""is"" block. So if I'm at the ""is"" block, moving right once gets me to the ball's position. But need to check if there's a wall there. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, which is further to the right. So between the ""is"" block and the ball's position, there's no wall. So that's clear.

So the plan is feasible. Let's execute it step by step.

First action: move up to pick up the ""is"" block. Then move right to the ball, place the ""is"" there to make ""ball is win,"" then move right again to the ball (now win) and win.

But in the observation, after moving up, the ""is"" block would be on my current tile, and I can take it. Then move right, place it next to the ball. Then move to the ball.

So the actions needed are: up, right, right (if necessary), then right again to the ball. Wait, the ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up from the ""is"" block. So if I'm at the ""is"" block (1 step up), moving right once gets me to the ball's position. Then placing the ""is"" there would create the new rule. Then move right again to the ball, which is now the win.

But I need to confirm the positions. Let's assume that after moving up, I'm on the same tile as the ""is"" block. Then I can take it. Then move right to the ball's tile, place the ""is"" next to it (either to the left or right?), creating ""ball is win."" Then move to the ball.

So the exact sequence would be:

1. up (to get the ""is"" block)
2. right (to the ball's position)
3. place the ""is"" block adjacent to the ball (either left or right)
4. move right to the ball (which is now win)

But in the game, when you place a text block next to an object, you combine them into a new rule. So placing ""is"" next to ""ball"" would make ""ball is ..."", but we need to determine the position. If the ""is"" is placed to the right of the ball, then it would be ""ball is win"" if there's a ""win"" block, but here we need to create ""ball is win"" by placing ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" somewhere. Wait, no. The ""win"" block is already at 9 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe we don't need to involve that.

Wait, the standard way is to create a rule by placing ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So to make ""ball is win,"" we need the ""ball"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block adjacent in that order.

But in this case, the ""win"" block is far to the right. So perhaps it's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe we can make ""ball is win"" by placing ""is"" between ""ball"" and ""win"" in the same row or column.

But given the current positions, the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up, while the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up. The ""is"" block is at 1 step up. So if I move the ""is"" block to the right next to the ball, and then have the ""win"" block somewhere adjacent, but the ""win"" is far away.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to make ""baba is win"" instead. Since I'm Baba, if I can make that rule, then touching any Baba (which is me) would make me win.

To do that, I need to take the ""is"" block and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and the ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a ""baba"" text block somewhere else.

Wait, the objects include ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So if I can get the ""is"" block to that area and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be created.

But that would require moving the ""is"" block all the way down to the ""baba"" rule, then right to the ""win"" which is at the top right. That seems impractical due to the walls in between.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's think differently.

Another idea: The ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, then maybe I can push through. But I don't know how to do that.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from that wall, then it becomes movable. But to do that, I need to create a rule like ""stop is nothing"" or similar. But I don't have a ""nothing"" block.

Alternatively, create a rule that negates ""stop"". For example, ""stop is not stop"", but I don't think that's possible in Baba Is You.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's go back to the original plan of making ""ball is win"".

To do that, I need the ""ball"", ""is"", and ""win"" adjacent. The ""win"" is far to the right, so maybe I can't reach it. Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" rule is already present, so if I can associate ""ball"" with ""win"" using the ""is"" block.

Wait, the active rules include ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So the ""win"" text block is there. If I can place ""ball is win"" by putting ""is"" between ""ball"" and ""win"", then the ball becomes win.

But the ball is at 1 step right and 1 step up, and the win is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So they are in the same row, separated by walls. The path between them is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So I can't move the ball directly to the win.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" block closer, but I don't have the ability to move it because it's a rule and I might not have the ""you"" property for it. Wait, no, ""win"" is a object defined by the rule, and since I'm ""you"" (Baba), I can move it unless it's stopped. The ""win"" block's position is at 8 steps right and 1 step up, and there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but that's a separate wall.

This is tricky. Maybe another approach: Use the existing ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to somewhere else, but I'm already ""you"", so that might not help.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is a text block that defines what is ""you"". Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", moving the ""you"" rule might change the ""you"" property. For example, if I move the ""you"" rule to point to ""ball"", then the ball becomes ""you"", and I can then move the ball to the win.

So steps for that:

1. Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down.
2. Take the ""you"" rule.
3. Move to the ball's position (1 step right and 1 step up).
4. Place the ""you"" rule there, creating ""ball is you"".
5. Now, the ball is ""you"", so I can move it.
6. Push the ball to the win (9 steps right and 1 step up), avoiding the walls.

This could work. Let's see:

- Move down to the ""you"" rule's position (since current position is maybe at the bottom-left).
- Take the ""you"" block.
- Move up to the ball's location.
- Place ""you"" next to the ball to make ""ball is you"".
- Then, as ""you"" (the ball), move right past the walls. But the path to the win is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up. However, if I can make those walls not stoppable, or push them.

But pushing the walls would require that they aren't ""stop"". The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up has no ""stop"" property mentioned, so I can push it. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a different wall. The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up is just a regular wall. So I can push it.

So after making the ball ""you"", I can push the ball right, pushing the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up out of the way, then continue to the win.

But this requires multiple steps and navigating around.

Alternatively, after making the ball ""you"", move the ball to the win's position. But the distance is large and there are walls. Maybe possible by pushing.

But this is getting complex. Let's try to outline the steps clearly.

Alternative Plan:

1. Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down.
2. Take the ""you"" block.
3. Move up to the ball's position (1 step right and 1 step up).
4. Place the ""you"" block next to the ball to create ""ball is you"".
5. Now, as the ball, move right, pushing any movable walls in the way.
6. Navigate to the ""win"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up.

But how to move from the ball's position to the win. The path is blocked by a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Since I'm the ball (now ""you""), I can push that wall if it's not stopped. Since the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up doesn't have a ""stop"" property, I can push it.

So steps after step 4:

5. Move right from the ball's position (now at 1 step right and 1 step up) to 2 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, so need to push it.

Wait, the wall is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right multiple times:

From the ball's position (1 right, 1 up):

- Move right to 2 right, 1 up (empty).
- Move right to 3 right, 1 up (empty).
- Move right to 4 right, 1 up (wall).
- Since the wall is not stopped, I can push it. So push the wall to the right (5 right, 1 up), then I can move past it.

But this requires being the ball and having the ability to push. Once I'm the ball, I can push the wall.

So after becoming the ball, the sequence would be:

- Move right three times to reach the wall.
- Push the wall right once.
- Continue moving right to the win.

This might work.

So the overall actions would be:

1. Down three times to reach the ""you"" rule (assuming current position is at the top).
Wait, no. The initial position isn't specified. This is getting too ambiguous without knowing the agent's starting position.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is initially at the same position as the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down. So to get to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down, the agent needs to move right once.

Let me try to map this out step by step.

61,up,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure this out. The current observation shows that I'm a Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you."" So, I can move around unless there's a STOP or something like that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" at 9 steps to the right on the first row. But there's also a ""wall"" at 4 steps to the right on the same row, and another wall further right. Then there's a ""stop"" block at 3 steps right and 2 down. The ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 down, and the ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 3 down. 

The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can move. My current position isn't specified, but since the first rule is ""is"" 1 step up, maybe I'm below that? Or perhaps the player starts at a specific spot. Assuming I need to reach the ""win"" block, which is far to the right. But there are walls in between. 

The ""door"" might be a way through if I can interact with it. But how? The ""ball"" is near the door. Maybe I need to move the ball to somewhere? Or perhaps change the rules. Since I can move text blocks that aren't STOP, maybe I can grab the ""is"" rule and rewrite something. 

Looking at the lower part, there's a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 5 steps down, and a ""baba is"" rule there. If I can get to that area, maybe I can change ""baba is you"" to something else. For example, making ""baba is win"" so that touching a win object would make me win. Or turning ""win is push"" so I can push it. But how to do that?

First, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 5 steps down. To get there, I have to move down from my current position. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: from the starting point (assuming I'm at the first ""is"" rule which is 1 step up), moving right towards the walls. Wait, the first row has walls at 4 steps right, so if I'm somewhere left of that, maybe I can go right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to the ""is"" rule at the top and rewrite it. For example, changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and change the property. 

The ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I move up to that block, I can push it somewhere else. But wait, can I push it? The rules say I can only move objects not defined as STOP. The current rules are ""baba is you,"" so nothing is STOP except the ""stop"" block at 3 right, 2 down. So, the ""is"" blocks can be moved. 

If I move the top ""is"" block next to ""baba"" (which is at 1 step left and 5 steps down?), wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 5 steps down. So, if I can get the ""is"" block to be adjacent to ""baba,"" then I can change the rule to ""baba is [something else]."" 

But how to get there? From the initial position, maybe moving down step by step. Let's see: the active rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely except where STOP is. The path down might be clear. Let me try to plan a path:

1. Move down from the starting position (assuming I'm at the top ""is"" rule) to reach the area with ""baba"" and ""is"" at 5 steps down.
2. Once there, move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and change it to ""win"" or another property.
3. Then, the new rule would make me the win condition, allowing me to stand on the ""win"" block.

Alternatively, maybe push the ""win"" block somewhere. But ""win"" is a property, not an object I can push directly. 

Another idea: use the ""ball"" to interact with the door. If I can move the ball to the door, maybe it opens? But I don't know the rules for doors. Typically, in Baba Is You, a door might require a key or to be pushed. But since I can't see a key here, maybe not. 

Alternatively, create a ""door is you"" rule so that the door becomes passable. But to do that, I need to find the ""is"" block and move it next to ""door"" and change its property. 

So, steps could be:

- Move to the ""is"" block at 5 steps down.
- Push it to be next to ""door,"" making ""door is you,"" allowing me to go through it.
- Then move to the door and pass through to reach the ""win"" block beyond.

But how to navigate there without getting blocked by walls. The path to the door at 8 steps right, 2 down is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to move horizontally first. 

This is getting complicated. Let's focus on the immediate actions. The previous attempts kept getting invalid actions, maybe because the assistant didn't specify the direction correctly. For example, ""up"" might not be the right step. 

Looking at the current observation, the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. If I'm adjacent to it, moving up would take me there. But where am I located? The observation doesn't specify the player's position, only the objects. Assuming the player is near the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down, maybe I need to move down to get there. 

Alternatively, the player is at the initial position near the top ""is"" rule. Let's assume that. So, to get to the ""is"" at 5 steps down, I need to move down four times. But the path might be clear. Let's check the walls. The walls are at 4 steps right on the first row, and others further down. If I'm moving vertically, the horizontal position might not have walls blocking. 

So, the action could be ""down"" repeated multiple times. But the assistant is supposed to output a single action. Maybe the first step is to move down once to get closer. 

Alternatively, the assistant needs to find the correct direction based on the rules. Since the goal is to reach ""win,"" and the ""win"" is to the far right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Maybe the solution is to push the wall aside by changing the rule. For example, making ""wall is stop"" to remove the STOP property, allowing movement through it. But to do that, I need to edit the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left."" That means ""wall is [something]."" The exact property isn't clear, but if I can move that ""wall"" rule and change its property, maybe to ""nothing"" or ""push,"" then the wall becomes passable. 

So, the plan could be:

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 2 steps left.
2. Push it to a new position, changing its property from ""stop"" to something else.
3. Then navigate through the wall to reach the ""win"" block.

But how to do that step by step. Let's see. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 steps left. If I'm positioned to the right of it, I can move left to get there. But where am I starting? 

This is tricky without knowing the player's exact position. The observations list objects but not the player's location. Maybe the player is assumed to be at a default position, like the bottom-left or somewhere. 

Alternatively, the assistant should try to move towards the ""is"" rules to rewrite them. For example, moving the top ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and change it to ""win."" 

If the assistant tries to move right towards the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right, but there are walls in the way. The wall at 4 steps right might block that path. Unless the walls can be moved by changing their rules. 

Another angle: the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. Maybe combining ""baba is you"" with ""you is win"" to make Baba the win condition. But that requires editing the ""you"" rule. 

Alternatively, create a new rule ""win is you"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you."" 

But all these require navigating to the correct positions, which might need multiple steps. However, the assistant is supposed to output a single action. 

Given the previous failures, maybe the simplest valid action is to move towards the ""is"" rule at the top (1 step up) to start rewriting rules. So, the action would be ""up.""

Let's try to figure out what to do here. So the game is Baba Is You, and I need to manipulate the rules to win. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move and interact as Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. There's also a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 down, which makes things there immovable. The door is at 8 right and 2 down, but I don't know if I can open it yet. There's a ball at 8 right and 3 down, and some walls further down.

The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that. Wait, the ""win"" is a rule, so maybe I can move it or change what's considered a win. Also, there's a ""door"" which might require a key or something, but I don't see a key here. The ball is nearby; maybe I can use it to break walls or interact with the door?

Let me check the rules again. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, which probably means I can pick up that text block to change a rule. The ball is 1 step right and 1 up from the ""is"" rule. If I move right towards the ""is"" rule, I can pick it up. Then, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is win"" to make the ball the win condition instead. Or maybe ""baba is win"" to make myself the win.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can push objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up. If I move up, can I pick it up? Wait, the movement actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. So I need to move to the position of the ""is"" rule and then perhaps push it. But the ""is"" rule's position is 1 step up from where I am now. Let me see my current position. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So I'm at that position. To get to the ""is"" rule which is 1 step up, I need to move up once.

Once I'm next to the ""is"" rule, I can push it. But wait, are there any stop rules blocking? Looking at the map, the walls are at 4 steps right and various positions. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 down, which isn't on my path upwards. So moving up should be possible. Let's plan the steps:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to a position where I can create a new rule. For example, next to the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right to make ""win is you"" or something. Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" next to ""baba"".

But the ""win"" is far to the right. There are walls at 4 steps right, so moving right directly isn't easy. Maybe I can use the ball to break the walls? The ball is at 8 right and 3 down. If I can make the ball a ""stop"" or ""push"" rule, maybe I can move it to destroy walls. Alternatively, if I can make the ball ""win"", then pushing it to the ""win"" position might work.

Wait, there's a ""door"" at 8 right and 2 down. Maybe the ball is needed to open the door. If I can make the door a ""win"" when it's opened, but I don't know how to interact with doors yet. Alternatively, the door might be a pass-through if there's a rule allowing it.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can move through walls unless they have a ""stop"" property. But the walls here are defined by ""wall"" rules. If I can change the ""wall"" rule to something else, maybe I can remove the walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"", then the walls would be stops, but that might not help. Or make ""wall is you"", then I could push the walls? Not sure.

Wait, the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" is a text block. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, I could change what a wall is. For example, move it to say ""wall is nothing"", removing the walls. But how to get there? The ""wall"" rule is 1 step to the left of my current position. My current position is rule `baba` at 1 left and 5 down. So the ""wall"" rule is 1 step left from there, which would be 2 steps left total. But moving left from my current position, there are walls at 4 steps right, but that's to the right. The left side has the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left. So moving left once would get me next to the ""wall"" rule. Then I can pick it up and move it elsewhere.

But the problem is navigating past the other walls. For example, moving left from my position (1 left, 5 down) to reach the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left. But in between, is there any obstacle? The walls are at 4 steps right and various positions, but to the left, it's clear except for the ""wall"" rule itself. So possible to move left once to get to the ""wall"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule like ""baba is push"" to push objects. But I need a way to add that. The ""is"" rule is movable, so if I can get it next to ""baba"" and ""push"", then I can create ""baba is push"".

But this might take multiple steps. Let's try to outline a possible path:

1. Move left to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left, pick it up, and move it to a position where it can be part of a new rule. For example, move it to say ""wall is you"", making the wall controllable. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to create ""baba is win"". To do that:

- Move up to the ""is"" rule (1 step up).
- Pick up ""is"" and move it down to my current position (rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down).
- Place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". But the ""win"" is at 9 steps right, which is far away. So I need to move the ""is"" rule there, but there are walls blocking the path to the right.

Alternatively, use the ball to act as a tool. If I can make the ball ""win"", then push it to the ""win"" location. To do that:

- Move to the ""is"" rule, pick it up.
- Move to the ball's location (8 right, 3 down) and place ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win"". Then the ball becomes the win condition. Then push the ball to the ""win"" spot.

But how to get to the ball's location? There are walls at 4 steps right. Let's see:

My current position is rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down. To reach the ball at 8 right, 3 down, I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to push the wall aside. But to push a wall, I need the ""push"" rule. Since I'm Baba and ""you"", and the default rule is ""baba is you"", but there's no ""baba is push"" yet. So unless I create that rule, I can't push walls.

So perhaps first, create ""baba is push"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""push"". But where is the ""push"" rule? I don't see a ""push"" text block. The available text blocks are ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""ball"". So ""push"" isn't present. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the existing rules. If I can make ""wall is push"", then maybe walls can be pushed. But again, I need an ""is"" rule to create that.

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

Current active rules: Only ""baba is you"".

Available text blocks on the map:

- rule `is` at 1 step up
- ball at 1 right, 1 up
- wall at 4 right, 1 up
- rule `is` at 8 right, 1 up
- rule `win` at 9 right, 1 up
- rule `wall` at 1 left
- wall at 4 right
- wall at 4 right, 1 down
- rule `stop` at 3 right, 2 down
- wall at 4 right, 2 down
- rule `door` at 8 right, 2 down
- wall at 4 right, 3 down
- rule `ball` at 8 right, 3 down
- wall at 4 right, 4 down
- rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down
- rule `is` at 1 left, 5 down
- rule `you` at 1 right, 5 down
- wall at 4 right, 5 down

So the key objects are the ""is"" rule at 1 up, which I can pick up. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""door"" at 8 right, 2 down. The ball at 8 right, 3 down.

Possible strategy:

1. Pick up the ""is"" rule at 1 up and move it to create a new rule. For example, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""baba"" is at 1 left, 5 down, and ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. That's a long distance. Alternatively, create ""win is you"" so that touching the win object makes me win. But how?

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. The ""win"" is a rule, but normally the win condition is to touch the win object. But since the rule is ""baba is you"", touching the win object (which is a separate rule) might not automatically win. So I need to change the win condition.

Maybe create a new rule like ""win is you"", which would make the win object act as a you tile. But how?

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"", making myself the win condition. Then just touching the win rule would make me win. But the win rule is at 9 right, 1 up. How to reach it?

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to be next to me. But ""win"" is a separate object; I can move it if it's not stopped. The ""win"" rule's position is 9 right, 1 up. To move it, I need to push it, but I need the ""push"" rule. Since I don't have ""baba is push"", I can't push it yet.

So maybe first, create ""baba is push"" by using the ""is"" rule. Let's see:

- Move up to the ""is"" rule.
- Pick it up and move it down to my current position (1 left, 5 down).
- Place it next to ""baba"" and ""push"" text blocks. Wait, but where is the ""push"" text block? I don't see any. The available text blocks are ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""ball"". So ""push"" isn't present. Hmm, that's a problem. How can I create a ""push"" rule without a ""push"" text block?

Wait, the text blocks are the ones on the map. The existing ones are the rules like ""baba is you"", ""win is..."", etc., and the objects like ball, wall, door. So to create a new rule, I need to have the subject, the ""is"" rule, and the property. For example, to make ""baba is push"", I need a ""push"" text block. But there isn't one. Unless I can rearrange existing objects.

Wait, maybe the ball can be used as a property. If I can make ""baba is ball"", then I become a ball. Then, if there's a rule like ""ball is win"", touching the win would make me win. But how to set that up.

Alternatively, use the door. If I can make the door the win condition.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's think differently. The ""door"" requires a key, but I don't see a key. However, the ball is nearby. Maybe the ball is the key. If I can make ""ball is key"", then place the ball near the door to open it. But again, I need the ""is"" rule to create that.

Another angle: The ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 2 down. If I can make ""stop is nothing"", then the stop rule becomes immovable. But not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 right, 2 down. If I can move that rule, I could change its property. For example, move it to say ""stop is you"", making stops act as you. But again, I need the ""is"" rule to do that.

So the main challenge is getting to the ""is"" rule to create new rules, but navigating past the walls and stops.

Let's try to plan a path:

1. Move from my current position (1 left, 5 down) to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up.

To move up, I need to go from position (1 left, 5 down) to (1 left, 4 down) by moving up once. Is there any obstacle? Looking at the map, there's a wall at 4 right, 5 down, but that's to the right. So moving up should be clear.

2. Once at the ""is"" rule, pick it up and carry it.

3. Move to a desirable location to create a new rule. For example, next to the ""win"" rule at 9 right, 1 up. But that's a long way. Alternatively, next to the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 5 down.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 5 down. If I can create ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe create ""win is you"", so that touching the win object makes me win.

To do that:

- Move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""win"" and ""you"". So place ""is"" between ""win"" and ""you"" to form ""win is you"".

But the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up, and ""you"" is at 1 right, 5 down. That's a significant distance. How to move the ""is"" rule there?

There are walls at 4 right, which block the path to the right. Unless I can push them. But without a ""push"" rule, I can't.

Alternative idea: Use the ball to break the walls. If I can make the ball a ""stop"" or ""push"" rule, then maybe I can move it to destroy walls. For example, create ""ball is stop"", then the ball becomes a stop, but that might not help. Or ""ball is push"", allowing me to push it.

But to do any of that, I need to create a rule involving the ball. Let's say I move the ""is"" rule to the ball's location (8 right, 3 down) and create ""ball is win"". Then, pushing the ball to the ""win"" location would make it the win condition.

So steps:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 up.
2. Carry it down to the ball's location (8 right, 3 down). But the path is blocked by walls at 4 right. Need to find a way around.

From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving right towards the ball would require passing through 4 right, which has walls. For example:

- Move right 4 times to reach 4 right, 5 down (but there's a wall there).
- Alternatively, move up to 1 left, 4 down, then right to 4 right, 4 down (wall there).
- This seems blocked. Maybe need to go around via different directions.

Alternatively, use the door. The door is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can make the door passable or a win condition.

But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: Since I'm Baba and can move through walls (unless they are stop), but the walls here are defined by the ""wall"" rules. If I can change the ""wall"" rule to something else, like ""wall is nothing"", then the walls become passable.

To do that:

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left (position 1 left, same level as me).
2. Pick it up and move it to a position where it says ""wall is nothing"". For example, place it next to ""wall"" and ""nothing"". But ""nothing"" isn't a text block on the map. Hmm.

Alternatively, create ""wall is you"", making walls act as you. Then I can walk through them. But again, need the ""is"" rule to do that.

So steps:

1. Move left to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left.
2. Pick it up and move it to my current position (1 left, 5 down).
3. Place it next to the existing ""wall"" rule (which is the text block ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"") and change it to ""wall is you"". But how? The existing ""wall"" rule is a text block that says ""wall is ..."", so moving the ""is"" rule next to it and changing the property.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I should focus on the immediate goal: reach the ""win"" rule or change the win condition.

Another idea: The ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move that rule to be next to me, then touching it would win. But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to push it, which requires the ""push"" rule. Since I don't have that, I can't.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba win by default. Like ""baba is win"". To do that:","

So, the goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but since rules can change, I need to check if that's still the case. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba anywhere, but I have to avoid ""stop"" or ""wall"" unless I change those rules. Right now, the closest ""win"" is nine steps to the right at the top. But there's a wall four steps right at the top, and another rule ""is"" there. Maybe I can use that?

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" one step up is nearby. If I move that ""is"" rule to connect to something else, maybe I can change a property. For example, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Let's see. The ""is"" is one step up. If I can move it to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" that could work. But to move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it, right? Since I'm Baba, and normally you can't push walls, but ""is"" isn't a wall unless there's a rule saying so. Wait, the current rules are just ""baba is you,"" so ""is"" is movable.

So, if I move the ""is"" rule that's one step up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" maybe I can create ""baba is win."" But where is Baba located? Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" one step left and five down. So Baba is at that position. The ""is"" rule is one step up from the ball, which is near the top. To get to that ""is"" rule, I need to climb up. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the layout.

From the starting position (Baba is at 1 step left, 5 down), to get to the ""is"" rule one step up, I need to move up. But between me and that ""is"" rule, there's the ball and the wall four steps right up. So maybe I need to move horizontally first. If I move left from my current position (which is 1 step left, 5 down), but there's a wall at 4 steps right, which is not immediately adjacent. Wait, maybe I can move right towards the wall? But the wall is four steps right, and I'm at 1 step left. So moving right would get me closer. Let's see:

My position: rule `baba` is at 1 step left, 5 steps down. So if I move right, I can get to the same column as the wall at 4 steps right? Wait, directions are a bit confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative. For example, if I'm at position (0,0), then moving right increases the x-coordinate, up increases the y-coordinate.

Assuming that, the ""is"" rule is 1 step up from the ball, which is at (1,1) if the ball is 1 step right and up from Baba's starting position. But maybe the exact positions are tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the key is to reach the top where the ""win"" is, but the path is blocked by walls and a ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to turn the ""stop"" into something else. For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing"" or ""stop is you,"" then the stop block wouldn't stop me. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rules to change the properties.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can push objects (as long as they're not stop), maybe I can push the ""is"" rule from the top (1 step up) to connect ""baba"" with ""win."" Let's see. If I can move that ""is"" rule to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would activate, making touching the win object make me win.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position (1 step up) to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" But how? The ""is"" is one step up from the ball, which is near the top. The ""win"" is nine steps to the right at the top. So the ""is"" needs to be moved rightwards and downwards. But I'm at the bottom, five steps down. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule to the right. If I move right towards the wall at 4 steps right, but there's a ""stop"" block three steps right and two down. Wait, maybe there's a way to redirect the ""is"" rule to connect different properties.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 1 step up is near the ""win"" at 9 steps right. If I can move that ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" that would work. But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls and the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""wall is stop"" or something, but that would make walls stop me, which they already are. Hmm.

Another idea: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""you"" rule to somewhere. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down, which is near my current position. If I can move that ""you"" rule to connect to ""win,"" making ""win is you"" or ""you is win,"" then touching win would make me win. But ""you"" is already a property, so changing that might not help.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are objects on the map that can be moved. So maybe I need to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But where is ""baba"" located? There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So to connect that with ""win,"" which is at 9 steps right and 1 step up, I need to place an ""is"" rule between them. But that's a long distance. Maybe I can create a chain of rules?

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""you is win,"" so since I'm you, touching win would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to connect ""you"" and ""win."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down, and ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's a diagonal move. Not sure if possible.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to push the door out of the way, but it's protected by a ""stop"" block. Unless I can change the ""stop"" property.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. If I push the ball into the ""win"" area, but I don't see a rule that makes ball do anything. Unless I can make ""ball is win,"" but that would require moving an ""is"" rule next to ball and win.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me recap:

- I'm Baba, can move anywhere except stop unless I change rules.
- Need to reach the ""win"" object at 9 right, 1 up.
- Obstacles: walls, stop block at 3 right, 2 down.
- Rules on the map: multiple ""is"" rules, ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball.""

Possible actions:

1. Move towards the top to interact with the ""win"" and ""is"" rules.
2. Push the ""is"" rules to create new rules connecting Baba to win.
3. Manipulate existing rules to remove obstacles (like turning stop into nothing).

Let's try to focus on moving the ""is"" rule from the top (1 step up) to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" To do that, I need to move that ""is"" rule right and down. But how?

If I can get to that ""is"" rule, which is 1 step up from the ball, maybe I can move it. To reach it, I need to climb up from my current position. From 1 left, 5 down, moving up would take me to 1 left, 4 down. Then maybe right? But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. Wait, maybe not. Let's think step by step.

Current position: rule `baba` at 1 left, 5 down.

To get to the ""is"" rule at 1 step up (assuming that's 1 step in the up direction from the ball), maybe I need to move up first. So action: up.

After moving up once, I'm at 1 left, 4 down. Then maybe up again to 1 left, 3 down. Continue moving up until reaching the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. But along the way, are there walls blocking?

There's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up. So if I'm moving up from the bottom, I might hit that wall. Unless I can move around it by going left or right first.

Alternatively, maybe I should move right from my current position to get closer to the wall and then navigate around. For example, move right to 2 left, 5 down. Then up to 2 left, 4 down, etc. But I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the best approach is to try moving up towards the ""win"" and see if I can interact with the ""is"" rules there. Alternatively, try to move the ""is"" rule from the top (8 steps right, 1 up) to connect with ""baba"" and ""win.""

Another idea: Since ""baba is you,"" and I can push objects, maybe I can push the ""you"" rule to a different position. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 down, which is adjacent to my current position. If I move right, I can push that ""you"" rule to the right. But would that help? If I make ""you is win,"" then touching win would work. But to do that, I need to place ""is"" between ""you"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, push the ""is"" rule from the top (1 step up) towards the ""you"" rule and ""win."" But how?

I think the key is to create the rule ""baba is win"" by moving an ""is"" between them. To do that, I need to get an ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The closest ""is"" is at 1 step up (near the ball) and another at 8 right, 1 up.

If I can move the 8 right, 1 up ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would work. But the distance is huge. Maybe there's a way to chain the rules. For example, make ""baba is rule `is`"" and then ""rule `is` is win,"" but that requires multiple steps.

Alternatively, maybe push the ""is"" rule from the top (1 step up) to the right, towards the ""win."" If I can move that ""is"" right, then place it between ""baba"" and ""win"" somehow.

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try moving the ""is"" rule from the top (1 step up) to the right. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move right. But how do I get to that ""is"" rule?

From my current position (1 left, 5 down), moving up to 1 left, 4 down, then 1 left, 3 down, etc., until reaching the ""is"" at 1 step up. But between me and that ""is,"" there's the ball and the wall at 4 right, 1 up. So maybe I need to move horizontally first.

If I move right from 1 left, 5 down to 2 left, 5 down, then up to 2 left, 4 down, and so on. But I'm not sure if there are walls blocking that path.

Alternatively, maybe move left from my current position to 0 left, 5 down. Then up to 0 left, 4 down, etc., towards the ""is"" rule. But again, not sure about the layout.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move up towards the top where the ""win"" and other rules are.
2. Push the ""is"" rule from the top (1 step up) to the right towards the ""win.""
3. Place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
4. Then, moving towards the ""win"" would make me win.

To do step 2, I need to be able to push the ""is"" rule. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" and ""is"" isn't a stop unless there's a rule saying so, I should be able to push it.

So the sequence might be:

- Move up from initial position to reach the ""is"" rule.
- Push the ""is"" rule right towards the ""win.""
- Place it between ""baba"" and ""win.""
- Then move to the ""win.""

But how exactly to navigate?

Alternatively, maybe the immediate action is to move up towards the ""is"" rule to interact with it.

Given the previous failed actions, maybe the correct action here is to move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule and then manipulate it.

64,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what action I should take here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other text blocks. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step up"" and a ""ball"" that's 1 step to the right and 1 step up. There's also a ""win"" at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is probably the exit or target.

I need to get to the ""win"" object. The walls are positioned at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up, and further right, so maybe moving right would get me closer. But there are ""stop"" rules and walls blocking some paths. Let me check the positions again.

The ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up"" might be important. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, I could create a new rule like ""win is you"" or something to change the win condition. But first, I need to manipulate the text blocks. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push or move other objects that aren't stopped.

Looking at the ball, it's adjacent to the ""rule `is`"" up above. Maybe if I move the ball to the right, I can push the ""is"" rule. Or perhaps move the ""is"" rule closer to the ""win"" rule. Wait, the ""win"" is at 9 steps right, 1 up. The ""is"" is at 8 steps right, 1 up. So if I can move the ""is"" one step to the right, next to ""win,"" then I can combine them into a new rule like ""win is [something]"". But what's the current setup?

The existing rules include ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right. If I can move that ""is"" rule to the right by one step, placing it next to ""win,"" then I could create a new rule such as ""win is you"" by combining them. But how do I move the ""is"" rule?

Since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't ""stop,"" I need to see if there's a path to the ""is"" rule. The walls are at 4 steps right, so maybe moving right from my current position. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right, 2 steps down. If I go right, I might hit a wall. Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step up from the ball. If I move up to get to the ""is"" rule, then maybe I can push it. Let me check the positions again.

Current active rules: ""baba is you."" Objects include ""rule `is` 1 step up,"" which is probably above the ball. If I move up once, I can be next to the ""is"" rule. Then, if I can push it to the right, placing it next to the ""win,"" that would create a new rule. But how do I move it? Since I'm Baba, and the ""is"" rule is a movable object unless it's under a ""stop"" property. Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is not in the same area as the ""is"" rule up above. So the ""is"" rule should be movable.

So the plan is: move up to get to the ""is"" rule, then move right to place it next to the ""win"" rule. Once that's done, ""win is [something]"" would be active, allowing me to step on the ""win"" object. Alternatively, if I can make the ""win"" rule say ""you,"" then stepping on it would win the level.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is already at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. That's probably not reachable. The ""is"" rule at 5 steps down is part of a rule ""baba is you"" and ""you"" at 5 steps down. Maybe I need to focus on moving the ""is"" above to link with ""win.""

So the steps would be:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right to push the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule.
3. Now, ""win is [what?]"" would be a new rule. If it's ""win is you,"" then stepping on ""win"" would win the game.

But to create ""win is you,"" I need to have the ""you"" rule adjacent. The existing ""you"" is far down, so maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, if I can create a rule like ""win is push"" or something else, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on ""baba"" would make me the win condition. But the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so changing that would require manipulating the existing rule.

Looking back, there's a ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"" and a ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" there. Maybe if I can move those rules up, but they're under a wall at 4 steps right and 5 steps down, so movement might be blocked.

Alternatively, focus on the ""is"" rule above. Let's try to prioritize moving that ""is"" rule to the right next to ""win.""

So, current position of ""is"" is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. ""Win"" is at 9 steps right, 1 step up. Moving the ""is"" one step to the right would place it next to ""win."" To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule and push it right.

To get to the ""is"" rule, I need to move up once from my current position. Then, move right to push the ""is"" rule. So the actions would be: up, then right.

But in the previous observations, when the assistant tried ""up"" and ""left"" actions, sometimes it worked, but sometimes the system flagged invalid actions. Maybe the direction needs to be more precise.

Wait, in the current observation, the ""is"" rule is 1 step up. The ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So the ""is"" rule is above the ball. To reach the ""is"" rule, I need to move up. Once I'm above it, I can move right to push it towards the ""win.""

But how do I know my current position? The observations don't specify where the player (Baba) is located. But based on the objects, maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 5 steps down. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the starting position, and the actions are relative. But without knowing the player's position, it's tricky. However, the system must track the player's position based on previous actions.

Looking at the history, the assistant kept trying left, up, right, but sometimes it defaulted to idle. Maybe the correct path is to move up to get to the ""is"" rule, then right to push it next to ""win.""

So the chosen action would be ""up"" to reach the ""is"" rule, then ""right"" to move it. But the system requires a single action per step. So the first action should be ""up"" to get to the ""is"" rule's location.

In the last few observations, the assistant kept outputting ""up"" but the system kept defaulting to idle. Maybe the action ""up"" isn't valid because the player can't move up from their current position. Alternatively, maybe the player is already at the position of the ""is"" rule.

Wait, the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" — if the player is below that, moving up would get them there. But if the player is already there, moving up again wouldn't do anything. This is unclear without the player's position.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the same position as the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 5 steps down. To reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step up, they need to move up from there. But that's 5 steps up, which isn't possible in one move. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is relative to the ball. The ball is 1 step to the right and 1 step up from something else. This is getting too ambiguous without knowing the map layout.

In any case, the most logical action given the active rules and the presence of the ""is"" rule near the ""win"" is to try to move the ""is"" rule to the right by pushing it. To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule and move in the direction they want to push it. So if the ""is"" rule is to the left of the ""win,"" the player should move right next to the ""is"" rule and then push it right.

Assuming the player can move up to reach the ""is"" rule, the next action would be ""right"" to push it. But the system might require the player to be adjacent first. So the correct sequence would be: move up to get next to the ""is"" rule, then move right to push it.

But since each action is a single step, perhaps the first action should be ""up"" to reach the ""is"" rule's location. Then, the next action would be ""right"" to push it. However, in the current observation, the assistant is being prompted to choose an action based on the current state, so maybe the player is already adjacent to the ""is"" rule and can push it.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" rule is already in a position that can be combined with ""win"" by moving it. If the player can move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, that would create the ""win is"" rule.

Given the previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action here is to move ""up"" to reach the ""is"" rule, then ""right"" to push it. But since the system is only allowing one action per step, the immediate action should be ""up"" to get into position.

But the last few attempts by the assistant resulted in defaults to idle, which suggests that the chosen action wasn't valid. Maybe ""up"" isn't the right move here. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to move in a different direction.

Looking at the objects again, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 1 step right and 1 step up. Perhaps using the ball to push the ""is"" rule. If the ball is adjacent to the ""is"" rule, the player can push both. But the ball is already next to the ""is"" rule. Maybe moving the ball to the right would push the ""is"" rule along.

So the action could be ""right"" to move the ball (and possibly the ""is"" rule) to the next tile. If the player is adjacent to both the ball and the ""is"" rule, moving right would push both. That way, the ""is"" rule moves right next to the ""win.""

Assuming the player is positioned between the ball and the ""is"" rule, moving right would push both the ball and the ""is"" rule one step to the right. This would place the ""is"" rule next to the ""win,"" creating the ""win is"" rule. Then, if the player can add another property, like ""you,"" to make ""win is you,"" that would solve the level.

Therefore, the chosen action should be ""right"" to push the ""is"" rule towards the ""win.""

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can move and interact with other objects.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `is`"" to the left and up, and a ""win"" at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a ""ball"" at 1 step up and to the right. The wall on the right side seems to be a barrier. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were a series of left and up movements, but the assistant kept failing. Maybe the assistant needs to think differently. Let me parse the current observation again.

The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I can move that rule somewhere, I might be able to change other rules. The ""win"" is to the far right, but there are walls blocking the path. There's a ""door"" at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe using the door requires a key or something, but I don't see any key here. 

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""win is flag"" or ""baba is win,"" that might change the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the existing ""is"" rule. Let's see: the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move right towards it, maybe I can pick it up and place it next to ""win"" to make ""win is..."" something.

But wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step left and 1 step up. Where is Baba located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So maybe Baba is at that position. The assistant needs to move Baba (since ""baba is you"") to interact with the text blocks.

The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but the current rule is still ""baba is you,"" so touching the ""win"" would win the level. However, there are walls blocking the direct path to the far right ""win."" The ""door"" at 7 steps right and 2 steps down might be a way through, but it's a stop rule unless there's a way to override it.

Alternatively, maybe manipulating the rules to make the door passable. For example, if I can change ""door is stop"" to something else. But first, I need to find the relevant text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule away or create a new rule that says ""stop is nothing"" or ""door is not stop,"" that might open the door. But to do that, I need to interact with the existing ""is"" rule.

The ""rule `is`"" is at 1 left and 1 up. If I move right towards it, maybe I can pick it up and move it next to ""stop"" to change the ""stop"" rule. Or move it next to ""door"" to create a new rule like ""door is [something].""

But how to reach that ""rule `is`""? Currently, Baba is at 2 left and 5 down. The ""rule `is`"" is 1 left and 1 up. So from Baba's position, moving up once would get to the ""rule `is`"" if possible. But are there any obstacles? Let's check the walls.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 up, but that's on the right side. The path to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 left and 1 up seems clear except for the initial position. So moving up from Baba's current position (2 left, 5 down) to 2 left, 4 down, then 2 left, 3 down, etc., until reaching 1 left and 1 up. Wait, but the ""rule `is`"" is 1 left and 1 up from where? The exact positions might be tricky, but assuming the grid is relative.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant needs to move the ""rule `is`"" block to combine it with ""win"" to make ""win is you"" or something. But first, need to grab the ""is"" rule. 

So, the next action could be moving up to get to the ""rule `is`"" block, then moving it next to ""win"" to create ""win is you,"" making touching the win object win the level. Alternatively, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" to change properties, but since ""baba is you"" is already active, maybe that's not necessary.

But how to move the ""is"" rule. Since the assistant is controlled as Baba (since ""baba is you""), they can move objects that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The ""rule `is`"" is a text block, so it's movable unless there's a rule stating otherwise. Currently, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 2 right, 2 down, but that's for the stop property, not the text blocks. So text blocks like ""is"" should be movable.

Therefore, the plan is: move up to reach the ""rule `is`"" block, then move it to the ""win"" block to create ""win is you"" or another rule that allows winning. 

So the sequence would be: move up, pick up the ""is"" rule, then move right to the ""win"" location and place the ""is"" there, making ""win is you"" or similar. Alternatively, place it next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is win,"" changing the win condition to the ball.

Alternatively, if the goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is at 9 steps right and 1 up, but there are walls (rule `wall` at 1 left and walls at 4 right), perhaps creating a path by removing the wall rules. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, changing it to ""wall is nothing"" would make walls passable.

But to do that, need to find the ""wall"" rule. Looking at the objects: there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 2 step to the left. So moving to that position, combining it with ""is"" to create ""wall is nothing."" 

So steps could be: move left to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left, pick up the ""is"" rule from 1 left and 1 up, then move to the ""wall"" rule and combine them to make ""wall is nothing,"" making walls passable. Then proceed right to the ""win"" object.

But the current position of Baba is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down. To get to the ""rule `wall`"" at 2 step to the left (same x-coordinate?), need to check the positions. Maybe the grid is such that moving left from Baba's position gets to the ""rule `wall`"".

Alternatively, the assistant might need to navigate through the map to reach the necessary text blocks to manipulate the rules.

Another possibility: since the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down (rule `you` 1 step to the right and 5 steps down), combining ""baba"" with ""you"" to reinforce ""baba is you"". But that might not be necessary.

In summary, the key actions are moving to interact with the ""is"" rule and other text blocks to change the rules. The immediate next step is probably moving towards the ""is"" rule to pick it up and then use it to create a new rule that allows progression towards the win condition.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", which means whatever I move, Baba becomes that object. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case or if the rules have been changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. But then there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is near the top right, but there are walls (wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up) and a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. The ""stop"" probably makes those areas immovable.

The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` which is 3 steps to the left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps left and 5 steps down, and ""you"" is 1 step left and 5 steps down. So, moving around here, since I'm Baba and ""you"", maybe I can push things or manipulate rules.

Looking at the ball at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can get to that ball and maybe change a rule to make it ""win"", that could be a way. But how? The ""is"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up, and another ""is"" at 6 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and change it to ""ball is win"".

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. The ""is"" is 2 steps left and 1 step up from Baba's current position. So if I move left from Baba's position, I can reach the ""is"" rule. Once there, I can move it to the ball's location. But I have to check if the path is blocked. The walls are at 2 steps right and 1 step up, so moving left from Baba's position (3 left, 5 down) to reach the ""is"" at 2 left, 1 up. The path would involve moving left once, then up. But between Baba and the ""is"", is there a wall? The wall is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, which is to the right of the ""is"" rule. So moving left from Baba to the ""is"" should be possible.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it to the ball. The ball is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. So from the ""is"" at 2 left, 1 up, I need to move right multiple times and down. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I try to move right past that, would it be blocked? The ""stop"" makes objects or text blocks immovable, so if I'm moving the ""is"" over the ""stop"", maybe I can't. Alternatively, maybe I can move around it. Let's see the path: from 2 left,1 up, moving right to 3, then 4, then 5, 6. But at 3 right and 2 down, there's a ""stop"". So moving down from the ""is"" position (2 left,1 up) to 2 left, 2 down would be okay. Then right to 3 left, 2 down (but that's the ""stop"" rule's position). Wait, the ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So if I'm at 2 left,1 up, moving down to 2 left,2 down would be possible, then right to 3 left (which is same as 3 steps right from origin?), but need to check the map layout.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach. The ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can push the ""door"" out of the way or change its property, but that might not help. The ""win"" is still at 9 steps right and 1 step up, which is blocked by walls. So perhaps the intended solution is to create a new rule making the ball the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and change its property to ""win"". So the steps would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (3 left,5 down) to the ""is"" rule at (2 left,1 up). That would require moving left once, then up four steps. Let's check the path: moving left from 3 left to 2 left is okay. Then up from 5 down to 1 up. The path is clear except for the wall at 2 right and 1 up, but that's to the right of the ""is"" rule, so not blocking.

2. Once at the ""is"" rule, move it to the ball's location (6 right,3 down). The movement would involve moving right 8 steps and down 4 steps. However, there's a ""stop"" at 3 right and 2 down. So moving right from the ""is"" position (2 left,1 up) to 3 left (which is 3 steps right from origin), then down to 2 down. But the ""stop"" is at 3 right and 2 down. So moving down from 2 left,1 up to 2 left,2 down is allowed. Then right to 3 left (3 right), then down to 3 down. But the ""stop"" is at 3 right and 2 down. So when moving to 3 right and 2 down, which is the ""stop"" position, can I move the ""is"" there? Since ""stop"" makes objects immovable, but I'm moving a text block. Maybe I can place the ""is"" next to the ""stop"" but not on it. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So when moving the ""is"" from 2 left,1 up to 3 right and 3 down, the path might be blocked by the ""stop"" at 3 right and 2 down. So perhaps need to find another route.

Alternatively, maybe after getting the ""is"" rule, move it to the ball by going around the ""stop"". For example, move right to 4 steps right, then down, avoiding the ""stop"". But the ball is at 6 right and 3 down. This might be complicated.

Another approach: Maybe instead of moving the ""is"" to the ball, move the ball next to an ""is"" rule and change its property. But the ball is at 6 right,3 down. The closest ""is"" is at 6 right,1 up. If I can move the ball down to the ""is"" rule's position, but the ball is a separate object. Since ""baba is you"", I can push objects if they're not stopped. The ball isn't stopped, so I can move it. Let's see: from the ball's position (6 right,3 down), move it up to 6 right,2 down. Then to 6 right,1 down. Then to 6 right,1 up, which is where the ""is"" rule is at 6 right,1 up. Then place the ""is"" next to the ball and change it to ""win"". But to do that, I need to have the ""is"" rule. So maybe first move the ""is"" from 2 left,1 up to 6 right,1 up (same column), then move the ball down to be next to it.

But moving the ""is"" from 2 left,1 up to 6 right,1 up would require moving right 8 steps. Again, there's a ""stop"" at 3 right and 2 down, but that's not on the same row. So moving right along the top row (1 step up) from 2 left to 6 right should be possible. Once the ""is"" is at 6 right,1 up, then move the ball from 6 right,3 down to 6 right,2 down, then 6 right,1 down, then 6 right,1 up, placing it next to the ""is"". Then change the rule to ""ball is win"".

But this requires multiple moves. The problem is, each step I take, I have to make sure I'm not blocked. Also, the ""stop"" at 3 right,2 down could interfere if I'm moving diagonally or through that area.

Alternatively, maybe the simplest way is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" is at 7 right,1 up. If I can move the ""is"" there and change it to ""baba is win"", but that might not help since the player is already Baba.

Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you"", so the player is controlled as Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but if I can make the ball a win, then touching the ball would win. So the plan is to create ""ball is win"".

To do that, need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and write ""ball is win"". So steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up.
2. Move the ""is"" rule to the ball's position (6 right,3 down).
3. Once adjacent, change the rule to ""ball is win"".

But moving the ""is"" from 2 left,1 up to 6 right,3 down requires moving right 8 and down 4. There's a ""stop"" at 3 right,2 down. So when moving right past 3 right, then down, the path might be blocked when moving down from 3 right to 4 right, etc. Let me visualize:

Starting at 2 left,1 up.

Move right 8 steps: positions would be 3,4,5,6 right.

At each step, check for walls or stops. The wall at 2 right,1 up is to the left of the starting point, so moving right past that is okay. The ""stop"" is at 3 right,2 down. So when moving down from the ""is"" position after reaching 3 right, we have to avoid that.

Alternatively, after getting the ""is"" to 6 right,1 up (same as the other ""is""), then move down to 6 right,3 down where the ball is. But the ball is at 6 right,3 down. So from 6 right,1 up, move down two steps to 6 right,3 down. That's possible, as there's a wall at 6 right,3 down? Let me check the objects. The ball is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. The wall is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and others at 3 right,3 down (wall), 4 right,3 down (wall), etc. So moving down from 6 right,1 up to 6 right,3 down would pass through 6 right,2 down. Is there any obstacle there? The objects listed are:

- rule `door` at 8 steps right and 2 steps down.
- wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps down.
- rule `ball` at 6 steps right and 3 steps down.

So from 6 right,1 up, moving down to 6 right,2 down (no obstacles), then to 6 right,3 down (there's the ball). So placing the ""is"" next to the ball (which is at 6 right,3 down) would require being adjacent. Since the ""is"" is at 6 right,1 up, moving down to 6 right,3 down would be two steps down. Then, once there, the ""is"" is next to the ball? No, because they are in the same column but different rows. To be adjacent, the ""is"" needs to be either to the left, right, up, or down of the ball.

The ball is at 6 right,3 down. The ""is"" would need to be at 5 right,3 down; 7 right,3 down; 6 right,2 down; or 6 right,4 down to be adjacent. So moving the ""is"" from 6 right,1 up down to 6 right,3 down makes them in the same column but not adjacent. Therefore, this approach won't work.

Alternative idea: Move the ""is"" rule next to the ball horizontally. The ball is at 6 right,3 down. To place the ""is"" to its left (5 right,3 down) or right (7 right,3 down). But moving the ""is"" there from its original position (2 left,1 up) would require a lot of steps and avoiding the ""stop"" at 3 right,2 down.

Alternatively, use another ""is"" rule that's already at 6 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" down to be next to the ball. The ""is"" is at 6 right,1 up. Moving it down to 6 right,2 down, then 3 down. But again, the ""stop"" is at 3 right,2 down. So moving right past 3 right would hit the ""stop"". Wait, the ""is"" is at 6 right,1 up. To move down to 6 right,3 down, passing through 6 right,2 down (no obstacles) and 6 right,3 down (ball's position). But the ""is"" would be placed at 6 right,3 down next to the ball. Then change the rule to ""ball is win"".

But the ""is"" rule at 6 right,1 up can be moved down. Let's see:

From 6 right,1 up, move down to 6 right,2 down (clear), then to 6 right,3 down (ball is here). Now, the ""is"" is at 6 right,3 down next to the ball. Then, since ""baba is you"", I can write ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to the ball and changing the property. But how? The action would be to push the ""is"" next to the ball and then change the text. But in the game, you can only move text blocks adjacent to other text blocks. So if I move the ""is"" from 6 right,1 up to 6 right,3 down (next to the ball), then the rule would become ""ball is [whatever the 'is' is paired with]"". Wait, the syntax is ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So if the ""is"" is next to the ball, and I place it there, it would create ""ball IS [property]"". But the property needs to be something. Maybe I can replace the existing ""ball"" rule? There's a ""rule `ball` 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down"", which is the same position as the ball object. So by moving the ""is"" next to the ball, I can create a new rule ""ball IS win"".

But how to do that in the game? Typically, you need to have the ""is"" text block adjacent to both the subject and the property. So maybe move the ""is"" next to the ball and then next to the ""win"" text block. But the ""win"" is at 9 right,1 up, which is far away.

Alternatively, since the ball is already a rule at its position, adding an ""is"" next to it would create ""ball IS [something]"". If I can move the ""is"" next to the ball and type ""win"", but in the game, you can't type; you have to arrange the text blocks. So the existing ""win"" rule is at 9 right,1 up. So perhaps move the ""is"" next to the ball and next to the ""win"" rule, creating ""ball IS win"".

But that would require moving the ""is"" to a position where it's adjacent to both the ball and the win rule. The ball is at 6 right,3 down, and the win is at 9 right,1 up. The shortest path between them is not adjacent. So this might not be feasible.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 8 right,2 down. If I can make the door a win by changing its rule, but that's probably not helpful.

Wait, the current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. The goal is to reach the win condition. If I can make myself a win, then touching myself would win. How? There's a rule `you` at 1 step to the right and 5 steps down. The ""you"" rule is separate. If I can move the ""is"" next to Baba and change it to ""baba is win"", then I would be both you and win. Let's see:

Baba is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step up. So moving to the ""is"" rule, then moving it next to Baba's ""baba"" rule. From the ""is"" at 2 left,1 up, move down to 2 left,5 down (Baba's position). But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 2 steps right and 1 up, and others down the right side. So moving down from 2 left,1 up to 2 left,5 down would pass through steps with walls? Let's check:

From 2 left,1 up:

- Move down 1 step to 2 left,2 up: clear.
- Down to 2 left,3 up: clear.
- Down to 2 left,4 up: clear.
- Down to 2 left,5 up: clear.
- But Baba is at 3 left,5 down. So to reach 2 left,5 down, that's one step left from Baba's position. So possible. Then place the ""is"" next to the ""baba"" rule, creating ""baba is win"". That would make me both you and win, so touching myself (Baba) would win.

But how to move the ""is"" there without being blocked. The path from 2 left,1 up to 2 left,5 down is four steps down. Each step is clear except for the walls on the right side. Since we're moving left, it's safe. So:

1. Move from Baba's position (3 left,5 down) to the ""is"" rule at 2 left,1 up: move left once, up four times.
2. Once at 2 left,1 up, move down four steps to 2 left,5 down (next to Baba's ""baba"" rule).
3. Now, the ""is"" rule is adjacent to ""baba"", so the rule becomes ""baba","

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can manipulate the game by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed. The observation shows several objects and rules on the map.

First, I need to understand the layout. The ""win"" object is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a ""door"" at 6 steps right and 2 steps down. Wall objects are blocking some paths. There's a text block ""is"" nearby. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block to create a new rule.

Looking at the rules, there's ""baba is you"", and another ""is"" block at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can combine the ""ball"" with ""is"" to make ""ball is you"", then I could move the ball to the win condition. Alternatively, changing ""win"" to something else.

But wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. Maybe I need to reach that ""you"" rule to apply it. However, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps down blocking the path. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which might be immovable.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block next to the ""win"" to make ""win is you"". If I can do that, then touching the win object would make me win. But how to move the ""is"" block?

The ""is"" block is 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I move up, maybe I can reach it. But my current position isn't clear. Wait, the user hasn't provided my position, but the previous actions were moving up, left, right. Maybe I'm near the ""is"" block.

Let me check the objects again. The ""rule `is`"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. The ball is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I move right towards the ""is"" block, I can pick it up and move it to the ""win"" location. Then create ""win is you"".

So the steps would be: move right to get to the ""is"" block, then carry it to the ""win"" at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Place the ""is"" there to make ""win is you"". Then, since I'm Baba and ""you"" is already active, touching the win would work.

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can move objects that aren't STOP. The ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which is a different location. So moving the ""is"" block should be possible.

So, first action: move right to reach the ""is"" block. Then, move right again to get to the win's position. Place the ""is"" there. Then, the active rule becomes ""win is you"", so touching win would win the level.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You puzzle step by step. The current observation shows that ""BABA IS YOU"" is the active rule. My goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object, which is usually a door or a specific tile. But first, I need to analyze the map layout and available objects.

Looking at the objects:

1. There's a ""rule `is`"" block at 3 steps left and 1 step up. Maybe this can be moved to create new rules.
2. The ""ball"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. Not sure how that's relevant yet.
3. A ""wall"" is to the right of the ball at 1 step right and 1 step up. Since I'm Baba and ""BABA IS YOU,"" I can push objects that aren't labeled ""STOP"" or similar. But the wall here is a ""wall"" object, which might be stationary unless its rule is changed.
4. The ""win"" object is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. That's the target. But there's a ""door"" at 5 steps right and 2 steps down, which might be a way to reach the win condition.

The active rules are still ""BABA IS YOU,"" so I can manipulate text blocks. The key here might be to change the ""win"" condition or make Baba into something that can pass through walls or doors.

Potential steps:

1. Move the ""rule `is`"" block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN,"" then touching the win object would make me the winner. Alternatively, making ""BALL IS YOU"" so I can push the ball to interact with other objects.

Looking at the current positions:

- The ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move this to adjacent positions, I can create new rules. For instance, moving it right to align with ""BABA"" or ""WIN.""

But how do I move the ""rule `is`""? Since I'm Baba (YOU), I can push objects that aren't STOP. The ""rule `is`"" isn't STOP, so I should be able to move it. Let's check the direction. To move the ""rule `is`"" block to, say, attach it to ""BABA"" to make ""BABA IS [something].""

But in the current setup, the ""rule `is`"" is 3 steps left and 1 step up. My position isn't clear here. Wait, the user's position isn't explicitly listed, but since I'm controlling Baba, my position must be inferred. Let me check the objects again.

Wait, the objects include ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, but that's a rule, not Baba's position. The active rules are ""baba is you,"" so my position must be where the player is located. However, the map description doesn't explicitly state my location. This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to deduce my position based on the objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the player (Baba) is at a specific spot, and the actions are relative to that. Since the previous actions were moving up and right, maybe I'm moving towards the ""rule `is`"" blocks to manipulate them.

Looking at the latest observation, after moving right a few times, the ""rule `is`"" is now at 3 steps left and 1 step up, and the ball is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. My goal is to get to the ""win"" at 6 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. Wait, no—the wall is at 1 step to the right of the ball, which is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. So the wall is at (2 left +1 right) = 0 steps left, 1 step up. So the wall is in the center above me.

To move right towards the win object, I need to push past that wall. But since I'm Baba (YOU), and the wall is a ""wall"" object, unless there's a rule that allows me to move through it, I can't. The default is that walls stop movement. However, if I can change the ""wall"" rule, maybe make ""WALL IS STOP"" or something else, but currently, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left,"" which might be a static rule.

Wait, looking at the objects: there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 4 steps to the left. That means ""WALL IS [something]."" But the observation shows ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left,"" which might mean the text block ""WALL IS"" is located at 4 steps left. So perhaps the actual property isn't specified here. Wait, the format for rules is ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So a ""rule `wall`"" would be the text ""WALL IS"" placed somewhere. If that's the case, then the property for WALL isn't defined here, which might mean the default is still ""WALL IS STOP"" or similar, but need to check.

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left"" means there's a text block saying ""WALL IS"" at that position, but the property part is missing. That would mean the rule is incomplete, but in Baba Is You, incomplete rules don't do anything. So perhaps the wall's property is still defaulting to ""STOP.""

Given that, the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up is a STOP, so I can't push past it. Therefore, I need to find a way to remove the STOP property from the wall or find a way around.

Another approach: If I can make the door the WIN condition. There's a ""door"" at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can change the ""win"" rule to point to the door, then reaching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `win`"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up to be next to the door, so I can write ""DOOR IS WIN.""

But how to get there? The current position of the ""rule `win`"" is far to the right. My character is likely somewhere in the left part of the map, given the previous movements. Let me think about the movement path.

From the latest observation, after moving right multiple times, the ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up, and the ball is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. The player (Baba) must be near these objects. To reach the ""rule `win`"" at 6 steps right and 1 step up, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. Wait, no—the wall is at 1 step right and 1 step up, which is between the ball and the rule `is`. So to get to the rule `win`, I need to push the wall aside. But since the wall is a STOP, I can't push it unless I change its rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall not a STOP. For example, if I can change ""WALL IS STOP"" to ""WALL IS NOTHING,"" then the wall would be passable. To do that, I need to find the existing ""WALL IS"" rule and replace it.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left."" That's likely the text block ""WALL IS"" placed at 4 steps left. If I can move that text block to a different position, maybe next to ""STOP,"" I can create a new rule like ""WALL IS NOTHING.""

But how to do that? I need to be adjacent to the ""rule `wall`"" text block and move it. Since I'm Baba (YOU), I can push objects that aren't STOP. The ""rule `wall`"" block isn't STOP, so I can move it. Let's check the direction. My current position is probably near the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I move right towards the ""rule `wall`"" at 4 steps left, that would require moving left, which might not be helpful. Wait, the positions are a bit confusing. Let's clarify:

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 4 steps to the left. So if I'm at 3 steps left and 1 step up, moving left would take me to 4 steps left, which is where the ""rule `wall`"" is. But can I move it? If I push the ""rule `wall`"" text block to a new position, say next to ""STOP,"" I could create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""rule `wall`"" block to be adjacent to ""STOP,"" then the rule would become ""WALL IS STOP,"" but that's the same as before. Alternatively, if I can move it to be next to ""NOTHING"" or another property. But where is ""NOTHING"" in the map?

Looking at the objects, I don't see a ""rule `nothing`"" mentioned. So maybe that's not an option. Alternatively, if I can erase the ""WALL IS"" rule by moving the text block away, but in Baba Is You, removing a rule by moving its text block away would deactivate it. So if I move the ""rule `wall`"" block away, then the default property of WALL might revert, making it passable.

But how to do that? Let's think. If I'm at 3 steps left and 1 step up, and the ""rule `wall`"" is at 4 steps left, I can move left to reach it. But my direction would need to be left. However, moving left from 3 steps left would take me to 4 steps left, which is where the ""rule `wall`"" is. Then, I can push it further left or in another direction.

Assuming I can move the ""rule `wall`"" block left, perhaps to a position where it's no longer defining the WALL's property. If I move it far enough away, then the WALLs might no longer be STOP. That could allow me to pass through them.

Alternatively, another approach: If I can make myself (Baba) into a WIN object. Since ""BABA IS YOU,"" if I can create a rule like ""BABA IS WIN,"" then touching the WIN object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" block to be next to ""BABA"" and ""WIN.""

Looking at the current ""rule `is`"" position at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move this ""is"" rule to be adjacent to ""BABA"" and ""WIN,"" that would create the desired rule. But where is the ""BABA"" text block? There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps left and 5 steps down, which is the text ""BABA IS"" placed there. Wait, no—the ""rule `baba`"" would be the text ""BABA IS"" located at 4 steps left and 5 steps down. So to create ""BABA IS WIN,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""BABA"" and ""WIN.""

The current ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. If I move it right to align with the ""BABA IS"" text block, then place the ""WIN"" next to it, I can create the rule. But the ""WIN"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step up, which is quite far.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""WIN"" object. Wait, the active rules show ""baba is you,"" and the objects include a ""win"" at 9 steps right and 1 step up. That's the main win condition. The door at 5 steps right and 2 steps down is probably a red herring or a different way to win.

Putting this all together, the most straightforward solution might be to move the ""rule `is`"" block to create ""BABA IS WIN."" To do that, I need to navigate to the ""BABA IS"" text block (rule `baba`) at 4 steps left and 5 steps down and the ""WIN"" object at 9 steps right and 1 step up. However, the distance is quite large, and there are walls in the way.

Another angle: The ball is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can make the ball into a YOU or a WIN, maybe that helps. For example, ""BALL IS YOU"" would let me control the ball, and then push it towards the win. Or ""BALL IS WIN,"" making the ball itself a win condition. But to do that, I need to create those rules.

To make ""BALL IS YOU,"" I would need to move a ""is"" rule next to ""BALL"" and ""YOU."" The ""YOU"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a nearby ""YOU"" rule. Wait, in the current observation, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step right and 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""BALL"" to ""YOU,"" that would make the ball controllable.

The ball is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. That's a significant distance. Moving the ""is"" rule from 3 steps left and 1 step up to intersect with both would require a lot of movement, possibly pushing other objects out of the way.

Given the complexity, perhaps the immediate solution is to focus on manipulating the nearby ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows progression. For example, moving the ""is"" rule to make ""BALL IS PUSH"" or something, but without knowing the exact layout, it's tricky.

Alternatively, since the player has been moving right multiple times and the latest observation shows the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps left and 1 step up, perhaps the next step is to move that ""is"" rule towards the ""WIN"" object. To do that, the player would need to move right, but there's a wall blocking the path. Unless the wall's rule can be changed.

Another possibility: The door at 5 steps right and 2 steps down is a ""door"" which can be opened by pushing it if it's defined as ""DOOR IS PUSH"" or similar. If I can make the door a pushable object, then pushing it might reveal the WIN behind it.

But to change the door's rule, I need to create ""DOOR IS PUSH"" or ""DOOR IS OPEN."" However, the current rules don't mention the door's properties. The existing ""rule `door`"" at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down is likely the text ""DOOR IS"" placed there, meaning the door's property isn't defined, so it might default to being a STOP or something else.

Given all these considerations, the most feasible step at this point might be to move the ""rule `is`"" block to the right to create a new rule that removes the STOP property from the wall, allowing passage. For example, moving the ""rule `wall`"" block away or creating a rule like ""WALL IS NOTHING.""

To do that, the player (Baba) needs to move towards the ""rule `wall`"" at 4 steps left and push it leftward. From the current position at 3 steps left and 1 step up, moving left to 4 steps left would reach the ""rule `wall`"" block. Then, pushing it further left would move it away from its current position, potentially removing the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule.

Once the ""WALL IS"" rule is removed, the walls might no longer be STOP, allowing the player to move through them. Then, the player can proceed right towards the ""win"" object.

So the next action should be to move left towards the ""rule `wall`"" block at 4 steps left and push it further left. However, the player's current position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the latest observation, if the ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step up, and the ball is at 2 steps left and 1 step up, the player is likely between them or nearby.

Assuming the player needs to move left to reach the ""rule `wall`"" block, the action would be ""left."" But wait, in the previous steps, moving right multiple times got the ""rule `is`"" closer. Maybe the player is now positioned to the left of the ""rule `wall`"" block and can push it left.

Alternatively, if the player is at 3 steps left and 1 step up, moving left would take them to 4 steps left, which is where the ""rule `wall`"" is. Then, pushing it further left (another left move) would move it to 5 steps left, removing its position as a ""WALL IS"" rule.

Yes, that makes sense. So the action should be to move left to reach the ""rule `wall`"" block and then push it left, thereby removing the WALL's STOP property.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. To get there, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But wait, the wall is defined by the ""wall"" rule at 1 step to the left. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""wall"" rule or another text block to change its property. 

Alternatively, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to push the door, but the rule says ""rule `door`"" is there. To open the door, maybe I need to make it a ""win"" or something else. Also, there's a ""ball"" at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe moving the ball into a position that helps?

Another thought: the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move that, perhaps I can bypass the wall. But how? Since I'm ""baba,"" I can move text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step up, which might be useful. 

Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you."" If I can move the ""is"" text block, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall,"" I could make ""wall is stop"" or something. But I need to check if ""is"" can be moved. The observation shows there's a rule `is` at 1 step up. Since I'm a movable object (because baba is you), I can probably move that ""is"" block.

So the plan could be: move the ""is"" block to the wall's position to change its property. For instance, moving ""is"" next to the wall rule (which is at 1 step to the left) would create ""wall is [something]"". If I can make ""wall is stop,"" then walls become stop, which might block me, but if I make them ""win,"" then I can step on them. Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition.

But how to do that? Let's see. The current ""is"" block is 1 step up. There's a wall at 1 step to the left. If I move the ""is"" block to the wall's position, then placing it next to the wall rule would make ""wall is [something]"". But the wall's rule is at 1 step to the left, so if I move the ""is"" block to that spot, combining them would form ""wall is [whatever was there before]"". Wait, the original wall rule is ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"". If I move the ""is"" block next to it, maybe I can rewrite the rule. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""is"" block to where the ""win"" rule is. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up blocking the path. So perhaps first, clear the path by changing the wall's property. 

Another approach: The ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door a win, that might be a way through. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is win"". To do that, I need the ""is"" block next to the door's rule. The door's rule is at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The ""is"" block is currently at 1 step up. So maybe move the ""is"" block down to the door's location. 

But how to move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move around. Let's check the position of the ""is"" block. It's 1 step up from the current position. Wait, the observation lists the ""is"" rule 1 step up. So if I'm currently at the starting position, moving up would take me to where the ""is"" block is. Then, I can pick it up and move it elsewhere. 

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can place it next to the door's rule to make ""door is win"". That would make the door a win condition. Then, pushing the door (if possible) or moving to it would allow me to win. 

But how do I interact with the door? If the door is a win, stepping on it would win the level. So the steps could be: 

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move right to the door's location (8 steps right, 2 steps down).
3. Place the ""is"" block next to the door's rule to make ""door is win"".
4. Then, move to the door and step on it to win.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ball involved. The ball is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can make the ball a win, that might help. But the ball's rule is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. So moving the ""is"" block there to create ""ball is win"". 

But the ""is"" block is currently 1 step up. So moving up, then right multiple times. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: 

Current position: Assume Baba is at the starting point, perhaps where the first ""is"" rule was originally. To get to the door's ""is"" block (8 steps right, 2 steps down), I need to move right 8 times and down 2. But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 4 steps right and 1 step up is a wall. So moving right directly might be blocked. 

Hmm, maybe another strategy. Let's see the active rules again. The main rule is ""baba is you"". So I can move any objects that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So I can't move anything there. 

Looking at the objects, the ""ball"" is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I move the ball somehow, but I need a rule to allow that. Alternatively, maybe use the ball to push other objects. 

Wait, the ""door"" is a rule at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to it, then the door becomes the win condition. So the steps would be:

1. Move up to pick up the ""is"" block (it's 1 step up from current position).
2. Move right 7 times and down 2 times to reach the door's location. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 steps right and 1 step up is a wall. So moving right directly might not work. Maybe need to find a path around. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" rule's location. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So perhaps clear that wall first by changing its property. 

To change the wall's property, move the ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left. So:

1. Move left to the ""wall"" rule's position.
2. Move the ""is"" block next to it to create a new rule. For example, ""wall is stop"" or ""wall is you"". But if I make it ""wall is stop"", then walls become stop, which I can't pass. Not helpful. If I make ""wall is you"", then walls are you, so I can walk through them. But ""baba is you"" is already active. 

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition. So move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" somewhere. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So:

1. Move left to the ""baba"" rule's position.
2. Place the ""is"" block next to it to make ""baba is win"". Then, I would be the win condition, so stepping anywhere would win. But I need to get to the ""baba"" rule. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. From the current position, moving left once reaches there. Then, place the ""is"" block next to it. 

So steps:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move left to the ""baba"" rule's position (1 step left).
3. Place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is win"".
4. Then, any move would win, but I need to exit the current position. Maybe move right or down.

But how do I place the ""is"" block next to ""baba""? The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So if I'm at that position, placing the ""is"" block either to the left or right of it would create the new rule. 

Once ""baba is win"" is active, the goal is achieved just by existing. But I need to make sure that this rule is created. 

Alternatively, maybe creating ""you is win"" would also work, but the current ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the ""win"" object or change the win condition.
- Current rules: baba is you.
- Key objects: ""is"" block at 1 step up, ""win"" at 9 right,1 up, ""door"" at 8 right,2 down, ""ball"" at 1 right,1 up.

Possible solutions:

1. Change the win condition to self (baba is win).
2. Change the door to win.
3. Remove the wall blocking the path to win.

Let's try solution 1: Make baba the win.

To do that, need to move the ""is"" block next to the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. 

Current position: Assume I'm at the starting point, perhaps where the first ""is"" was. Let's check the initial setup.

In the first observation, the ""is"" rule was 1 step up. So moving up takes me to that ""is"" block. Then, moving left from there gets to the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down. 

So steps:

- Move up to grab the ""is"" block.
- Move left once to the ""baba"" rule's position (which is 1 step left from where the ""is"" block was).
- Then, need to move down 5 steps to reach the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So from the ""is"" block's position (1 step up), moving down 5 steps and left 1 step would reach there. 

But moving down 5 steps would take me past several walls. For example, at 2 steps down there's a ""stop"" rule. Since I'm ""baba is you"", I can move through walls unless they are ""stop"". The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. But if I'm moving down from the ""is"" block's position (1 step up), my path would be straight down. However, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but that's above me. 

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. The coordinates are relative. Let's parse the objects again:

The ""is"" rule is 1 step up from the current position. So if I'm at position (0,0), the ""is"" is at (0,1). The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down, which would be (-1, -5). To get there from (0,1), I need to move left 1 and down 5. 

But along the way, are there any stops? The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down from the current position. So (3,-2). Moving left and down from (0,1) wouldn't pass through that area. 

So possible path:

1. Move up to (0,1) to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move left to (-1,1).
3. Move down 5 steps to (-1,-5), reaching the ""baba"" rule.
4. Place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"".
5. Now, since I'm baba and the win condition is myself, I can just move anywhere to win.

But how to place the ""is"" block next to ""baba""? The ""baba"" rule is at (-1,-5). Placing the ""is"" block either to the left or right of it would create the new rule. 

So from (-1,-5), if I move right to (0,-5) and place the ""is"" block there, combining with ""baba"" at (-1,-5) would create ""baba is win"". 

So steps after reaching (-1,-5):

- Move right once to (0,-5) and place the ""is"" block. Now the rule ""baba is win"" is active.
- Then, any move would win. So I can move right, left, etc.

This seems feasible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

From the initial position, moving up to get the ""is"" block. Then, moving left and down directly to the ""baba"" rule's location. 

But how many steps is that? Left 1, down 5. So total 6 steps. 

Yes, possible. 

Once ""baba is win"" is created, the level is won. 

Therefore, the action plan is:

1. Move up to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move left once.
3. Move down 5 times.
4. Move right once to place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"".
5. Then, any move wins.

But in the current observation, after moving up, the ""is"" block is picked up, and then need to navigate to the ""baba"" rule's position. 

However, in the current observation provided, after several failed actions, the last valid action was ""right"". The current observation shows that after moving right, the ""is"" block's position has changed. 

Wait, the latest observation before the current one had the ""is"" block at 2 step to the left and 1 step up, ball at 1 step left and 1 step up, etc. 

In the current observation, the ""is"" block is at 3 step to the left and 1 step up, ball at 2 step left and 1 step up. So perhaps the agent moved left and down previously. 

But regardless, the key is to get the ""is"" block next to either the ""baba"" rule or the ""door"" rule to change the win condition. 

Considering all this, the best immediate action would be to move towards the ""is"" block to pick it up and then proceed to the ""baba"" rule's location. 

But in the current observation, the ""is"" block is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. So from the agent's current position, moving left 3 times and up 1 time would reach the ""is"" block. Wait, no—the ""is"" block's position is relative. If the agent is at the default starting point (presumably where the original ""is"" was), but in the current observation, the ""is"" block is 3 steps to the left and 1 step up. So to reach it, the agent needs to move left 3 and up 1. 

But perhaps the agent is already near the ""is"" block. Alternatively, maybe the agent should first move to the ""is"" block to grab it, then proceed. 

Given the complexity, the most straightforward valid action at this point, considering previous failures, might be to move left to reach the ""is"" block or to adjust position to place it correctly. 

Alternatively, since the ""is"" block is already relatively close (3 steps left and 1 up), moving left once would get closer. 

But the exact sequence is tricky. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best action is to move left to get closer to the ""is"" block or to reposition to place it next to ""baba"".

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current state. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, Baba can be moved. The goal is typically to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if the rules have been altered.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. So the original win condition is still there, right? But sometimes in Baba Is You, you can change the win condition. Let me check if any other rules affect that. The only other rules are ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" and ""ball."" The ""win"" rule is still intact, so the goal is probably to reach that ""win"" object.

But how to get there? There are walls blocking the path. The walls are at positions 1 step to the left, 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, etc. There's also a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. ""Stop"" makes objects immovable, so I can't push past them. There's a door at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to open the door or become the door?

Additionally, there's a ball at 1 step up. The ball might be useful if I can turn it into something else. For example, if I can make the ball ""you"" or ""win,"" that might help. But right now, the rules are ""baba is you"" and other wall and stop rules.

The player (Baba) is currently at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down, according to the previous observation. Wait, no—the current observation shows rule `you` at 5 steps down, but Baba's position isn't explicitly listed. Let me check again. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so Baba's position must be where the ""you"" rule is applied. Wait, no—the ""you"" rule is separate. Let me parse the objects again.

Objects:
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- ball 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left
- wall 3 steps to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- rule `ball` 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
- rule `you` 5 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down, and there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down, and ""rule `you`"" at 5 steps down. So putting this together, the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 5 steps down is linking ""baba"" (at 2 steps left and 5 steps down) to ""you"" via the ""is"" rule next to it. So the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, which means Baba is the ""you"" entity because ""baba is you"" is active. So Baba's position is where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down.

So my current position is 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. The goal is the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right and 1 step up. The path is blocked by walls and a stop. Let's visualize the map:

Starting from my position (Baba at 2 left, 5 down):

Looking up: there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 left, 1 up, then a ball at 1 up, then a wall at 3 right, 1 up. The ""win"" is further right beyond that.

Looking to the right: from my position, moving right would go towards the walls at 3 right and various steps down. The ""door"" is at 7 right, 2 down, which might be unlocked if I can change its rule.

Looking left: there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left, so I can't go past that because it's a wall.

Looking down: there's a wall at 3 right, 5 down, so going down isn't helpful.

So the main path is up, but blocked by walls and a stop. Let's see the path upwards:

From my position (2 left, 5 down):

Up one step: 2 left, 4 down. Is there anything there? Looking at the objects, the walls are at 3 right, 1 up; 3 right, 1 up down; etc. Not sure. Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 right, 2 down. So if I move up, maybe I can reach the ""win"" area.

Wait, let's map out the coordinates more clearly. Let's assume Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- ""rule `is`"" 1 step to the left and 1 up would be (-1, 1)
- ball 1 step up: (0,1)
- wall 3 right, 1 up: (3,1)
- rule `is` 7 right, 1 up: (7,1)
- rule `win` 8 right,1 up: (8,1)
- rule `wall` 2 left: (-2,0)
- wall 3 right: (3,0)
- wall 3 right,1 down: (3,-1)
- rule `stop` 2 right,2 down: (2,-2)
- wall 3 right,2 down: (3,-2)
- rule `door` 7 right,2 down: (7,-2)
- etc.

Baba's position: according to the ""rule `baba`"" at 2 left and 5 down, which would be (-2, -5). And the ""you"" rule is at 5 down, so that's (-2,-5) as well, since ""baba is you"" makes Baba the you entity.

So the goal is to reach (8,1) which is the ""win"" rule. The path from (-2,-5) to (8,1) is blocked by walls and a stop.

Possible strategies:

1. Move around the walls by manipulating rules. For example, if I can turn a wall into a path by changing its rule, or make myself able to pass through walls.

2. Use the ball to interact with doors or other objects. The ball is at (0,1). If I can make the ball ""win,"" then perhaps pushing it to the win rule would work. Or maybe make the door ""win.""

3. Change the ""stop"" rule to allow movement through it.

But to do any of this, I need to move the text blocks. The only movable objects are those not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Since Baba is ""you,"" I can move text blocks that are not stopped.

Looking at the current rules, the ""stop"" is at (2,-2). So any text block there is immovable. The other rules are at various positions. For example, the ""win"" rule is at (8,1). If I can move that ""win"" rule closer, or change it to something else.

Alternatively, create a new rule that allows Baba to win by being somewhere else. For example, ""flag is win"" if there's a flag, but there's no flag here. Or ""baba is win,"" but that would require moving the ""win"" text next to ""baba.""

But how to move the text blocks? Let's see the positions of the rules:

- ""rule `is`"" at (-1,1)
- ""rule `win`"" at (8,1)
- ""rule `wall`"" at (-2,0)
- ""rule `stop`"" at (2,-2)
- ""rule `door`"" at (7,-2)
- ""rule `ball`"" at (7,-3) [Wait, earlier observation had rule `ball` at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If Baba is at (-2,-5), then 7 right and 3 down would be (7,-3).]

So the ""ball"" rule is at (7,-3), and the actual ball object is at (0,1). Wait, maybe the ball object is separate from the rule. The ball object is at (0,1), and the ""rule `ball`"" is at (7,-3). So to interact with the ball, I might need to move the ""ball"" rule somewhere.

If I can make the ball ""you"" or ""win,"" that might help. For example, if I can move the ""ball"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, making ""ball is win,"" then pushing the ball into the win area would trigger the win condition.

But to do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule from (7,-3) to somewhere near the ""win"" rule at (8,1). However, moving it would require navigating past obstacles.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" I can move text blocks that are not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at (2,-2), so any text block there is immovable. Other rules can be moved.

For example, the ""is"" rule at (-1,1) could be moved. If I move that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule. But not sure.

Alternatively, use the ball to push other objects. But the ball is at (0,1), and I'm at (-2,-5). That's quite far. Maybe I need to move horizontally first.

Wait, from my current position (-2,-5), moving right would take me towards (3,0), which is a wall. So that's blocked. Moving left takes me to (-3,-5), but there's a ""rule `wall`"" at (-2,0), which is above me, not left.

Alternatively, move up. Let's see: moving up from (-2,-5) would go to (-2,-4), (-2,-3), etc. Is there a path up?

At (-2,-3): Are there any objects? Looking at the map, the walls are at (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (2,-2), (3,-2), (7,-2), etc. Not sure about (-2,-3). If there's a wall there, I can't move. Otherwise, I can proceed.

But how does moving up help? The ""win"" is at (8,1), which is far to the right and up. Maybe I need to find a way to reach the upper right area.

Another idea: The ""door"" at (7,-2). If I can make the door ""win,"" then stepping into it would win the level. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is win."" But how?

To create a new rule, I need to have an ""is"" rule adjacent to the subject and property. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule from (-1,1) to be next to the ""door"" at (7,-2) and the ""win"" rule at (8,1), maybe I can form ""door is win.""

But moving the ""is"" rule from (-1,1) to (7,-2) would require a path. Let's see the path from (-1,1) to (7,-2):

From (-1,1), moving right to (0,1), then right to (1,1), etc., but there's a wall at (3,1). So that's blocked. Alternatively, move down from (-1,1) to (-1,0), (-1,-1), etc. But there are walls at (3,0), (3,-1), (2,-2), etc. It's unclear if there's a clear path.

Alternatively, use the ball to push objects. But the ball is at (0,1), and I'm at (-2,-5). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate the existing rules to change the win condition. The current ""win"" rule is at (8,1). If I can move that rule closer, or change it to something else.

For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would win just by being Baba. To do that, I need to have the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" But ""baba"" is at (-2,-5), and the ""win"" rule is at (8,1). That's too far apart.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""flag is win"" if there's a flag, but there isn't one here.

Another approach: Turn a wall into a path. For example, if ""wall is stop,"" then walls would be stop, but that might not help. Or ""stop is push,"" but not sure.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at (2,-2). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then maybe I can pass through the area it was protecting. But the ""stop"" rule itself is stopped, so I can't move it. The text block for ""stop"" is at (2,-2), and since it's a stop, it's immovable.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me think again.

The key is to find a way to reach the ""win"" rule or change the win condition. Since direct path is blocked, maybe using the ball to create a new rule.

The ball is at (0,1). If I can move the ""ball"" rule from (7,-3) to be near the ""win"" rule at (8,1), then create ""ball is win."" That way, pushing the ball into the win area would make it win.

But how to move the ""ball"" rule? To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The ""ball"" rule is at (7,-3). My current position is (-2,-5). That's quite far. I need to navigate to (7,-3) to move the ""ball"" rule.

The path from (-2,-5) to (7,-3):

First, move right towards (3,0), but there's a wall there. So maybe move up to avoid the wall.

From (-2,-5), move up to (-2,-4), (-2,-3), (-2,-2). At (-2,-2), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (3,-2), but not at (-2,-2). So I can move up to (-2,-2).

From (-2,-2), move right. The next position is (-1,-2). Is there a wall there? Not that I see. Move right to (0,-2).

From (0,-2), move right to (1,-2), (2,-2). But at (2,-2) there's a ""rule `stop`,"" which is immovable. So I can't go past that. So this path is blocked.

Alternative path: From (-2,-5), move up to (-2,-4), (-2,-3), (-2,-2), then left? But moving left from (-2,-2) to (-3,-2). Is there a wall there? Not that I see. So maybe move left to (-3,-2), (-4,-2), etc., but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, move up to (-2,-1), (-2,0). At (-2,0), there's a ""rule `wall`"" which is a wall, so I can't go through it.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (-1,1). If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule at (7,-3), then I could create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to (6,-3) and then placing it next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is [something].""

But to move the ""is"" rule from (-1,1) to (6,-3), I need a path. Let's see:

From (-1,1), move down to (-1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,-2), (-1,-3), (-1,-4), (-1,-5). Then move right to (0,-5), but my current position is (-2,-5). Wait, this might not be the best path.

Alternatively, from (-1,1), move right to (0,1), which is the ball object. Then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (3,1). So stuck again.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can become the win by creating a rule ""baba is win."" But how?

To create ""baba is win,"" I need to have the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" But ""baba"" is at (-2,-5) and ""win"" is at (8,1). They're too far apart. Unless I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba.""

To move the ""win"" rule at (8,1), I need to be adjacent to it and move it. But the ""win"" rule is a text block, and I can move it if it's not stopped. Since there's no ""stop"" rule on the ""win"" text, I can move it.

So, possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""win"" rule at (8,1).
2. Once adjacent, move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" at (-2,-5).

But the distance between (8,1) and (-2,-5) is quite large. How to navigate there?

Alternatively, use the ball to act as a bridge. For example, if I can push the ball into certain positions to create new rules.

Another idea: The ""door"" at (7,-2). If I can make the door ""open"" or remove its ""stop"" property, then stepping through it would win. To do that, I might need to change the door's rule.

Let's see. The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do applies to me. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a ""door"" at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. There's a ""stop"" wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. Also, the ""you"" rule is at 5 steps down, which is the same position as the ""you"" text block. So maybe the ""you"" is there to indicate that whatever is under it becomes the player?

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. The ball is to the right, but there are walls blocking the path. The ""win"" is up at the top, but the path might be blocked. The ""door"" might require a key or something, but there's no key mentioned. The ball could be involved here. Maybe if I move the ball to the door? But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules. There are ""is"" rules scattered around. For example, at 5 steps down, there's ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down"" and ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down."" If I can move the ""you"" rule to another object, like Baba, then maybe I can make Baba the win. Or change ""win"" to something else.

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" So I'm Baba. If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win object. But how to do that? I need to find the ""is"" rule and move it next to Baba and ""win."" Let's see the positions.

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up, 1 step left. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. So if I move the ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would be created. But to move the ""is"" rule, I need to check if it's movable. The ""is"" rule itself doesn't have any properties like STOP, so I can move it. 

Baba is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down according to the previous observation. Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So Baba's position is there. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. 

So if I can move the ""is"" rule from (left 1, up 1) to be next to Baba (left 2, down 5) and the ""win"" (right 8, up 1), that might not be adjacent. Maybe there's another way. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to where the ""you"" rule is, which is at 5 steps down. If I make ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between Baba and Win, but the positions are too far apart. 

Alternatively, look at the ""ball."" If I can move the ball to the door, which is a STOP, maybe that block the path? Not sure. Or maybe the door requires the ball to open it, but how?

Another angle: The ""stop"" wall at 2 right and 2 down. If I can turn that into something else, like making it ""stop is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""noun"" for nothing. Alternatively, create a rule like ""stop is you,"" but that might block me.

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you."" So I'm movable. The problem is getting past the walls. Let me check the path to the win. Up to the top, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 up, then rule 'is' at 7 right and 1 up. Maybe moving the 'is' rule could change something. For example, if I move the 'is' rule near the wall, maybe change the wall's property. But the wall is defined by ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left.""

Alternatively, use the ball. If I push the ball towards the door, maybe the door becomes passable? Not sure. The door is a STOP normally. If I can make the door into a WIN by moving an 'is' rule next to it and 'win.'

Wait, the current 'win' is at 8 right, 1 up. The door is at 7 right, 2 down. If I can create a rule ""door is win,"" then the door would be the win. To do that, I need to move an 'is' rule next to door and win. But the 'is' rules are scattered. There's an 'is' at 1 left, 1 up, and another at 7 right, 1 up, and another at 5 steps down.

Alternatively, move the 'is' from 7 right, 1 up (which is next to the existing 'win' rule) to be next to the door and win. But the door is 7 right, 2 down, and win is 8 right, 1 up. Not adjacent. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the 'you' rule. The 'you' is at 5 steps down. If I can make Baba the 'you' by moving the 'you' rule next to Baba, but that's already the case since ""baba is you"" is active. 

Wait, the 'you' rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So if I move that 'you' rule next to Baba's position (2 left, 5 down), then it would say ""baba is you."" But that's already the case. 

Alternatively, create a new 'you' rule for another object. For example, make the ball 'you' so I can push it. But how? To do that, I need to create ""ball is you."" To do that, I need to move an 'is' rule next to ball and you. The existing 'you' is at 5 steps down. The ball is at 1 left, 1 up. So if I can move the 'is' rule from 1 left, 1 up to be between ball and you, that would create ""ball is you."" Then I could push the ball and interact with the door or win.

But how to move the 'is' rule? The 'is' is at 1 left, 1 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down. So to get to the 'is' rule at 1 left, 1 up, I need to move up and left. Let's see:

From Baba's position (2 left, 5 down), moving up once would be 2 left, 4 down. Then left again to 3 left, 4 down. Then up to 3 left, 3 down. Not sure. Maybe there's a better path. Alternatively, check if the 'is' rule is adjacent to any movable objects. The 'is' rule is at 1 left, 1 up. Are there any walls or stops there? The wall is at 2 step left, so maybe the 'is' is near a wall. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push the 'is' rule. If the ball is at 1 left, 1 up, and I can push it towards the 'is' rule. But the ball's position is 1 left and 1 up, same as the 'is' rule? Wait, no. In the current observation, the ball is at 1 step up, and the 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. So the ball is to the right of the 'is' rule. So if I can move the 'is' rule to the right, towards the ball and the 'you' rule.

But to move the 'is' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. My position is 2 left, 5 down. So I need to navigate up and left to reach the 'is' rule. Let's see: move up from 5 down to 4 down, then again to 3 down, then to 2 down, then 1 down, then up to 0, but the 'is' is at 1 left, 1 up. So maybe:

1. Move up from 5 down to 4 down.
2. Move up again to 3 down.
3. Move up to 2 down.
4. Move up to 1 down.
5. Move up to 0, but that's not right. Wait, coordinates might be relative. Maybe the 'is' is 1 step left and 1 step up from Baba's current position. So from Baba at (2L,5D), moving left once to 3L,5D, then up to 3L,4D, then left to 4L,4D, etc. This is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, focus on the immediate goal. The 'win' is at 8 right, 1 up, but there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. If I can change the wall to something else, like 'nothing', then I could pass through. To do that, I need to create a rule like 'wall is nothing'. But to create that, I need to move an 'is' rule next to 'wall' and 'nothing'. But 'nothing' isn't an object here. 

Alternatively, use the existing 'wall' rule at 2 step left. The rule 'wall' is at 2 left. If I can move that 'wall' rule somewhere else, maybe. But 'wall' is a property, not a movable object unless it's part of a text block. Wait, the objects on the map include rule `wall` 1 step to the left. So that's a text block saying ""wall"" which defines an area as wall. If I can move that text block, then the wall property would move. 

But to move the 'wall' text block, it's either STOP or can be moved. The 'wall' rule at 2 left doesn't have any properties like STOP, so it's movable. So if I can move that 'wall' text block away, then the area it's covering would no longer be a wall. 

For example, the 'wall' text block is at 2 left. If I move it to the right, say to where the 'stop' is at 2 right and 2 down, then the original wall area (3 right, 1 up) would no longer be a wall. But how to move the 'wall' text block. 

To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. My position is 2 left,5 down. The 'wall' rule is at 2 left. So I need to move left to get to it. From 2 left,5 down, moving left once to 3 left,5 down. Then maybe up or down? The 'wall' rule is at 2 left, same as my position? Wait, in the current observation, the 'rule `wall`' is at 2 step to the left. So my position is rule `baba` at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. The 'wall' rule is at 2 step to the left. So to get to it, I need to move left once from my current position. 

So action sequence:

1. Move left from (3L,5D) to (4L,5D).
2. Then move left again to (5L,5D), but wait, the 'wall' rule is at 2 step to the left. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinates. 

Alternatively, the 'wall' rule is 2 steps to the left from the starting point. If my current position is 2 steps left and 5 down, then moving left would take me further left. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Perhaps the better approach is to focus on creating a new rule that makes Baba the win. Since ""baba is you"" is active, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win area would make me win. To do that, I need to move an 'is' rule next to Baba and Win. 

The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. Baba is at 2 step left and 5 step down. The Win is at 8 step right and 1 step up. These positions are not adjacent. So maybe I can't directly place the 'is' between them. 

Alternatively, use the ball to create a path. If I can push the ball to block a stop wall, but not sure. 

Another idea: The 'you' rule is at 5 steps down. If I can move that 'you' rule to the ball, making ""ball is you"", then I could push the ball towards the door. Then, if the door is a win, maybe stepping on it would work. But the door is a STOP normally. 

To make the door a win, I need to create ""door is win"". To do that, move an 'is' rule next to door and win. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, win is at 8 right and 1 up. Not adjacent. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the 'is' rule from 7 right, 1 up (next to the existing 'win' rule) to be next to the door and win. But how? The 'is' is at 7 right, 1 up. The door is at 7 right, 2 down. So moving the 'is' down once would place it at 7 right, 2 down, next to the door. Then create ""door is win"". 

But to move the 'is' from 7 right, 1 up to 7 right, 2 down, I need to be adjacent to it and move it down. My current position is 2 left,5 down. How to get there? It might take several moves. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push the 'is' rule. The ball is at 1 left,1 up. If I can move the ball towards the 'is' rule at 7 right,1 up, but the ball is on the left side. This seems impossible. 

Maybe the key is to realize that the 'win' is at 8 right,1 up, and there's a rule 'is' at 7 right,1 up. So ""win"" is one step right of the 'is' rule. If I can move the 'is' rule one step right, it would be next to 'win', making ""win is something"". But what? If I move it to be next to 'win' and another object, like 'you', then ""win is you"". 

But the 'you' is at 5 steps down. Not adjacent. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to be between 'win' and 'baba'. But 'baba' is at 2 left,5 down. Not adjacent. 

This is really tricky. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look for the simplest solution. The most straightforward way to win is to reach the 'win' object. To do that, I need to path through the walls. The path up to the 'win' is blocked by a wall at 3 right,1 up. If I can remove that wall, perhaps by moving the 'wall' text block. 

The 'wall' text block is at 2 left. If I can move it to another position, the area it covers (3 right,1 up) would no longer be a wall. So moving the 'wall' rule from 2 left to, say, 3 right,1 up. But how? 

To move the 'wall' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. My position is 2 left,5 down. The 'wall' rule is at 2 left. So moving left once gets me to 3 left,5 down. Then maybe down or up? Not sure. 

Alternatively, use the ball to push the 'wall' rule. But the ball is at 1 left,1 up, which is far from the 'wall' rule at 2 left. 

Another approach: Create a rule that makes STOP nothing. For example, ""stop is nothing"". Then the stop wall wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move an 'is' rule next to 'stop' and 'nothing'. But 'nothing' isn't an object here. 

Alternatively, make ""stop is you"", so when I hit the stop, I become you, but that doesn't help. 

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you"". If I can make ""stop is you"", then when I hit a stop, I become you, which might not be blocked. But I'm already you. 

Hmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win' to create ""baba is win"". Let's see:

The 'is' rule is at 1 left,1 up. Baba is at 2 left,5 down. The 'win' is at 8 right,1 up. These are not adjacent. So I need to move the 'is' rule to a position where it's between Baba and Win. 

But how? The 'is' rule is at 1 left,1 up. To get it next to Baba (2 left,5 down), I need to move it down and right. But that's a long way. 

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 8 right,1 up. If I can move it left to be next to the 'is' rule, then create ""win is something"". But the 'win' rule is a text block, so it's movable. 

To move the 'win' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. My position is 2 left,5 down. The 'win' is at 8 right,1 up. Not adjacent. 

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to think outside the box. The 'you' rule is at 5 steps down. If I can make ""you is win"", then touching the win would make me win. To do that, move the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'win'. The 'you' is at 1 left,5 down. The 'win' is at 8 right,1 up. Not adjacent.

There's a rule `is` 1 step up. Maybe I can move that rule somewhere else to change the definitions. The ""win"" is currently a rule, but it's defined as `win` at 9 steps to the right. Wait, no—the active rules show ""baba is you,"" but other rules are present. There's a `door` at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, and a `ball` at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe those can be used.

If I can push the `ball` to the `door`, maybe that opens a path? Or perhaps change the `win` rule to something else. Let me check the positions again. The `win` is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, and another at 3 steps right. The `stop` rule is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a wall that can't be moved through.

The `is` rule is 1 step up. If I can move that `is` rule to combine with another property, like making ""baba"" equal to ""win,"" that would make me the win condition. But how? The current `is` rule is in the way. Maybe I need to move it left or right to attach it to another text block.

Looking at the bottom part, there's another `is` rule at 5 steps down, next to `you`. The `you` rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" and then ""baba is win,"" maybe that would work. But right now, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" The other rules are separate.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the `ball` to the `door` and use that to open a path. The `door` is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can get the ball there, perhaps it becomes passable. But how to move the ball? I need to be adjacent to it. The ball is 1 step up from the current `is` rule. If I move right or left towards the ball, maybe I can push it.

Wait, my current position isn't clear from the observation, but the active rules and objects are listed. Let me assume I'm at Baba's position, which is defined by the `baba` rule at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So I'm there. To move towards the ball, which is 1 step up and 1 step to the left of the `is` rule. Maybe I need to go left first to reach the ball.

But the path might be blocked. Let's see. From my position, if I move left, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down. Wait, no—the walls are at specific positions. Let me map this out mentally.

Current position (Baba): 2 steps left and 5 steps down.

Ball: 1 step up (from Baba's position?), but looking at the objects, the ball is 1 step up from the `is` rule which is 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Maybe the ball is in a different location. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to focus on the available text blocks.

The key is to interact with the `is` rules to create new rules. The `is` rule at 1 step to the left and 1 step up can be moved. If I can grab that `is` rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition. But how to do that?

To move the `is` rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The `is` is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from where I am (Baba at 2 left, 5 down). So the `is` is at 3 left, 4 down? Not sure. Maybe the directions are relative. Alternatively, the `is` is 1 step up from the ball, which is 1 step up from the wall at 3 right, 1 up.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let's try to think step by step.

1. Goal: Reach the `win` at 8 right, 1 up.
2. Obstacles: Walls and a `stop` rule blocking the path.
3. Available tools: `is` rules, `you` rule, `ball`, `door`.

Plan:
- Use the `is` rule to redefine ""baba"" as ""win"". For that, I need to move the `is` rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"".
- The existing `is` rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that `is` to connect to ""baba"" (which is at 2 left, 5 down) and ""win"" (8 right, 1 up), that would work. But how to navigate there.

Alternatively, use the `you` rule. Since I'm already ""you"" (due to ""baba is you""), maybe combining with another rule. For example, making ""you is win"" would make the win condition apply to me.

But to do that, I need to create a new rule ""you is win"" by moving the `is` rule next to ""you"" and ""win"".

Current `you` is at 1 step right and 5 steps down. The `win` is at 8 right, 1 up. The `is` rule is at 1 left and 1 up. So the path to get the `is` rule to the `you` and `win` might be possible.

Steps:
1. Move from Baba's position (2 left, 5 down) towards the `is` rule at 1 left, 1 up.
2. Move up to reach the `is` rule.
3. Once have the `is` rule, move it to the `you` (1 right, 5 down) and `win` (8 right, 1 up).

But navigating through the map is tricky. There are walls at 3 right, 1 up and others. Maybe need to push objects or find a path.

Alternatively, push the `ball` to the `door` to open it. The `door` is at 7 right, 2 down. The `ball` is at 6 right, 3 down. If I can move the `ball` to the `door`, perhaps the door becomes passable, allowing me to go through.

To push the `ball`, need to be adjacent to it and move in the same direction. The `ball` is 6 right, 3 down. My current position is 2 left, 5 down. So to get to the ball, I need to move right and down.

But there's a wall at 3 right, 5 down. So maybe can't go directly right. Maybe move down to 5 down to reach the `you` rule area, then right?

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of valid actions based on the last observation.

In the latest observation, the active rules are still ""baba is you"". The `is` rule is at 1 left, 1 up. The `ball` is 1 step up (from where? Maybe adjacent to the `is` rule). The `win` is 8 right, 1 up.

Possible actions:

- Move up to reach the `is` rule.
- Move right to try to navigate around walls.
- Maybe push the `ball` if adjacent.

But without knowing exact positions, it's hard. Let's assume I need to interact with the `is` rule. So moving up once to get closer.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules since I'm Baba. The goal seems to be getting to the ""win"" object, but there's also a door and balls involved. Let me look at the objects around.

First, the map layout based on the observation. I'm probably positioned somewhere, and there are several rules and objects. The ""win"" is at 8 steps to the right, which is probably the target. But there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which might block the way. There's also a ""door"" at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to move that door or change a rule to pass through it.

Looking at the rules: there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the left,"" which might be a movable text block. If I can rearrange the ""is"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule that changes ""win"" to something else, like making Baba the win condition. Or perhaps change ""door"" to ""win"" so I can push it over.

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you."" If I can move the ""is"" block that's 1 step to the left, maybe I can make a new rule like ""baba is win"" or ""win is you."" That way, either I become the win condition or the win is something I can interact with.

But first, I need to move. The last action was ""up,"" and now the observation shows that after moving up, the ""rule `is`"" is now 1 step to the left, and the ""win"" is 8 steps to the right. The ""ball"" is at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. There's a ""stop"" at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, which is a wall that can't be moved through normally.

My plan: Move towards the ""is"" rule that's 1 step to the left. If I can pick it up and move it next to ""baba"" or another object, I can create a new rule. Let's check if I can move left to reach that ""is"" rule. The current position of Baba isn't explicitly stated, but the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps left and 6 steps down. So maybe I need to navigate from there.

Alternatively, maybe pushing a ball towards the door? Because the door is a rule, maybe if I make the ball a ""win"" by changing a rule, then pushing the ball over the door would make it a win. But to do that, I need to alter the rules.

Another angle: The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can combine that with another rule. If I can make ""you"" into ""win,"" then I would be the win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win."" For example, move the ""is"" block to connect ""you"" and ""win,"" making ""you is win."" But where is the ""is"" block located?

In the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left. If I can move left to get to that ""is"" block, then I can rearrange it. But I have to check if I'm allowed to move left. Are there any STOP properties blocking the path? Looking at the walls and stop rules: there's a ""stop"" at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, but that's further down. If I'm currently at 2 steps left and 6 steps down (based on the ""rule `baba`"" position), moving left would take me to 1 step left and 6 steps down, which might be clear unless there's a wall there. The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions, so maybe moving left is possible.

So the steps could be:

1. Move left to reach the ""is"" rule that's 1 step to the left.
2. Once I have the ""is"" rule, move it next to the ""you"" rule (which is at 6 steps down) and the ""win"" rule (8 steps to the right) to create ""you is win.""
3. Then, since I'm Baba (you), I would be the win condition, allowing me to touch the win object without a door blocking.

But how to physically move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and either pick it up (if possible) and move it. The rules say I can only move objects or text blocks that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. The ""is"" rule is just a regular text block, so I can move it. So I should move left to grab the ""is"" rule, then move it to where the ""you"" and ""win"" are.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ball involved. If I can make the ball a ""win,"" then pushing it into the win area would work. To do that, I might need to create a rule like ""ball is win."" But the ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. So I need to move the ""is"" rule there. But that's a bit further.

Another possibility: The door at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can change the door's property, maybe make it passable. But I'm not sure how.

Let me recap the current positions:

- My position: rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 6 steps down. Assuming I'm at that position.
- The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left (from where? Probably relative to my position). So if I'm at 2 left, 6 down, then 1 step left would be 1 left, 6 down.
- The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, which I think is in the same row as my position, 6 steps down. So maybe my position is at 2 left, 6 down, and the ""you"" rule is directly below or above? Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 5 steps down in earlier observations, but in the latest, it's at 6 steps down. So I need to track that.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""is"" rule to create ""you is win."" To do that, I need to:

1. Move left from my current position (2 left, 6 down) to get to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 6 down.
2. Once I have the ""is"" rule, move it to the ""you"" rule's position (which is at 6 steps down, but I need to check the exact coordinates). Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 6 steps down. So if I'm at 2 left, 6 down, moving right would take me towards the ""is"" rule at 1 left. Wait, no. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left from somewhere. Maybe the coordinate system is relative. This part is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the best immediate action is to move left towards the ""is"" rule to grab it, then move it next to the ""you"" and ""win"" rules. So first action: move left.

Let's try to figure out what I need to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with things as Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right. However, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which means anything touching that is immovable.

My current position isn't specified directly, but based on the objects, I might be near the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left. The ball is 1 step to the right of that. If I move right, I can reach the ball. But why would I want the ball? Maybe I need to use it to change some rules.

The ""win"" is far to the right, blocked by walls and a stop. The door at 8 steps right and 3 down might be a way to get past the stop. But how? If I can make the door a different property, like ""open"" or remove the ""stop,"" that could help. 

Wait, the rules on the map include ""rule `is`"" that I can potentially move. If I can grab the ""is"" text block and place it next to ""door"" and ""open"" (assuming there's an ""open"" rule somewhere), I could make ""door is open."" But I don't see an ""open"" rule here. Alternatively, maybe make ""ball is win"" so that touching the ball makes me win. 

Let me check the objects again. There's a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 4 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" then ""ball is win"" would make the ball the win condition. Then I just need to reach the ball. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? The current rules are at 1 step left and 8 steps right. To get to the ball's position (8 steps right, 4 down), I need to navigate there. But there are walls and a stop in the way. The stop is at 3 steps right and 3 down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property, maybe by moving a text block next to it. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. If I can replace ""stop"" with another property, like ""push"" or something else. But I don't have those text blocks. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to make ""stop is nothing"" or similar. But ""nothing"" isn't a property here. 

Alternatively, use the ball to interact. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe pushing the ball. If I move right towards the ball, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; etc. So the path to the ball at 8 right, 4 down is blocked by walls and the stop. 

Hmm. Another angle: the ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step right and 6 down. If I can change that to make myself ""win,"" but I need to manipulate the rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" But where is the ""baba"" rule? There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 1 left and 6 down. If I can move that ""baba"" rule closer to an ""is"" and ""win,"" then I could set myself as win. 

But right now, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 6 down. To get to the ""win"" rule at 9 right, I need to move a lot. Alternatively, use the ball to move things. If I push the ball towards the ""is"" rule at 8 right, maybe I can rearrange the rules. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. The ball is at 8 right, 4 down. If I can move the ""is"" down to the ball's level, then place ""ball is win."" But how to move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba, and the only immovable things are ""stop"" or similar. The ""stop"" is at 3 right, 3 down. If I can avoid that area, maybe move left or right. 

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up, grab it, and carry it down to the ball's position. Then combine ""ball is win."" That would make touching the ball trigger a win. Then I just need to reach the ball. 

But to get there, I have to navigate past the walls. The path from my current position (assuming I'm near the initial ""is"" at 1 left) moving right would hit walls at 4 right. So maybe move up first, then right around the walls. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move up to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up.
2. Carry the ""is"" rule down to the ball's location (8 right, 4 down).
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to create ""ball is win.""
4. Then move to the ball and touch it to win.

But how to carry the ""is"" rule? In Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not ""stop."" Since ""is"" is a text block, and nothing makes it stop, I can pick it up and move it. 

So first, move right to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 up. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; etc. The ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up is to the right of the walls. So from my current position (maybe at 1 left), I need to move right past the walls. But the walls are at 4 right, so moving right from 1 left would require going through steps 2,3,4. Step 4 is a wall, so I can't go past that. Unless I can move around it. 

Wait, the map layout is a grid. Let me visualize it:

- Starting near rule `is` at 1 left.
- Ball is at 1 right.
- Walls at 4 right (various positions down).
- The ""is"" rule to grab is at 8 right, 1 up.

So to get to the 8 right, 1 up ""is"" rule, I need to move right from 1 left to 8 right. But between 1 and 8, there's a wall at 4 right. So I can't go straight right. Maybe move up first to avoid the wall. 

If I move up from the initial position (1 left), then right around the wall at 4 right. Let's say I move up, then right to 2,3,4, but 4 is a wall. So maybe up, right, up, right, etc., but need to check the exact positions. 

Alternatively, move up to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up directly. But that's 7 steps to the right from 1 left. Pass through walls at 4 right. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" can I push through walls? Wait, no. Walls are ""wall"" objects, and unless there's a rule saying ""baba can push wall"" or ""wall is push,"" I can't move through them. So I have to go around. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since the ball is at 8 right, 4 down, and the ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. If I can make the ball the win condition, then touching it would win. To do that, I need to create ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to them. 

So steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up.
2. Carry it down to 8 right, 4 down (where the ball is).
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win.""
4. Then move to the ball and touch it.

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to pathfind around the walls. From the initial position (assuming near 1 left), move up to avoid the wall at 4 right. Let's see:

- Current position: maybe at (0,0) assuming left is negative x and up is positive y.
- ""is"" rule at (8,1).
- Ball at (8,-3).
- Walls at (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), etc.

So to get from (0,0) to (8,1), need to go right, but can't pass (4,0). So alternate up and right.

Move up to (0,1), then right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), then up to (3,2), right to (4,2) — but (4,2) is a wall. So can't go there. Instead, move right to (4,1) which is a wall. Can't pass. Hmm, this is tricky.

Alternative path: Move up to (0,1), right to (1,1), up to (1,2), right to (2,2), up to (2,3), right to (3,3), up to (3,4), right to (4,4) — but that's a wall at (4,4)? Not sure. The map's walls are at 4 right and various downs. Maybe the path is clearer if I go around the back.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is at (8,1), maybe move right all the way to 8,1 directly, jumping over the walls. But since I can't move through walls, this isn't possible. So I need to find a way around.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ball towards the ""win"" rule. If I can make the ball movable by changing a rule. For example, if there's a ""push"" rule, but I don't see one. 

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" and other rules like ""wall is wall,"" ""win is win,"" etc. The ""is"" rules can be moved to create new rules. So perhaps the key is to create ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to them. 

To do that, I need to reach the ball's location with the ""is"" rule. Let's assume I can move the ""is"" from (8,1) to (8,4) by carrying it down. Then place it between ball and win. 

So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""is"" at (8,1).
2. Carry it down to (8,4).
3. Place it to create ""ball is win.""
4. Then move to the ball and touch it.

To move the ""is"" rule, I need to pathfind. Starting from where? If I'm at (1,0) near the initial ""is"" at (1,-1) maybe. Not sure. But assuming I can reach the ""is"" at (8,1), then carry it down.

Once ""ball is win"" is active, touching the ball would make me win. So the next step is to move to the ball. 

But how to get past the walls and the stop rule at (3,3). The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property, maybe by moving a text block next to it. For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing"" or override it with another rule. 

The ""stop"" rule is at (3,3). If I can move the ""is"" rule there and make ""stop is push"" or something, then it would no longer be stop. But that requires having the ""is"" rule available. 

Alternatively, since I'm carrying the ""is"" rule to (8,4), maybe I can detour to (3,3) first to remove the stop. But that might take too many steps. 

This is quite complex. Maybe the immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" rule at (8,1) to start creating the new rule. So the first step is to move right towards that ""is"" rule, avoiding the wall at (4,0). 

But how? Let's say I'm at (0,0). To get to (8,1):

- Move up to (0,1).
- Right to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1).
- Up to (3,2).
- Right to (4,2) — but is (4,2) a wall? According to the observation, wall is at 4 right and 1 step down (which would be (4,-1)), and other positions down. So (4,2) might be empty. 
- Continue right to (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2).
- Down to (8,1).

This path avoids the walls. So the actions would be:

up, right, right, right, up, right, right, right, right, down.

But since each action is one step, I need to sequence them. However, the user is asking for the next action, not the entire path. So the immediate action should be the first step towards the ""is"" rule. 

Currently, the last observation had the active rules and objects, and the agent's previous action was ""left,"" leading to this state. So where is the agent now? The observation doesn't specify the agent's position, but based on the previous actions, maybe the agent is near the ""is"" rule at (8,1) or somewhere else. 

Assuming the agent is near the ""is"" rule at (8,1) after moving there, the next step is to pick up the ""is"" rule and move it down to the ball's location. So the action would be to take the ""is"" rule (which is adjacent?) and move it down. 

But in the game, you interact with text blocks by moving onto them and then moving in a direction to place them. So to move the ""is"" rule, the agent would need to be adjacent to it, pick it up (by moving onto it), and then move in a direction to carry it. 

In the current observation, the ""is"" rule is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. If the agent is to the left of that, say at 7 right, 1 up, they can move right to grab it. Then move down towards the ball. 

So the immediate action could be ""right"" to reach the ""is"" rule, then ""down"" to carry it. But since the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, I need to see where the agent is. 

Wait, the current observation doesn't explicitly state the agent's position. It lists the objects, including the ""rule `is`"" at various places, but where is Baba (the agent)? The rules include ""baba is you,"" but the agent's position isn't specified. This makes it harder to determine the next move. 

Perhaps the agent is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So ( -1, -6 ). The ""win"" is at (9,1). To get there, need to navigate around walls. 

Alternatively, the agent is near the initial ""is"" rule at 1 step left. But without knowing the agent's position, it's challenging. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest bet is to focus on manipulating the rules to make the ball the win condition. The key is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win."" 

So the immediate action should be to move towards the ""is"" rule at 8 right, 1 up. Assuming the agent is to the left, the action would be ""right."" 

Alternatively, if the agent is already near the ""is"" rule, the action would be to move down towards the ball. 

But based on the previous actions, the agent was moving left, which might have brought it closer to the ""is"" rule. 

In the last few steps, the agent tried moving left, up, right, etc., but failed due to invalid actions. Now, in the current observation, the agent needs to decide the next move. 

Considering all this, the best action is to move right towards the ""is"" rule at 8 steps right, 1 step up to grab it and then move it down to the ball's location to create the ""ball is win"" rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right. But wait, are there any other rules that might change the win condition? Let me see... Hmm, there's also a ""ball"" rule at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.

Right now, I'm positioned at the initial position, probably where ""baba"" is located. The map has several walls and stop rules that might block my path. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, so I need to be careful not to run into that. The door is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down, but I don't know if I can pass through it unless there's a rule allowing it.

I need to move towards the ""win"" object at 8 steps right. But the path might be blocked. Let me check the objects between me and the win. From the current position, moving right directly might hit a wall at 4 steps right. So I need to find a way around. Maybe moving up or down first?

Looking at the layout, if I move up, I see a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left. Maybe I can pick up that rule and rearrange it. But wait, can I move the ""is"" rule? The rules are probably movable unless they're part of an immovable object. Since ""is"" is a standalone rule, I might be able to move it.

If I move right twice, I reach the wall at 4 steps right. But if I go up first, then maybe I can reposition the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or something like that, then I could turn myself into the win object. But how?

Alternatively, the ""ball"" is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball,"" I could make ""ball is win,"" changing the win condition to the ball. Then I just need to reach the ball. But I'm not sure if that's the intended solution.

Another angle: The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can combine rules. If I can move the ""you"" rule to be under ""baba,"" but I don't see how that helps directly.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can turn that into something else, maybe remove the stop property. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and change its property. For example, ""stop is nothing"" or something. But I don't know if that's possible here.

Alternatively, maybe I need to push a wall or a stop object. But the problem states I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So walls and stop objects are immovable. That means I can't push them out of the way, but I can move text blocks that define their properties.

So the key is to manipulate the text blocks to create new rules. For instance, if I move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step left to be next to the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right, I could make ""baba is win,"" which would mean I turn into the win condition. But how do I get there?

Let me visualize the map. Currently, my position isn't explicitly stated, but the ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 6 steps down. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right. So I need to move from my position to the right, but there are walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule that's 2 steps left to be adjacent to ""baba,"" making ""baba is win."" But how? If I can move that ""is"" rule up or down to be next to ""baba,"" then I can create the new rule. 

Looking at the positions:

- ""baba"" is at 2 steps left and 6 steps down.
- ""is"" is at 2 steps left (same horizontal), but 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. Wait, the observation says ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" So that ""is"" is positioned one step left of where ""baba"" is. If I can move that ""is"" rule up or down to be adjacent to ""baba,"" then I can make ""baba is [something].""

But the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which is probably from another ""is"" rule. The ""is"" at 1 step left and 6 steps down is part of the ""you"" rule: ""rule `you` 6 steps down."" So maybe that ""is"" is part of defining ""you.""

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step left and 6 steps down to be next to ""baba,"" so we can create ""baba is win"" by placing the ""win"" rule next to it.
2. To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""is"" rule is and move it. But I'm currently at ""baba"" position. Let's see:

Current position of ""baba"": 2 step to the left and 6 steps down.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So that's one step left from ""baba."" If I move left from ""baba,"" I can reach that ""is"" rule. But can I move left? Are there any walls in that direction?

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Wait, the ""wall"" is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So moving left from ""baba"" (which is at 2 step left, 6 down) to 1 step left, 6 down would be possible unless there's a wall there. But the walls are at 2 step left and 1 step down, and others further right. So moving left one step should be clear.

So action: left.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I need to move it to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right. But that's a long distance. Alternatively, maybe create a rule that makes ""baba"" equal to ""win"" by placing the ""is"" next to both.

Wait, the way rules work in Baba Is You is that you place a text block next to a subject and property. For example, ""BABA IS YOU"" is a rule where ""BABA"" is the subject, ""IS"" is the connector, and ""YOU"" is the property. So to create a new rule like ""BABA IS WIN,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win.""

But currently, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. If I move that ""is"" rule up to be next to ""baba,"" which is at 2 step left and 6 steps down, then place the ""win"" rule next to it, I can create ""baba is win.""

So steps:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" rule.
2. Move up to position it next to ""baba.""
3. Move right to place it next to ""win.""

But considering the map layout, after moving left to get the ""is"" rule, moving up might hit a wall? Let's check the walls:

- There's a wall at 2 step left and 1 step down. So if I'm at 1 step left and 6 steps down (after moving left), moving up would be to 1 step left, 5 steps down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the observation, the walls are at specific positions. The walls listed are:

wall 2 steps to the right (probably from origin)
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
etc.

So vertical walls are more to the right. On the left side, the only wall mentioned is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So moving up from 1 step left, 6 down should be possible.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, moving up to 1 step left, 5 down, then right to 2 step left (baba's position), then place the ""is"" there. Then move right again to get to the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right. But that's a long distance with walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" and ""you"" is an object that can be moved, perhaps I can push the ""win"" rule by moving towards it. But ""win"" is a rule, not an object with movement properties unless modified.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is a static text block unless we change its definition. So unless we make ""win"" a movable object, we can't push it. But with the current rules, ""win"" is just a label.

Hmm, maybe the solution is to make the ""ball"" the win condition. If I can create ""ball is win,"" then reaching the ball would make me win. The ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

But getting to the ball's position would require moving through walls. Let's see:

The ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. To get there, I need to move right from my current position (baba at 2 left, 6 down). But the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right and various downs. For example, at 4 steps right, there's a wall, and moving down from there has more walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to create ""baba is win"" by repositioning the ""is"" rule. Let's try that.

1. Move left to get the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 6 down.
2. Move up to 1 left, 5 down.
3. Move right to 2 left (baba's position), 5 down. Place the ""is"" here to make ""baba is [something]"". Then need to move the ""win"" rule next to it.
4. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right. That's a far distance, but perhaps by moving the ""is"" rule and then the ""win"" rule adjacent to it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Another observation: the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. Since I'm already ""you,"" maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I'm you. So the goal is to reach the ""win"" object. If I can make myself the win object, then just standing on the win rule would suffice. To do that, create ""baba is win"" by placing the ""is"" rule next to both.

So, steps:

1. Move left to get the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 6 down.
2. Move up to 1 left, 5 down (avoiding walls).
3. Move right to 2 left (baba's position), 5 down.
4. Place the ""is"" rule here, making ""baba is [win]"". But where is the ""win"" rule? It's at 8 right. So I need to bring the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ""is"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is at 8 right, which is far away. This seems difficult.

Alternatively, use another ""is"" rule that's already on the map. There's another ""is"" rule at 7 steps right, 1 step up. Maybe use that.

Wait, the objects include:

rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up

So the ""is"" at 8 right, 1 up and ""win"" at 9 right, 1 up. If I can move the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win.""

But how to get there? From my current position (baba at 2 left, 6 down), moving right would hit walls. Maybe need to go up first.

This is getting quite complex. Let me think differently. Maybe the solution is to move the ""you"" rule to be under ""baba,"" but that's already the case (""baba is you""). Not helpful.

Alternatively, make ""stop"" into something else. For example, ""stop is nothing,"" removing the stop property from the stop rule. But that would require moving the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and changing its property. Let's see:

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 3 down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there and make ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop wall would become passable. Then I could path through.

But how to reach the ""stop"" rule? From my current position, moving right would require navigating past walls. Let's see:

Current position: baba at 2 left, 6 down.

To get to stop at 2 right, 3 down:

Path: Need to move right from 2 left to 2 right (passing through 0, 1, 2 steps right), but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and various downs. Let me check:

- wall 3 steps to the right (position 3 right)
- wall 3 steps right and 1 down (3r,1d)
- wall 3r,2d
- rule stop at 2r,3d
- etc.

So from 2 left,6d, moving right towards 2r would pass through:

0r: clear?
1r: clear?
2r: stop rule at 2r,3d (but that's down 3 steps). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. The way the positions are described might be relative to the player's current position. For example, ""1 step up"" is relative. So the absolute positions might be different.

This is getting too confusing without a visual map. Maybe I should focus on the immediate objects around me.

The ""is"" rule is 1 step left and 6 steps down. If I move left to grab it, then move up to a position where I can place it next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, maybe there's a nearby ""win"" rule that I can reach. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right, which is far, but perhaps there's a way to push it.

Wait, another approach: In some levels, you can push objects by moving towards them when you're a certain type. For example, if you're a rock, you can push other rocks. But here, I'm Baba, and the rules haven't been changed yet. So I can't push walls or stops.

Alternatively, if I can make myself a door, then I can move through walls. But to do that, I'd need to create ""baba is door.""

But how? Let's see. There's a ""door"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba is door,"" then I could walk through walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""door.""

So steps:

1. Move left to get the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 6 down.
2. Move up to 1 left, 5 down.
3. Move right to 2 left (baba's position), 5 down.
4. Place the ""is"" rule here, then move down to 2 left, 6 down (baba's original position).
5. Move right to 3 left,6 down (but there's a wall at 2 left,1 down, but maybe not here).
Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should just try moving left to get the ""is"" rule and see what happens.

76,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and push things if they're not stopped. My current position is at the rule `is` 1 step to the left, and there's a ball 1 step to the right. The goal is to reach the `win` object, which is 9 steps to the right.

Looking at the objects, there are walls and stop rules blocking the path directly right. The `stop` rule is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down, so anything hitting that stops. The `door` is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down, but I don't know if that's useful yet. The `ball` is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. Maybe moving the ball towards the win condition?

Wait, but how do I get past the walls? The walls are at 4 steps right and 1 step down, and others further down. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe I can rewrite rules. There's a rule `is` at 8 steps right. If I can move that `is` next to another object, like making ""ball is win"" or ""baba is win,"" that could change the game.

But first, I need to reach that `is` rule. The ball is nearby. If I move right towards the ball, then maybe push it. But the ball is 1 step to the right of me. If I move right, I could be next to the ball. However, the path to the ball might be blocked. Let me check the positions again.

Current position: rule `is` 1 step to the left. So my position is left of the `is` rule. The ball is 1 step to the right, so maybe I'm adjacent? If I move right, I can get to the ball. Once I have the ball, perhaps I can move it towards the `win` rule. But the `win` is 9 steps right, so the ball is at 8 steps right and 4 down. Maybe moving the ball up or down?

Alternatively, the `is` rule at 8 steps right could be moved to create a new rule. For example, if I move the `is` next to the `win`, making ""win is win"" which is redundant, but maybe not helpful. Or move it to the `ball` to make ""ball is win,"" changing the win condition to the ball. That way, pushing the ball to where I am would make me win.

But how to move the `is` rule? To move a text block, it has to not be stopped. The `is` rule at 8 steps right is next to a wall (4 steps right) and other objects. Wait, the `is` at 8 steps right is probably isolated. So I can move it around. Let's say I move right towards the `is` at 8 steps right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm.

Wait, my current position is 1 step to the left of the `is` rule. So maybe I can move right to get to that `is` rule. Let's see: current position is at `is` 1 step left. If I move right once, I reach the `is` rule. Then, I can move it further right to attach to the `win` rule. But the `win` is at 9 steps right. So if I move the `is` from 8 to 9 steps right next to `win`, creating ""win is win"" which doesn't help. Alternatively, move the `is` to the `ball` at 8 steps right and 4 down. Wait, the `ball` is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down, while the `is` is at 8 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe I need to move down to reach the `ball`.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move right to reach the `is` rule at 8 steps right.
2. Move the `is` rule down to the `ball`'s position (8 right, 4 down).
3. Create the rule ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition.
4. Push the ball to my current position, thus winning.

But how to physically move the `is` rule? Each move action is either directional. So I need to be adjacent to the `is` rule to move it. Let's check the current map layout.

From the observation, after previous actions, the `is` rule is at 8 steps to the right. My current position is 1 step to the left of that `is` rule. So if I move right twice, I can get to the `is` rule. But wait, the path might be blocked. Let me visualize:

- I'm at position (left of `is` rule at 8 right).
- Moving right once gets me to the `is` rule.
- Then, from there, I can move the `is` rule in any direction, as long as the target cell is not a STOP or similar.

The `is` rule at 8 right is next to the `win` at 9 right. If I move the `is` to 9 right, adjacent to `win`, creating ""win is win"" which is allowed but doesn't change the win condition. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the `is` down to the `ball`. The `ball` is at 8 right, 4 down. So from the `is` at 8 right, 1 up, moving down 3 steps would reach the `ball`. But each move has to be one step at a time. So:

- Move right to get to the `is` at 8 right.
- Then move down three times to reach the `ball` at 8 right, 4 down.
- Place the `is` next to the `ball`, creating ""ball is win.""

Once that's done, the ball becomes the win object. Then, if I can push the ball to where I am (or to a position where I can touch it), I would win.

But how to push the ball? Since I'm ""baba is you,"" and the ball is a regular object unless a rule says otherwise. If ""ball is push"" or similar, but the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" Assuming balls can be pushed like regular objects (unless there's a stop rule), I could push the ball.

So the steps would be:

1. Move right to the `is` at 8 right.
2. Move down to the `ball`'s position.
3. Move the `is` next to the `ball` to create ""ball is win.""
4. Move left or right to push the ball towards the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. The `you` rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step to the right. Maybe I can manipulate that to make myself ""win.""

But the active rule is still ""baba is you."" To change the win condition, I need to create a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""win is you.""

Another approach: since I'm you, if I can touch the `win` object, I win. But the `win` is at 9 steps right, which is blocked by walls and stops. The direct path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and down steps. So maybe need to find an alternate path using moved rules.

Alternatively, use the `door` at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can open the door by creating a ""door is key"" rule, but I don't have a key object. Not sure.

Wait, the `stop` rule is at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. So anything hitting that stops. The `door` is a passable object unless stopped. But without a key, maybe can't open it.

Back to the original idea: create ""ball is win."" Then push the ball to me. The ball is at 8 steps right, 4 steps down. My current position is 1 step left of the `is` at 8 right. So if I can get to the ball's position, move the `is` there, then push the ball.

But moving from my current position to the ball's position requires moving right, down, etc. Let's see:

Current position: 1 step left of `is` at 8 right. So I'm at 7 right, same level as the `is` rule up.

To get to the ball at 8 right, 4 down:

- Move right once to reach 8 right, same level as `is` (1 up).
- Then move down three times to reach 4 down.
- Then, move the `is` rule down to be next to the ball.

Alternatively, once I'm at 8 right, 1 up, I can move down to 8 right, 2 down, then 3 down, then 4 down (ball's position). Then, place the `is` rule next to the ball. Let's say at 8 right, 4 down, the ball is there. If I place `is` to the left of the ball (7 right, 4 down), creating ""ball is win.""

Once that rule is in place, the ball becomes the win object. Then, if I can push the ball to my current position (which is at 7 right, same as the original `is` position), but I'm now at 8 right, 4 down beside the ball. Wait, maybe I need to move back to where I can push the ball.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's outline the exact steps:

1. From current position (left of `is` at 8 right), move right to get to the `is` rule.
2. Move down three times to reach the ball's position (8 right, 4 down).
3. Move the `is` rule to the left or right of the ball to create ""ball is win.""
4. Now, the ball is win. Push the ball towards me or to a position where I can touch it.

But how to push the ball? Since I'm ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""stop"" on the ball, I should be able to push it. So after creating ""ball is win,"" moving left or right into the ball would push it, and if I end up on the ball, since I'm you and the ball is win, that should trigger the win condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` rule closer. The `win` is at 9 right. If I can move it left to 8 right, adjacent to the ball, but that would require having a rule like ""win is move"" or something, which I don't have.

Another angle: the `you` rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. Maybe I can combine that with the `is` rule to make ""you is win,"" but I'm not sure. Or move the `you` rule somewhere else.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are objects on the map that can be picked up and moved.

So the key is to move the `is` rule to create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes the ball win.

Let me try to simulate the moves:

Current position: (assumed) at the `is` rule 1 step to the left. So coordinates might be (7 right, same Y as the `is` up).

Move right once to reach the `is` at 8 right, 1 up.

Now, from there, move down three times to reach 8 right, 4 down (ball's position).

Once there, look at the ball. To create ""ball is win,"" I need to move the `is` rule next to the ball. So from 8 right, 4 down (ball's position), move the `is` to, say, 7 right, 4 down (left of the ball), making the rule ""ball is win.""

Then, the ball becomes win. Now, I need to push the ball. Since I'm at 8 right, 4 down (next to the ball), I can move left into the ball, pushing it to 7 right, 4 down. Then, if I follow, I'd be at 7 right, 4 down, and the ball at 6 right, 4 down. But does touching the ball count as winning? Since the ball is now win, if I touch it, I win.

Alternatively, after creating ""ball is win,"" I can just stand next to the ball and win immediately. Wait, no— touching the win object is required. So if the ball is win, and I'm adjacent to it, do I win? Or do I have to move onto it?

In Baba Is You, usually, you win by touching the win object. So if the ball is win, and I'm adjacent to it, I might not win unless I move onto it. So after creating the rule, I need to move onto the ball.

So steps:

1. Move right to `is` at 8 right, 1 up.
2. Move down three times to 8 right, 4 down (ball's position).
3. Move `is` left to 7 right, 4 down: creating ""ball is win.""
4. Now, ball is win. Move left into the ball, pushing it to 6 right, 4 down. Then move left again to be on the ball, winning.

But how to execute this in the game's move actions? Each move is a single step, and I have to specify the direction.

Alternatively, after step 3, I'm at 8 right, 4 down (adjacent to the ball and the moved `is`). Then, move left to push the ball to 7 right, 4 down. Then move left again to be on the ball at 7 right, 4 down, thus winning.

So the sequence would be:

- Right (to get to the `is`)
- Down three times
- Left (to move `is` next to ball)
- Left (to push ball)
- Left (to touch ball)

But each of these is a separate action. The user is asking for the next action based on the current observation.

In the current observation, after previous moves, the `is` is at 8 steps right. My position is 1 step left of that `is`, so I need to move right once to reach it.

So the next action should be ""right"" to get to the `is` rule.

There's also a ball seven steps to the right and four steps down. The ""you"" rule is at six steps down, which I assume is where I need to get to reach the ""win.""

Hmm, the goal is usually to reach the ""win,"" but since the rules can be changed, maybe I need to manipulate them. The ""rule `is`"" to the left might be important. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to another object, I can change its property. For example, if I bring the ""is"" next to ""baba,"" I could make ""baba"" something else, like ""win"" or ""you.""

But right now, I'm controlled by ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely except where there are ""stop"" or ""wall"" rules. The walls are at 3 and 4 steps to the right, so I need to navigate around them. The ""stop"" is at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which I probably can't pass through.

Looking at the ball at 7 steps right and 4 down, maybe that's a key object. If I can make the ball into a ""win,"" that would be the solution. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `is`"" next to the ball and change its property. But currently, the ""rule `is`"" is at 2 steps left, which is pretty far. I need to move right to reach it.

Wait, the last observation shows the ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps to the left. If I move right, maybe I can grab that ""is"" rule and carry it to the ball. But can I pick up the ""is"" rule? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not a ""stop"" or ""wall."" The ""is"" rule is a movable object unless it's under a ""stop"" rule, but here it's just on the map.

So, moving right towards the ""is"" rule at 2 steps left. Let me check the positions again. The current position of the player (Baba) is probably where the ""rule `baba`"" is located, which is 2 steps to the left and 6 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left, so if I move right once, I can get to the ""is"" rule. Then, move it to the ball's location at 7 steps right and 4 down. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" is nine steps to the right. If I can reach that, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So maybe the path is blocked. But if I can turn a wall into a ""stop"" or remove it by changing its rule, that might help. For instance, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere, but I don't see that active here.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other objects are either walls, stop, door, ball, etc., but their properties are determined by the rules. The ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left"" means that wherever that rule is placed, that object becomes a wall. Similarly, the ""rule `is`"" can be moved to change properties.

So perhaps the key is to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" to change its property. If I make ""win"" into something interactable, but currently, ""win"" is just a win condition. Alternatively, make myself ""win"" by moving ""is"" to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is already defined with ""is"" at 1 step left and 6 steps down. Let me see: the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down, and another ""is"" at 1 step left and 6 steps down. So if I move the ""is"" next to ""baba,"" I could change ""baba"" to ""win.""

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is a text block that says ""BABA IS [something]."" The current rule for ""baba"" is split into two parts: ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" So combining those, it would be ""BABA IS YOU"" at that position. But the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. So maybe if I can move the ""is"" next to ""baba,"" I can change the property. For example, moving the ""is"" to make ""baba"" ""win"" instead of ""you.""

But how to do that? The ""is"" rule is currently at 2 steps to the left. If I move right towards it, pick it up, and then move it to the ""baba"" rule's location. Let's see: the ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down, and the ""is"" is at 2 step to the left (same x-coordinate) but maybe different y. Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 2 step to the left, and the ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down. So vertically, the ""is"" is at the same x as the ""baba"" rule but higher up. If I can move the ""is"" down to the ""baba"" rule's position and place it next to it, then the rule would become ""BABA IS [new property].""

But the ""is"" rule is currently 2 steps to the left. If I move right, I can reach it. Let's say I move right once to get to the ""is"" rule. Then, move down to the ""baba"" rule's location. From the ""is"" at 2 steps left, moving down 5 steps would get to the ""baba"" rule. Then, placing the ""is"" next to ""baba"" would change its property. For example, if I make ""baba"" ""win,"" then I (being baba) would be win.

Alternatively, maybe I need to reach the ""win"" at 9 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls and stops. However, if I can turn those into passable objects by changing their rules. For instance, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, but I don't see that. The only active rule is ""baba is you.""

Another approach: the ball is at 7 steps right and 4 down. If I can make the ball ""win,"" then stepping on it would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and set it to ""win."" So from my current position (2 step left, 6 down), I need to move right to reach the ""is"" at 2 step left (same x), then move right to 7 steps right, and down to 4 steps down. But there are walls in the way. The wall is at 3 steps right, so moving right from the ""is"" rule (which is at 2 step left, so position x=2?), then moving right to x=3 is a wall. So I can't go straight right.

Maybe I need to move around the walls. Let me visualize the map:

- Top area: rule `is` at left, ball up, walls to the right.
- Middle: stop at 2 right, 3 down.
- Bottom: rule `you` at 6 down.

The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 6 down. To get to the ""is"" rule at 2 left, same x, so moving up or down. Wait, the ""is"" rule is 2 step to the left, which would be in the same column as Baba's position. If Baba is at 2 left and 6 down, then the ""is"" rule is also at 2 left, but maybe higher up. So moving up from Baba's position would reach the ""is"" rule.

Yes, in the last observation, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from the initial position, but in the current observation, it's 2 step to the left. Wait, the observations are changing as the player moves. Let's parse the latest observation:

Current Observation:

Active rules:
baba is you

Objects on the map:
rule `is` 2 step to the left
wall 3 steps to the right
rule `is` 7 steps to the right
rule `win` 8 steps to the right
rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 1 step down
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down
rule `door` 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down
rule `ball` 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 5 steps down
rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down
rule `you` 6 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 6 steps down

So the ""rule `is`"" is at 2 steps to the left. The player (Baba) is at the position of ""rule `baba`"": 2 step to the left and 6 steps down. The other ""is"" is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, which is part of the ""you"" rule. 

To get to the ""is"" at 2 steps left, which is in the same column as Baba's position (2 step left), but perhaps one step up or down. Since Baba is at 6 steps down, and the ""is"" is at 2 step to the left (same x) but maybe same y? Wait, the description says ""rule `is` 2 step to the left""—does that mean 2 steps left from Baba's current position, or 2 steps left from some origin?

This is a bit confusing. Assuming that all positions are relative to Baba's current position. So if the ""rule `is`"" is 2 steps to the left of Baba, then it's in that direction. But in the current observation, Baba's position is at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down,"" which might mean that the map's origin is somewhere else, and all positions are relative to that.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are absolute. For example, the ""rule `is`"" is at position (x=2, y=0), walls at (x=3, y=1), etc. But without a visual map, it's hard to tell. 

Assuming that the player (Baba) is at a certain position, and the objects are located relative to that. The key is to move the ""is"" rule next to either the ""win"" or the ""ball"" to change their properties. 

Let's focus on making the ball the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball (7 steps right, 4 down) and set it to ""win."" But the path is blocked by walls and a stop at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. 

Alternatively, make Baba into the win by changing the ""baba"" rule. The current ""baba"" rule is split into two parts: ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" Combining these, it's ""BABA IS YOU"" at that position. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" text block, I can change it to ""BABA IS WIN,"" making Baba the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule (currently at 2 steps left) to the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So from the ""is"" at 2 steps left (assuming same y), moving down 1 step to reach the ""baba"" rule's y-coordinate (5 steps down). Then place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" to form ""BABA IS WIN.""

So the steps would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (2 left, 6 down) to the ""is"" rule at 2 left (same x). Since they're in the same column, moving up or down. The ""is"" is probably one step up or down. If it's one step up, moving up once gets there.

2. Pick up the ""is"" rule and carry it down to the ""baba"" rule's location (5 steps down).

3. Place the ""is"" next to the ""baba"" text block to create ""BABA IS WIN.""

4. Now, since Baba is ""you"" and ""win,"" touching the win condition would trigger the win.

Alternatively, if I can reach the ""win"" at 8 steps right by changing the walls into passable objects. But the walls are at 3 and 4 steps right, which are in the way. Maybe using the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can turn that into something else, but I don't have a relevant rule for that.

Another angle: the ""door"" at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can open the door, but I don't see a ""key"" or ""open"" rule. The active rule is only ""baba is you.""

So the most promising path is to change the ""baba"" rule to ""win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" text block. The ""is"" is currently at 2 steps left. If I move right from Baba's position (2 left, 6 down) to reach the ""is,"" but wait, the ""is"" is at 2 steps left, same as Baba's x-coordinate. So moving up or down from Baba's position would get to the ""is"" rule. 

Assuming the ""is"" is one step up from Baba, moving up once would reach it. Then, carrying the ""is"" down to the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down. From Baba's position (6 down), moving down once gets to 5 down, which is where the ""baba"" rule is. Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" to make ""BABA IS WIN.""

Once that's done, since Baba is both ""you"" and ""win,"" touching the win condition (even if it's just Baba himself) would win the level. 

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move up to pick up the ""is"" rule.
2. Move down to the ""baba"" rule's location.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" to make it ""BABA IS WIN.""
4. Now, as ""you"" and ""win,"" the level is solved.

But how to execute this in the game? The player needs to move physically to those positions. Let's check the current positions again.

Baba's position is at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down."" The ""is"" rule is at 2 step to the left, which is the same x-coordinate. If the ""is"" is one step up from Baba, then moving up once would reach it. Then, moving down once to reach the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down. 

So the actions would be:

- Up (to get to the ""is"" rule)
- Down (to reach the ""baba"" rule's location)
- Place the ""is"" next to ""baba""

But in the game, you have to move the text blocks by carrying them. So after moving up to the ""is"" rule, you would pick it up (by moving onto it) and then carry it down to the ""baba"" rule's spot. 

However, the problem is that the game might require specific movement steps. Let's look at the latest observation:

Objects on the map include the ""rule `is`"" at 2 step to the left. Assuming that's in the same row as Baba, which is at 6 steps down. So if the ""is"" is 2 steps left and same y as Baba (6 down), then moving left twice would reach it, but that might not be correct. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" could be in a different row. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map. 

Another approach: since the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, and Baba is also at 6 steps down, perhaps the solution is to reach that ""you"" rule and combine it with another rule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the ball is at 7 steps right and 4 down. If I can move the ""is"" there and make the ball ""win,"" then stepping on it would win. To get there, I need to move right past the wall at 3 steps right. But how? The wall is at 3 steps right, 1 step down. So moving right from Baba's position (assuming he's at 0,0), moving right 3 steps would hit the wall. So that's blocked.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to use the ""door"" at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can make the door passable, but I don't have a ""key"" rule. 

Alternatively, change the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right, 3 steps down into something else. But again, I need an ""is"" rule next to it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule there and make it ""stop"" into another property, but I'm not sure.

This is tricky. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach ""win"" or make self ""win.""
- Active rules: Only ""baba is you.""
- Key objects: ""is"" rules, ball, win, stop, walls.

Possible solution:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is win.""
2. Now, as ""you"" and ""win,"" touching the win condition (even Baba himself) would win.

78,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right. But wait, the ""win"" object might be defined elsewhere. Let me check the objects again. Oh, right, there's a ""win"" object at 8 steps to the right. But there's also a ""door"" at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to interact with that.

Baba is currently at 2 steps to the left and 6 steps down, according to the rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down. So my position is somewhere there. The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, which matches up since ""baba is you"" makes me actionable.

The main obstacles are walls and a ""stop"" rule. The walls are at various positions, and the stop is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. I need to avoid those. The ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down, but I'm not sure if interacting with it is necessary.

The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" property blocking. Let me see the movement options. From my current position (2 left, 6 down), possible moves are up, down, left, right. But looking at the map, moving left would take me to where the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 down, which might not block me. Moving right would head towards the walls at 3 steps right. Moving up might get me to the ""is"" rule at the top, but I need to reach the ""win"" at 8 right.

Wait, maybe I need to manipulate the rules. The ""is"" rules are floating around. If I can move them to create new rules, like ""baba is win"" or ""win is you,"" that could change the objective. But to do that, I need to pick up the ""is"" text block and place it near the desired objects.

Looking at the current ""is"" rules: one is at 2 left (near me), and another at 7 right. The ""win"" is at 8 right, so if I can move the ""is"" from 7 right to next to the ""win"" at 8 right, making ""win is [something]"". But the ""win"" is an object, so maybe ""win is you"" would make touching it win. Alternatively, ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition.

But how to get the ""is"" block to the ""win""? The ""is"" at 7 right is already close to the ""win"" at 8 right. If I can move that ""is"" one step right to attach to the ""win"", then ""win is..."" but what's after? If I can make it ""win is you"", then touching the win object would make me win. Alternatively, if I make ""baba is win"", then I'd be the win.

But first, I need to move the ""is"" block. To do that, I have to be adjacent to it and move in the direction of the block, right? The ""is"" at 7 right is a text block. Since I'm at 2 left, 6 down, that's quite far. The other ""is"" is at 2 left, which is where I am? Wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 6 steps down. So maybe the ""is"" at 2 left is near me. Let me confirm the positions.

The objects list shows:
- rule `is` 2 step to the left
- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down

So the ""is"" at 2 left is probably at the same vertical level as Baba, 6 steps down. So if I'm at 2 left, 6 down, and there's a ""is"" rule also at 2 left, same vertical, then horizontally, maybe one step apart? So I could move right to grab that ""is"" rule.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it to the ""win"" at 8 right. Let's see. From my position (2 left, 6 down), moving right would take me to 1 left, then 0 left, etc., towards the ""is"" at 2 left. Wait, if the ""is"" is 2 steps to the left of Baba's position, which is 2 left and 6 down, then maybe the ""is"" is directly left of Baba? So moving left from Baba's position would reach the ""is"" rule. But wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 6 down, so perhaps the coordinate system is such that ""left"" decreases the x-coordinate. So if I'm at position (0,0), then left would be negative x.

Assuming that, the ""is"" rule is at (-2, 6) if Baba is at (0,0). To reach it, I need to move left. But earlier actions had the assistant moving right, left, up, etc. Maybe the previous attempts were trying to navigate towards the ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" at 2 step to the left is in the same row as Baba. So if I'm at position (2 left, 6 down), the ""is"" is also at 2 left, same down level. Then moving in the horizontal direction (left or right) might get me there.

But given the previous failed actions, perhaps the assistant was trying to move in the wrong direction. Now, the current observation shows that after several moves, the ""is"" rule is still at 2 step to the left, and the ""win"" is at 8 right.

The key is to pick up the ""is"" rule and place it next to the ""win"" to create a new rule like ""win is you"" or ""baba is win"". Since ""baba is you"" is already active, if I make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would make me win. Alternatively, making ""win is you"" would also work.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 2 left to near the ""win"" at 8 right. The distance is quite big, but step by step.

From the current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule at 2 left, 6 down), moving right towards the ""is"" at 2 left (wait, that's the same x-coordinate?), maybe the ""is"" is in a different row. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""is"" at 2 step to the left is in the same vertical line as Baba. So moving horizontally left or right to reach it. Once I grab the ""is"", then move right towards the ""win"" at 8 steps right.

But the previous attempts had the assistant moving right, left, up, etc., but maybe those were incorrect. Now, the correct action would be to move left to get to the ""is"" rule, pick it up, and then move right towards the ""win"".

However, the problem is that the assistant's previous actions led to defaults because the reasoning wasn't clear. So the correct action here should be to move towards the ""is"" rule to manipulate it.

Given the current observation, the ""is"" rule is at 2 step to the left. If I'm at Baba's position (2 left, 6 down), then moving left would take me further away. Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that ""left"" is towards negative x, and ""right"" is positive. So if the ""is"" is 2 steps to the left of Baba, then to reach it, I need to move left twice. But earlier actions might have moved in the wrong direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""is"" is in a different row. This is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Locate the ""is"" rule that can be moved. There are two ""is"" rules: one at 2 left and another at 7 right.
2. The ""win"" is at 8 right. The ""is"" at 7 right is adjacent to the ""win"" (7 vs 8). If I can move that ""is"" one step right, attaching it to the ""win"", then create ""win is you"".
3. To move the ""is"" at 7 right, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is at 2 left, 6 down. The ""is"" at 7 right is much further to the right. So I need to navigate rightward.

But moving from 2 left to 7 right requires moving right 5 steps. However, there are walls at 3 steps right, 4 steps right, etc., which are probably ""STOP"" or ""WALL"" properties. So I need to find a path around them.

Looking at the objects:

- Wall at 3 steps right (maybe at 3,0 if origin is Baba's position).
- Wall at 4 steps right, 1 step down.
- Stop at 2 steps right, 3 steps down.
- Door at 7 steps right, 3 steps down.
- Ball at 7 steps right, 4 steps down.

So moving right directly from my position (2 left, 6 down) towards 7 right would hit walls at 3,4 steps right. Need to find an alternative path, maybe upwards or downwards.

Looking at the map structure, perhaps moving up or down around the walls. For example, moving up from 6 down to 5 down, then right, avoiding the walls.

But without a visual, it's challenging. The key is to reach the ""is"" at 7 right and move it to the ""win"" at 8 right.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" at 2 left is closer. If I can move that one, but I'm not sure where it is.

Given the confusion in coordinates, perhaps the best immediate action is to move right towards the ""is"" at 7 right, step by step, avoiding walls. But the walls are at 3 steps right, so moving right from 2 left (assuming left is negative) to 3 right would hit a wall. So maybe move up first to avoid the walls.

For example:

1. Move up from 6 down to 5 down.
2. Then move right towards the ""is"" at 7 right, but need to navigate around the walls at 3,4 steps right.

Alternatively, move left to the ""is"" at 2 left, pick it up, and then move right. But if the ""is"" is at 2 left, same as Baba's position, then moving left from there would take me away.

This is quite complex. Given the previous failed actions, maybe the assistant needs to try moving in a specific direction that gets closer to the relevant ""is"" rule.

In the current observation, the ""is"" is at 2 step to the left and 1 step up. Wait, no—the objects list shows:

rule `is` 2 step to the left and 1 step up

Wait, no, looking back:

The objects on the map include:

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
...
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up

So there are two ""is"" rules: one at (1 left, 1 up) and another at (7 right, 1 up). The ""win"" is at (8 right, 1 up).

So the ""is"" at 7 right is adjacent to the ""win"" at 8 right. If I can move that ""is"" one step right, it becomes ""win is [something]"".

To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""is"" at 7 right,1 up. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 6 steps down. So coordinates are quite different.

This requires navigating from (2 left, 6 down) to (7 right, 1 up), avoiding walls and stops.

The path would likely involve moving up, then right, but there are walls at 3 steps right, 1 step down, and others. Maybe moving up to 5 down, then right, then up.

Alternatively, this is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best action now is to move right towards the ""is"" at 7 right, step by step, hoping to reach it and then move it to the ""win"".

I need to figure out what action to take here. Let's look at the current observation.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I can manipulate text blocks or interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I should check if there's any rule that changes the win condition. 

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a ""rule `is`"" 3 steps to the left. That might be useful for creating new rules by moving it next to other text blocks.
- The ""win"" object is 7 steps to the right. Directly moving there might be blocked by walls or stops.
- There's a ""ball"" 1 step to the left. Maybe I can use the ball to push something, but the walls are in the way.
- There are several ""wall"" objects, some marked as ""stop,"" which I can't move through.
- The ""door"" is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant yet.
- The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps to the left and 6 steps down, along with another ""is"" and ""you"" rule. Maybe I can combine these to change my properties.

Hmm, my goal is to get to the ""win"" at 7 steps right. But the path there is blocked by walls. The ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 steps down might be stopping me from moving past that area. 

Wait, since I'm ""BABA IS YOU,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable unless they're under a ""stop"" rule. Looking at the map, the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps left is nearby. Maybe I can grab that and move it to combine with other rules.

If I move the ""rule `is`"" block next to the ""win"" object, I could create a new rule like ""win IS YOU,"" making the win condition something I can interact with. Alternatively, if I move it to the ""baba"" rule, maybe I can change ""baba"" to have new properties, like ""baba IS WIN,"" which would make me the win object.

Let me check the positions again. The ""rule `is`"" is 3 steps left of where I am (assuming I'm at the original position, but the exact location isn't specified here). Wait, the current observation lists objects relative to Baba's position? Or are the positions absolute? The previous actions moved Baba around, so probably the positions are relative to Baba's current location.

Wait, in the observation, the ""rule `is`"" is 3 steps to the left. So if I move left three steps, I reach that rule block. Then, if I can move it next to the ""win"" object (7 steps to the right), I can create ""win IS YOU"" by placing ""is"" between them. That would make the win object interactable as me.

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ""baba"" rule (3 steps left and 6 steps down) and combining them might change ""baba"" to ""baba IS WIN,"" making me the win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left to grab the ""rule `is`"" block.
2. Move right to the ""win"" object.
3. Place the ""is"" block between ""BABA"" (or myself) and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But I need to check if there are any ""stop"" rules blocking this path. The ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. If I'm moving right towards the win, I might hit that stop at some point. Maybe I need to find a way around it by moving down or up first.

Alternatively, if I create ""win IS YOU"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""win"" and then ""you,"" that could work. Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe there's a better way.

Another approach: since I'm ""BABA IS YOU,"" maybe I can push the ""ball"" to block a wall or create a path. But the ball is at 1 step left, and there are walls there. Maybe not helpful.

Looking at the other ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps to the right. If I can get there and combine it with ""win"" and ""you,"" that could create ""win IS YOU."" But moving right 6 steps would require passing through several walls and stops. That seems difficult.

Wait, the ""win"" is at 7 steps right. If I can get the ""is"" block there and place it next to ""win"" and ""you,"" that would make the win condition me. But the path is blocked. Maybe I need to use the ball to move a wall out of the way? But the ball is at 1 step left, and the walls are to the right. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""rule IS WIN,"" making the rule block itself a win. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, the ""door"" is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can open the door, maybe that's a path. But doors are usually opened by pushing them with something, but I don't see a key or similar object.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to realize that ""BABA IS YOU"" allows me to move any object unless it's stopped. The ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 steps down means I can't move through that wall. So I need to go around it. Maybe moving down to avoid the stop.

But how does that help reach the win? Let's see the layout:

- Current position: Assume Baba is somewhere. The objects are positioned relative to him.

Looking at the objects:

- ""rule `is`"" 3 steps left: Grab this to create new rules.
- ""win"" 7 steps right: Target.
- ""stop"" at 1 step right, 3 steps down: Blocking path.

If I move left to get the ""is"" block, then move right past the stop. But how? Maybe by moving down first to avoid the stop.

Alternatively, move down to 3 steps down, where there's a ""stop"" rule. Wait, the ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So if I'm at current position, moving down to that spot would hit the stop. So I need to move around it.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move left 3 steps to grab the ""rule `is`"" block.
2. Move right past the stop at 1 step right, 3 steps down. To do this, maybe move down first to avoid the stop's position.

Wait, the stop is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So if I'm at current position, moving right 1 step would put me at the stop's horizontal position, but 3 steps down would be the vertical position. So moving right then down would hit the stop. Alternatively, moving down first then right.

But how does that help? Let's think:

- Current position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0).
- ""rule `is`"" is at (-3, 0).
- ""win"" is at (7, 0).
- ""stop"" is at (1, -3).

So to get from (0,0) to (7,0), I need to go right past (1, -3). If I move down to y=-3 first, then right, I can avoid the stop. But would that path be clear?

Looking at the walls:

- At (4,0), there's a wall.
- At (3, -1), a wall.
- At (3, -2), a wall.
- At (3, -3), a wall.
- At (2, -3), a stop rule (which is a wall you can't move through).

If I move down to y=-3, then right, but there's a stop at (2, -3) and walls at (3, -3). So moving right from (0,0) down to (0, -3), then right to (2, -3) would hit the stop. Not helpful.

Alternative route: Move left to get the ""is"" block, then move up, then right.

From (0,0) to (-3,0) to get the ""is"" block. Then move up to (0,1), then right past the walls.

But looking at the walls:

- At (4,0) is a wall. So moving right from (0,1) would hit the wall at (4,0). Need to find another way.

Alternatively, after getting the ""is"" block at (-3,0), move up to (-3,1), then right to avoid the walls.

But the walls at (3, -1), (3,-2), (3,-3) might complicate things. This is getting too vague without a visual map.

Another angle: The key might be to create a rule that makes the ""win"" interactable. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""win"" a you or make myself win, that would work.

To create ""win IS YOU,"" I need to place ""win"" next to ""is"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at (1, -6) relative to current position (assuming the map's coordinates are based on Baba's location). That's quite far. 

Alternatively, create ""baba IS WIN,"" making Baba the win. Since ""baba is you,"" that would mean you are win.

To do that, I need to get the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

The ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -6) and has an ""is"" at (-2, -6). So if I can move the ""is"" block from (-3,0) to next to the ""baba"" rule's ""is"" at (-2, -6), then create ""baba IS WIN"" by placing ""win"" next to it.

But that would require a long movement. Let's see:

1. Move left 3 steps to get the ""is"" block at (-3,0).
2. Move down 6 steps to reach (-3, -6), which is where the ""baba"" rule is.
3. But there are walls along the way. For example, at (2, -3) there's a stop, and other walls at various positions.

This seems too challenging. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, the ""win"" is at (7,0). If I can push a wall or a stop out of the way to reach it. But I don't have a push action explicitly, but since I'm ""you,"" maybe I can move objects if they're not stopped.

The ""stop"" at (1, -3) is a wall I can't move through. The ""wall"" at (4,0) is also an obstacle. Maybe moving the ""door"" at (7, -3) could help, but I don't see a key.

Alternatively, use the ""ball"" to block a path. The ball is at (-1,0). If I move the ball to (4,0), it might block the wall, but I need to see if that's possible.

But getting to the ball at (-1,0) requires moving left from current position, but the ""rule `is`"" is already there at (-3,0). Maybe not helpful.

Another thought: The ""rule `is`"" at (7,0) (right side). If I can get there and combine it with ""win"" and ""you,"" but the path is blocked by walls.

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps right is at (6,0). The ""win"" is at (7,0). So if I move right 6 steps to get to that ""is"" block, then move right once more to (7,0), place the ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""you,"" but the ""you"" is at (1, -6), which is far away.

This isn't working. Let me try to think differently.

Since ""baba is you,"" and I need to reach ""win,"" perhaps the solution is to create a rule that changes the ""win"" condition to something else I can interact with. For example, ""flag IS WIN"" if there's a flag, but there's no flag here. 

Alternatively, ""rule IS WIN"" making the rule block itself a win. But how?

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you,"" and others. If I can create a new rule like ""rule IS WIN,"" then any rule block would be a win. But I need to have a ""rule"" and ""win"" adjacent with ""is"" in between.

The ""rule `is`"" blocks are at (-3,0) and (6,0). The ""win"" is at (7,0). So if I move the left ""is"" block from (-3,0) to between ""rule"" (which is a text block?) and ""win."" Wait, no. The ""rule `is`"" is a single text block that says ""IS,"" right? Or is it a subject and property? Wait, in Baba Is You, a rule is made by two text blocks: [Subject] and [Property], connected by ""IS."" For example, ""BABA IS YOU"" is composed of ""BABA,"" ""IS,"" and ""YOU."" So the ""rule `is`"" might be just the ""IS"" part, which isn't directly useful unless combined with subject and property.

Ah, right! To create a new rule, you need a subject, ""IS,"" and a property. So the existing ""rule `is`"" is just the ""IS"" part. The ""win"" is an object, and ""you"" is another rule.

So to create ""win IS YOU,"" I need to have ""win,"" ""IS,"" and ""you"" adjacent. The ""IS"" can be taken from the ""rule `is`"" blocks.

In the current observation, there are ""rule `is`"" blocks at 3 steps left and 6 steps right. The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down (1 step left and 6 steps down).

So the plan would be:

1. Grab the ""IS"" block (rule `is`) from either the left or right.
2. Move to the area where ""win"" and ""you"" are located.
3. Place the ""IS"" block between ""win"" and ""you"" to create ""win IS YOU,"" making the win condition interactable as me.

But the problem is the path to the ""win"" at 7 steps right is blocked by walls and a stop. Let's see:

The ""win"" is at (7,0). To get there, I need to move right past (4,0) which is a wall. Unless I can push the wall, but I can't move stopped objects. The ""stop"" is at (1, -3), which is not on the direct path.

Alternatively, use the ""door"" at (7, -3). If I can open the door, maybe by pushing it with the ball or something. But the ball is at (-1,0), which is to the left. To get to the door, I'd have to move right 7 steps, which is blocked by walls.

This is tricky. Maybe another approach: create a rule that makes ""baba"" a ""win."" For that, I need ""baba,"" ""IS,"" and ""win"" adjacent.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -6) with an ""is"" block at (-2, -6). The ""win"" is at (7,0). So if I can move the ""is"" block from, say, the right side (6,0) to next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" but that's a long way.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block from the left (3 steps left) to near the ""baba"" rule. Let's see:

1. Move left 3 steps to get the ""is"" block at (-3,0).
2. Move down 6 steps to (-3, -6), which is where the ""baba"" rule is.
3. Place the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""win"" is far away.

This isn't feasible. Maybe I need to find a different text block to work with.

Wait, there's a ""rule `ball`"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can use the ball to push something. But I'm not sure how.

Another idea: Since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""win"" object if it's not stopped. But ""win"" is an object, not a text block, so I can move it unless there's a ""stop"" on it. Looking at the active rules, there's no ""stop"" on ""win,"" so I can push it.

If I can move the ""win"" object to where I am, that would solve it. But the ""win"" is at 7 steps right. To push it left, I need to be adjacent to it and move left. But the path is blocked by walls at (4,0) and others.

Alternatively, move the walls out of the way. But I can only move objects that aren't stopped. The walls at (4,0) and others are likely stopped or part of the level design.

This is really challenging. Let me recap the possible solution steps:

- The key is to create a rule that makes the win condition interactable as me.
- To do that, create either ""win IS YOU"" or ""baba IS WIN.""
- To create ""win IS YOU,"" need ""win,"" ""IS,"" and ""you"" adjacent.
- The ""you"" rule is at (1, -6), which is far down.
- The ""win"" is at (7,0).
- The ""IS"" blocks are at (-3,0) and (6,0).

The shortest path might be to use the right ""IS"" block at (6,0). If I can move there, then move to the ""win"" at (7,0), but there's a wall at (4,0) blocking the way. Unless I can push that wall, but I can't move stopped objects.

Alternatively, move down from the ""IS"" block at (6,0) to avoid the wall. For example:

1. Move right 6 steps to (6,0) to get the ""IS"" block.
2. Move down to (6, -1), then left to avoid the wall at (4,0).
3. Move left to (0, -1), then up to (0,0), then right to (7,0) past the walls.

But this is speculative without knowing the exact map layout. 

Alternatively, since the ""win","

80,left,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current goal is to reach the WIN object, but the active rules are still ""baba is you"". I need to figure out how to manipulate the rules to get past the walls and stops. Let me look at the map structure.

The player (Baba) is at 3 steps to the left. The WIN is at 7 steps to the right. There's a wall at 2 steps to the right, and further right there's a door at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and a ball at 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. Then there's another wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, and a stop at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. The ball seems important because maybe I can move it or use it to change a rule.

Looking at the rules, there's a rule ""is"" at 3 steps to the left, which I can probably move to create a new rule. If I move the ""is"" text block to combine with ""ball"" or ""door"", maybe I can make ""ball is you"" or ""door is you"". But first, I need to reach the ""is"" block. Currently, the player is at 3 steps left, and the ""is"" block is there, so maybe moving right towards it.

Wait, the player is at 3 steps left. The ""is"" block is also 3 steps left, so maybe the player is on the same position as the ""is"" block? If so, maybe I can pick it up and move it elsewhere. But the player is ""Baba is you"", so they can move other objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, right? So if I move right, I can grab the ""is"" block and take it to, say, the ball or door to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""ball"" would make ""ball is you"", allowing me to push the ball or interact with it.

But how to get to the ball? The ball is at 6 steps right and 4 steps down. The path is blocked by walls and a stop. Maybe I need to first create a rule that allows moving through stops or walls. Alternatively, making ""door is win"" could let me go through the door. But to do that, I need to create that rule. 

Alternatively, maybe making ""stop is nothing"" would make stops passable. But to create that rule, I need to rearrange the existing ""is"" blocks. Let me think step by step.

First, the player is at 3 steps left. The ""is"" rule is there. If I move right, I can pick up the ""is"" block and carry it to another object. Let's say I move right to get to the ""is"" block. Wait, in the observation, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are positioned relative to the player. The ""rule `is` 3 step to the left"" probably means it's three steps to the left of the player's current position. So if the player is at position X, the ""is"" block is at X - 3. The ball is at 1 step to the left of the player, so X - 1. The wall at 2 steps right is X + 2.

So the player is somewhere, and objects are placed relative to them. To move the ""is"" block, I need to move right towards it. Let's see: the player is at their starting position, and the ""is"" block is 3 steps left. Wait, that might mean the player is to the right of the ""is"" block. So to reach the ""is"" block, the player would need to move left three times. But in previous steps, the assistant kept moving right, which might have moved the player towards the right side. Hmm, maybe the player's position is changing as they move.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are absolute. For example, the map has a grid, and each object's position is in grid coordinates. But the problem is that without knowing the player's absolute position, it's tricky. But the observations list objects relative to the player. For example, ""rule `is` 3 step to the left"" means three steps to the left of the player's current position.

So the player's current position is the reference point. To get to the ""is"" block that's 3 steps left, the player needs to move left three times. But in previous steps, the assistant was moving right, perhaps navigating towards other parts of the level. However, in the latest observation, the player is again near the left side with the ""is"" block 3 steps left, ball 1 step left, etc.

Wait, in the current observation, the ""is"" block is 3 steps left of the player, the ball is 1 step left, and the wall is 2 steps right. So the player is somewhere in the middle-left of the map. To pick up the ""is"" block, the player needs to move left three times. But if they move left, they might hit a wall? Let's check the objects around. The wall is 2 steps to the right, so moving left shouldn't hit a wall immediately. The ball is 1 step left, so moving left once would reach the ball, but the ""is"" is three steps left. So the path to the ""is"" block is clear? Or are there other obstacles?

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to rearrange the ""is"" block to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""ball"" would make ""ball is you"", allowing the player to push the ball. Then, push the ball towards the WIN, which is 7 steps right. But the ball is at 6 steps right and 4 steps down. There's a door at 6 steps right and 3 steps down, and a stop at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So moving the ball down might require pushing it through the door, but the door is a rule that's a door. If ""door is win"", then standing on it would win. So perhaps making ""door is win"" would help.

To make ""door is win"", the player needs to move the ""is"" block next to both ""door"" and ""win"". But the current ""is"" block is 3 steps left, and the door is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But ""win"" is at 7 steps right, which is even further.

Another approach: since ""baba is you"", the player can move any object that's not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So objects there are stopped. So the player can't move the wall at 2 steps right directly, but maybe by rearranging rules.

Wait, the rule ""wall"" is at 3 steps left and 1 step down. If the player can create a rule like ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing"", that might help. But to do that, they need to manipulate the ""is"" block.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 3 steps left to a position where it can combine with another object to create a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is you"".

2. Once ""ball is you"", the player can push the ball. Then, push the ball towards the WIN or interact with the door.

Alternatively, create ""door is win"" by moving ""is"" next to door and win.

But how to reach those positions? The player is currently at 3 steps left (position of the ""is"" block), ball is 1 step left, wall is 2 steps right. So moving left towards the ""is"" block (which is already at 3 steps left) – wait, no. If the ""is"" block is 3 steps left of the player, then the player is to the right of the ""is"" block. So to pick up the ""is"" block, the player needs to move left three times. But moving left three steps would place the player at the ""is"" block's location. Then, they can pick it up and carry it elsewhere.

But in the current observation, after moving right multiple times, the player's position might have changed. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the initial position, and the ""is"" block is 3 steps left. Let me clarify:

If the player is at their starting position, and the ""is"" rule is 3 steps left, then moving left three times would reach the ""is"" block. Once there, they can move it to combine with another object.

But in the previous steps, the assistant was moving right, perhaps to reach other parts of the map. However, in the latest observation, the player is back near the left side with the ""is"" block 3 steps left. So maybe the best move is to move left to get the ""is"" block.

But wait, in the current observation, after several failed actions, the player is at a position where moving left would reach the ""is"" block. So the action should be ""left"" to grab the ""is"" block. Then, move it to combine with another object.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to move right to reach the ""win"" object. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop. So creating a rule that removes the stop or makes walls passable is necessary.

Another possibility: make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". ""Baba"" is at 3 steps left and 6 steps down, and ""win"" is at 7 steps right. That's a far distance. Not sure.

Alternatively, create ""you is win"" – but ""you"" is already a rule at 6 steps down. If the player can make ""you is win"", then since the player is you, that would make the player win. But how? The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down in previous observations. Not sure.

Wait, in the current observation, the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. So if the player can create a rule like ""you is win"", then since the player is you, standing on win would make them win. But to create that rule, they need to move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win"".

The ""win"" is at 7 steps right, and ""you"" is at 6 steps down. So the player would need to move the ""is"" block to that area, which is quite far. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, create ""stop is nothing"" by moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and ""nothing"". But ""nothing"" isn't on the map. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Let's recap the current state:

- Active rule: ""baba is you""
- WIN is at 7 steps right
- Ball is at 1 step left (close)
- ""is"" block is 3 steps left (player is to the right of it)
- ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down
- ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps down

Possible actions:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block and carry it to the ball to make ""ball is you"".
2. Move right towards the WIN, but blocked by walls and stop.
3. Move down to the ""you"" rule and ""win"" to create a rule like ""you is win"".
4. Move to the stop and create a rule to remove it.

Option 1 seems promising. If the player moves left to get the ""is"" block, then they can move it next to the ball. But the ball is 1 step left of the player's current position. So moving left once would reach the ball, but the ""is"" block is 3 steps left. Wait, the player's current position is such that the ""is"" block is 3 steps left, the ball is 1 step left. So the player is two steps to the right of the ball. So moving left once would reach the ball, but the ""is"" is three steps left. So the player is between the ""is"" block and the ball.

So the player needs to move left three steps to reach the ""is"" block, then perhaps move left again to reach the ball. But after picking up the ""is"" block, moving it left to the ball's location (which is now one step left of the original position) would create ""ball is you"".

Once ""ball is you"", the player can push the ball. The ball is at 1 step left (player's current position after moving left). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing without the exact grid layout.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of relative movements. The player is at position X. The ""is"" block is at X - 3. The ball is at X - 1. The wall is at X + 2. The WIN is at X + 7.

To get the ""is"" block, move left three times to reach X - 3. Once there, pick up the ""is"" block and move left again to X - 4 (which is X - 1, the ball's position). Place the ""is"" block next to the ball. Now the rule becomes ""ball is you"". Then, the player (as you) can move the ball. Push the ball towards the WIN. The ball is at X - 1, need to move it to X + 7. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop. The stop is at X + 2 and X + 3 steps down. So pushing the ball right would hit the wall at X + 2. Unless there's a way to remove the wall or stop.

Alternatively, create a rule to make the wall passable. For example, ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing"". To do that, move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and another property. But the ""wall"" rule is at X - 3 and 1 step down. So the player would need to move the ""is"" block there. But the player is currently at X - 3 (after picking up the ""is"" block). So place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and, say, ""push"", but ""push"" isn't on the map. Alternatively, ""wall is you"" – but that would make walls controllable by the player.

Alternatively, create ""stop is nothing"" by moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and ""nothing"". But ""nothing"" isn't present. So that's not possible.

Another angle: since the player is ""Baba is you"", they can move any non-stopped object. The ""stop"" rule is at X + 2 and 3 steps down. So objects there are stopped. The wall at X + 2 is a wall, which by default is stopped. So the player can't move it directly. But if the player can create a rule like ""wall is push"", then the wall becomes pushable.

To make ""wall is push"", the player needs to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""push"". But ""push"" isn't a rule on the map. So they would have to create a new rule ""push is ..."" which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, create ""baba is push"", making the player able to push objects. But ""baba is you"" is already active, and ""baba is push"" would override it. Not sure if that's useful.

Wait, the initial rule is ""baba is you"". If the player creates ""baba is push"", then the player becomes pushable, which might not help. Alternatively, create ""you is push"", but ""you"" is already a rule.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to focus on the immediate actions. The player needs to get the ""is"" block to manipulate rules. The closest ""is"" block is 3 steps left. Moving left three times would get to it. Once there, the player can pick it up and carry it to another object.

So the next action should be ""left"" to move towards the ""is"" block. Then, after grabbing it, move left again to reach the ball and create ""ball is you"". Then, push the ball towards the WIN.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the win object. Looking at the active rules, it says ""baba is you,"" so I'm Baba. The win is 8 steps to the right. There are walls blocking the direct path. The rules also include ""wall"" 3 steps to the right and some down, but I need to figure out how to navigate around them.

First, where am I currently? The objects list shows that I have a rule `is` 2 steps to the left. Wait, Baba is me, so maybe my position is at that rule `is`? Or is the rule `is` separate? Hmm, not sure. Let's assume the rule `is` 2 steps to the left is a text block that can be moved. The ball is 1 step to the left of that, so maybe I'm next to the ball? Or perhaps the positions are relative to each other.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" or something like that, then touching the win object would work. But right now, the active rules only have ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around but can't push things unless they have specific properties.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `win` at 8 steps right. Directly there are walls (3 steps right, 2 steps right and 1 down, etc.), and a stop at 2 steps right and 3 down. So path is blocked. Maybe I need to use the ball? But the ball is 6 steps right and 4 steps down. Not sure.

Alternatively, if I can make ""WIN IS YOU"" or ""BABA IS WIN,"" but how? The current rules include ""baba is you"" and other rules like ""wall is..."", ""stop is..."", etc. To create a new rule, I need to move the `is` text block next to the subject and property.

The `is` text block is 2 steps to the left. If I move right towards it, maybe I can pick it up and then place it next to ""win"" and ""you"" or ""baba"" and ""win"". For example, if I take the `is` block and place it between ""baba"" and ""win"", making ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would make me win. But how to get there?

Current position: Assuming the `is` block is 2 steps left of me, so I'm to the right of that. If I move right, I can reach the `is` block. Then move it to where? The ""you"" rule is 6 steps down. If I can place `is` between ""baba"" and ""win"", that would change the rules. But to do that, I need to navigate to the position where those objects are.

Looking at the objects: ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps left and 6 steps down. The `is` block is at 2 steps left and 6 steps down. The `you` rule is at 6 steps down. So if I move down to that area, maybe I can rearrange the `is` block. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 5 steps down, and the stop at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. So movement might be restricted.

Alternatively, maybe pushing the ball towards the win? But since I'm Baba and the ball's rule is ""rule `ball` 6 steps right..."", unless I can change the ball's properties. If I can make ""BALL IS PUSH"" or something, but that requires modifying rules. But the current rules don't have that.

Another approach: If I can make ""WIN IS YOU"", then touching the win object would work. To do that, I need to move the `is` block next to ""win"" and ""you"". The ""you"" is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right. So moving the `is` block to connect them might be tricky due to the layout.

Alternatively, check if there's a door at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe using the door requires a key, but there's no key mentioned. Or maybe the door is a way through if I can move it, but doors are usually passable unless stopped.

Wait, the active rules have ""rule `win` 8 steps to the right"". So the win is an object. To win, I need to touch it. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop. The stop at 2 steps right and 3 steps down might be an immovable object. So maybe need to find a way around.

Looking at the positions again:

- My position: Assuming I'm at the `baba` rule? Or where is Baba located? The objects include ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"", but that's a text block. The player is Baba, so perhaps I'm next to that? Not sure. Maybe the initial position is somewhere else. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move the `is` block to make ""BABA IS WIN"". Let's see:

- The `is` block is 2 steps to the left. If I move right to get to it, then take it and move down to the `baba` rule which is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the `is` block at 2 steps left and 1 step up. Maybe I'm near there.

This is tricky without knowing the exact layout. But based on previous steps, the assistant has been moving left and right. Maybe the correct action here is to move left towards the `is` block to pick it up and then rearrange the rules. Or perhaps move down to the area where `baba`, `is`, and `you` are located to create a new rule like ""baba is win"".

Another possibility: The ""door"" at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move past the stop at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, maybe by changing the stop's property. But the stop is a rule, so if I can make ""STOP IS NOTHING"", then it wouldn't block. But that requires creating a new rule.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push objects that are pushable. But the current rules don't specify push, unless ""wall is push"" or something. But walls here are likely immovable because of ""stop"" or other rules.

Wait, the rules include ""rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"". So any object with ""stop"" property is immovable. The stop is at that position, so maybe moving around it by going up or down.

But the path to the win (8 steps right) is blocked by walls and the stop. Maybe need to go around via different directions. For example, move down to avoid the stop and walls, then head right. But the layout of walls is such that moving down might lead to more walls.

Alternatively, use the ball. If I can move the ball towards the win, but how? If the ball is pushable, but the rules don't say ""ball is push"". Unless I can change the rule to make ball pushable.

But to do that, I need to move the `is` block to make ""BALL IS PUSH"". Then I could push the ball into the win. But the ball is at 6 steps right and 4 steps down. To get there, I need to navigate past walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move the `is` block to make ""BABA IS WIN"". Let's try that.

Current `is` block is at 2 steps left. If I move right twice to get to it, then take it. Then move down to the `baba` rule which is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down. Wait, that might not align. Alternatively, move the `is` block to the position of `baba` and `win`.

But the `win` is 8 steps to the right, which is far away. Maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, the `you` rule is at 6 steps down. If I can make ""WIN IS YOU"", then touching win would work. To do that, move the `is` block between `win` and `you`. The `win` is at 8 steps right, `you` is at 6 steps down. That's a diagonal distance, so maybe not possible to move the `is` block there directly.

Hmm. Maybe I need to find a way to reach the `win` object by rearranging rules. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", perhaps I can move the `win` text block? But the rules are fixed unless moved. The `win` rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. To move it, I need to pick it up and place it elsewhere. But can I move it? The rules don't specify any restrictions on moving text blocks, except that they can't be stopped. Since ""win"" isn't defined as stop, maybe I can move it.

If I can move the `win` block next to me, then touching it would win. But how to get there. The path is blocked by walls and a stop. Maybe go around the stop by moving up or down.

The stop is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move around it, perhaps by going up to 2 steps right and 2 steps down, then right to 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a wall. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move left from the stop's position. But I'm not sure of the exact layout.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the `is` block to create a new rule. Let's try moving right twice to get to the `is` block at 2 steps left, then pick it up and move down to the `baba` rule at 3 steps left and 5 steps down, placing the `is` there to make ""baba is win"". That could work.

So the sequence would be: right, right (to reach the `is` block), then down multiple times to reach the `baba` rule area, then place the `is` next to `baba` and `win`. But how to command that in a single action? The system requires choosing one action at a time.

Given the current observation, the `is` block is 2 steps to the left. Wait, the observation says ""rule `is` 2 step to the left"". So if I'm facing left, moving left would take me to it. But where am I positioned? Maybe I'm next to the `is` block. If so, moving left would pick it up. Then move down to the `baba` rule.

But the assistant's previous actions have been left, right, up, etc., so maybe the correct action here is to move left to get to the `is` block, then rearrange the rules. But in the current observation, the `is` block is 2 steps to the left. So if I'm one step right of it, moving left would reach it. Then, after picking it up, move down to the `baba` rule at 3 steps left and 5 steps down.

So the next action should be left to get to the `is` block.

82,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right. But let me check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" at 9 steps right. To get there, there's a wall at 4 steps right, another at 8 steps right, and the path seems blocked by walls and stops. But maybe I can manipulate the rules to bypass obstacles.

There's a rule ""is"" 1 step to the left. If I can move that ""is"" rule to combine with other text blocks, maybe I can create new rules. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"" or ""baba is win,"" that could change things. But first, I need to see if I can pick up the ""is"" rule.

Check if I can move. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move unless stopped. The walls are at 4 steps right and others, but I'm currently at the position of ""rule `is` 1 step to the left."" Wait, where is Baba located? The rule ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. So I'm at (1 left, 6 down). The ""win"" is at 9 right, so I need to go right.

But the path to the right is blocked by walls and a stop at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. Maybe moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For instance, if I move ""is"" next to ""ball,"" could I make ""ball is win""? Then touching the ball would make it a win. Alternatively, making ""baba is win"" would make me the win.

Wait, there's a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 6 steps down, which is where the ""you"" text block is. Maybe I need to combine ""baba"" with ""you"" and ""win."" But right now, the active rule is just ""baba is you.""

Looking at the objects, the closest movable text block is the ""is"" rule 1 step to the left. If I move left from my current position (1 left, 6 down) to get that ""is"" rule, I can then move it elsewhere. Let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So maybe my position is at (1 left, 6 down). The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left, which would be at (0 left, 6 down)? Or is it relative? This might be confusing with the coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps all objects are positioned relative to Baba's location.

Assuming that the ""is"" rule is adjacent, moving left from Baba's position would get to that ""is"" rule. Once grabbed, I can move it to combine with other text blocks. For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" at 9 steps right to make ""win is ..."". But where is the ""win"" located? It's 7 steps to the right and 1 step up from the initial ""is"" rule. Hmm, maybe the coordinates are absolute.

Alternatively, the game might use a grid where each direction is relative. The key is to find a way to create a rule that allows reaching the win. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they are stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe if I can remove the ""stop"" property or make it passable.

Another approach: If I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is not stop"" by rearranging, but I need the ""is"" rule to do that. Let's see. The existing rules are ""baba is you,"" and there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered. If I can move an ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop,"" maybe change their properties. But the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 3 down. To reach there, I need to navigate past walls, which is tricky.

Alternatively, focus on the ""ball"" at 7 steps right and 4 down. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it a win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 8 steps right, 1 step up. So moving the ""is"" between ""ball"" and ""win"" would create ""ball is win.""

But how to get there? From my current position (1 left, 6 down), moving right towards the ball area. There's a wall at 4 steps right, so maybe I need to push it? But I can't push unless I'm defined as pushable, which I am since ""baba is you."" Wait, can I push walls? Normally, in Baba Is You, you can push boxes unless they're stopped. But walls are usually immovable unless a rule says otherwise. Since there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 right, 3 down, perhaps pushing the wall at 4 right is possible if it's not stopped.

Wait, the wall at 4 steps right is just a regular wall. To push it, I need to move into it while being able to push. But since I'm Baba (you), and walls are normally stop, maybe I can't push them. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing. But the only active rule is ""baba is you."" So maybe I can't push walls. That complicates things.

Alternatively, find a way to remove the ""stop"" property from the stop block. If I can make ""stop is nothing"" or something, but that requires manipulating the existing rules. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 3 down. To reach there, I need to navigate past walls. From my current position (1 left, 6 down), moving right towards the stop block would involve going through walls at 3 steps right and others. Not sure if possible.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can open the door, but I don't know if there's a key or rule for that. The rules don't mention door interaction beyond existing properties.

Wait, the ""door"" might be passable if there's a rule allowing it. But unless there's a ""door is you"" or similar, I might need to push past it. But again, walls are blocking the path.

Let me recap. My goal is to reach the ""win"" at 9 steps right. Obstacles: walls at 4, 8 steps right; stop at 3 right, 3 down. Possible solutions:

1. Create a rule that makes the path clear, like ""wall is nothing"" or ""stop is nothing.""
2. Make myself (Baba) a win by creating ""baba is win.""
3. Make the ball a win by creating ""ball is win"" and then reach it.
4. Push walls or stops out of the way if possible.

To create ""baba is win,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 down, and the ""win"" is at 9 right. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position (1 left) to between ""baba"" and ""win."" But how to get there?

From my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location), moving right towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step left (which is adjacent?), then grab that ""is"" and move it to the ""win"" location. Wait, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left of Baba. So if I move left, I can pick up the ""is"" rule. Then move right with it towards the ""win.""

Let me check the coordinates again. If ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 6 down, and the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left, that would place the ""is"" rule at 2 steps left of the original position? Or is it relative? This is a bit confusing. Maybe the coordinate system is such that each object's position is relative to the starting point.

Alternatively, think of the map as a grid where each direction moves you one cell. The key is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the desired rule.

So steps:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" rule (since it's 1 step to the left of Baba).
2. Move right, carrying the ""is"" rule, to the ""win"" location (9 steps right).
3. Place the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win,"" making myself the win.

But the problem is navigating past the walls. From my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location), moving left takes me to the ""is"" rule. Then moving right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. How to get past that?

Unless I can push the wall. Since I'm Baba (you), and walls are normally stop, but maybe if there's a rule allowing pushing. But the only active rule is ""baba is you."" So I can't push walls. This is a problem.

Alternative path: Use the ""ball"" to reach the win. If I can make the ball a win by creating ""ball is win,"" then go to the ball. The ball is at 7 steps right and 4 down. To get there, I need to move right past the wall at 4 steps right. Again, stuck.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to remove the wall's stop property. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is not stop"" by rearranging. But that would require changing an existing rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and change its property. For instance, moving ""is"" to make ""wall is you,"" but that might not help.

Alternatively, destroy the ""wall is stop"" rule. But in Baba Is You, you can't destroy rules; you can only move them. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the wall might no longer be stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can grab it and move it elsewhere, the wall at 4 steps right might become pushable or passable.

But how to reach the ""stop"" rule? From my current position, moving right 2 steps would get to the ""stop"" rule's x-coordinate, but I have to navigate around the walls. The path would be:

Current position: 1 left, 6 down.

To get to stop at 2 right, 3 down:

Need to move right to 2 steps right (passing through walls at 3,4 steps right?), but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe this path is blocked.

This is getting complicated. Let's think differently. Since the latest observation has the ""is"" rule at 1 step to the left, and I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location, maybe the best move is to grab that ""is"" rule and move it towards the ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

So actions would be:

1. Move left to pickup the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right multiple times to reach the ""win"" location.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But in the current observations, after some previous actions, the ""is"" rule is now at 1 step to the left. So from Baba's position (1 left, 6 down), moving left would take me to the ""is"" rule. Then, moving right towards the ""win"" at 9 steps right.

However, there's a wall at 4 steps right. If I can push it, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the wall is no longer there if a rule changes it. But without modifying rules, it's a block.

Wait, maybe the wall at 4 steps right is part of a different rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So that's a separate wall. The wall at 4 steps right might be a static wall.

Another idea: Use the ""ball"" to reach the win. If I can push the ball past the walls. The ball is at 7 steps right, 4 down. To push it right towards the win at 8 steps right, but there's a wall at 8 steps right. Unless I can make the wall passable.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then I could push it. But that requires creating ""wall is you"" rule. To do that, I need to move an ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""you."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. So from my current position, moving right to 1 step right (to the ""you"" rule), then moving down to reach the ""wall"" at 2 left, 1 down. But this seems tricky.

Maybe the simplest way is to focus on making ""baba is win."" So:

- Move left to grab the ""is"" rule.
- Move right, avoiding obstacles (but stuck by walls).
- If I can't avoid, maybe the level requires a different approach.

Wait, in the current observation, after several moves, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left, and the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 down. So perhaps I'm at the ""baba"" position, which is 1 left, 6 down. The ""is"" is adjacent to me on the left. So moving left once would pick it up.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, I need to move it to the ""win"" location. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right. From my current position (1 left, 6 down), moving right 8 steps would get to the win. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. Unless I can push it, which I can't, this path is blocked.

Alternatively, is there a way to use the door? The door is at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can open it by creating a rule like ""door is open,"" but there's no such text block. The rules only have ""door"" as a property.

Another angle: The ""ball"" is at 7 steps right, 4 down. If I can make the ball a win by creating ""ball is win,"" then go to the ball. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

The ""ball"" is at 7 right, 4 down. The ""win"" is at 8 right, 1 up. So moving the ""is"" from 1 left to between ""ball"" and ""win"" would require navigating from my current position to the ball's area.

Path from 1 left, 6 down to 7 right, 4 down:

Right, right, right, right (4 times to x=5), then down three steps. But there are walls at 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; etc. So this path is blocked.

Hmm. This is really tricky. Maybe I need to look for a different strategy. Let's see the objects again:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left
- ball 1 step to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is at 1 left, 1 down. That's a text block defining a wall. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, maybe I can remove the wall property. For example, moving it away so that the wall at 4 right, 1 down is no longer defined as a wall. But the wall itself is a separate object; the text block ""rule `wall`"" is what defines it. So if I can move the ""wall"" rule away, the wall object might become non-existent or change property.

But how? The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 down. To move it, I need to be adjacent and take it. From my position (1 left, 6 down), moving down to 1 left, 1 down would reach the ""wall"" rule. Then pick it up and move it elsewhere. For example, move it to the right, making the wall at 4 right, 1 down no longer a wall. But this is a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Given that the ""is"" is 1 step to the left of Baba, moving left to grab it, then moving right towards the ""win."" But the path is blocked.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to push the wall at 4 steps right. If I can make the wall passable. For example, if I can create ""wall is you,"" then I could push it. But that requires creating a new rule. Let's see:

If I move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" (at 1 left, 1 down) and ""you"" (at 1 right, 6 down), but that's a long way. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to where the ""wall"" object is, but they are separate.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" Even if the path is blocked, maybe the game allows it by changing the rules first.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move left to pick up the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right towards the ""win"" at 9 steps right.
3. Place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

But physically moving there is impossible due to walls. Unless the walls are no longer there because their defining rules are moved.

Wait, the wall at 4 steps right is defined by the ""rule `wall`"" at 1 left, 1 down. If I can move that ""rule `wall`"" away, the wall object at 4 right, 1 down might become non-existent or change. For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule to the right, then the wall at 4 right might no longer be there.

I notice that there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. The closest ""is"" is 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to combine with other text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""ball is win,"" that would change the goal. Alternatively, making ""you"" a different object like ""ball"" could let me push the ball to the win spot.

Looking at the positions, the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step to the right. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" again, but it seems the current rule is already ""baba is you."" Wait, no, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so that's correct. But maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to attach to ""ball,"" making ""ball is you."" Then I could move the ball to the win spot.

To do that, I need to pick up the ""you"" rule (1 step right, 6 steps down) and move it next to the ""ball"" (1 step right). But first, I have to move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step to the left. If I move that ""is"" to the left again, but it's already at the minimum position. Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule to attach to ""ball"" and ""you."" For instance, moving the ""is"" to the right next to ""ball"" and then placing ""you"" there to make ""ball is you.""

The problem is that some objects are behind walls or stop blocks. The path to the right is blocked by walls and a stop rule at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. So moving directly right might not work. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules first. If I can create a rule like ""wall is stop"" or ""stop is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" object here.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can push objects, maybe push the ball towards the win spot. But the ball is 1 step right, and the win is 9 steps right. There are walls blocking the path, so pushing the ball directly isn't feasible. Maybe rearrange the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or ""stop is destroy,"" but that requires modifying existing rules.

Looking at the available text blocks: ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball."" The ""is"" rule is key. If I move the ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" I could make ""ball is win."" Then touching the ball would make it the win condition. Alternatively, make ""you"" into ""door"" so stepping on the door wins.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule that's 1 step to the left closer to the ball (1 step right, 1 step up). Wait, the positions are a bit confusing. Let me visualize the map based on the observation:

- ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left and current position. The ball is 1 step to the right. So the ""is"" is left of the ball. If I move the ""is"" to the right, next to the ball, then place the ""you"" rule there to make ""ball is you."" That way, I become the ball and can push it.

But how to move the ""is"" rule? The action would be to move right towards the ball. However, there's a wall 4 steps to the right, which is blocking the path. So maybe first need to rearrange other rules.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 1 step left to create a new rule. If I move the ""is"" to the left again, but it's already at the leftmost position. Maybe move it down to attach to ""you"" at 6 steps down. So moving the ""is"" down 5 steps to reach the ""you"" rule, then combining them to make ""you is ..."", but not sure.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step to the right. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left. So to get the ""is"" next to ""you,"" I need to move the ""is"" right 2 steps and down 5 steps. That might be possible. Once adjacent, I could make ""you is something,"" but what? If I can make ""you is win,"" then stepping on win would work. But the ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right, which is far away.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is at 1 step left, 6 steps down. The ""win"" is 9 steps right, 1 step up. That's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

Another idea: Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. If I can push the ""win"" rule closer, but it's 9 steps right, blocked by walls. Alternatively, make a rule like ""wall is push"" so I can push walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to create ""wall is push"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""push."" However, there's no ""push"" rule here. The existing rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball.""

Wait, the available text blocks are the ones listed. So maybe ""stop"" is an immovable property. To remove a ""stop"" property, I could create a rule like ""stop is nothing,"" but I don't have a ""nothing"" object. Alternatively, make ""stop is not stop"" by rearranging, but that's not possible in the game mechanics as far as I know.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""stop"" movable. For example, ""stop is you,"" but ""you"" is already assigned to Baba. If I can make ""you"" into ""stop,"" then I could move the stop blocks. Let's see:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""you."" So ""stop is you."" Now, if ""you"" is stop, then I can push stop blocks. But then, since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can push stops. Then push the stop block out of the way to access the path to the right.

But how to rearrange the ""is"" rule to do that. The current ""is"" is at 1 step left. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. So moving the ""is"" from 1 step left to 2 steps right and 3 steps down (the stop position), then next to ""you"" at 6 steps down. This might be a multi-step process.

Alternatively, focus on making the ball the win condition. If I can create ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win. To do that, move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win."" The ball is 1 step right, and the win is 9 steps right. So I need to move the ""is"" from 1 step left to somewhere between ball and win. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop at 3 steps right, 3 steps down.

Maybe first eliminate the stop block. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" but no ""nothing."" Alternatively, push the stop block away. But to push it, I need to be able to move it, which requires changing its property. If I make ""stop is push,"" then I can push it. But to create ""stop is push,"" I need an ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""push."" However, there's no ""push"" text block. The available ones are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball.""

This is tricky. Alternatively, use the existing ""door"" rule. If I can make ""door is win,"" then stepping on the door would win. The door is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. To do that, move the ""is"" next to door and win. But the win is 9 steps right, so moving the ""is"" from its current position (1 step left) all the way to 9 steps right would take many moves, and the path is blocked.

Another angle: Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can push the ""win"" rule itself. If the win rule is a movable object, then pushing it to me would make me the win. But by default, rules are immovable unless specified. The ""win"" rule is likely a text block that's part of the level's static rules, so it's probably immovable. So pushing it won't work.

Wait, the observation says ""Objects on the map"" include the rules. So rules are objects that can be moved, except those defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The initial rule ""baba is you"" means that unless something is STOP, I can move text blocks. So the ""is"" rules, ""win,"" ""wall,"" etc., can be moved unless they're under a STOP rule.

Looking at the current map, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. So any text block placed there or adjacent might be stopped. But the ""is"" rules are movable unless under STOP. So I can move the ""is"" rules around.

Back to the idea of making ""ball is win."" The ball is at 1 step right, and win is at 9 steps right. If I can move the ""is"" rule from 1 step left to between ball and win, then attach ""ball"" and ""win"" with ""is."" But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. Maybe push the walls out of the way by changing their properties.

For example, make ""wall is push,"" then push the walls to the side. But to create ""wall is push,"" I need to move an ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""push."" There's no ""push"" text block, so that's not possible.

Alternative plan: Create a rule that makes walls passable. Like ""wall is you,"" but I'm already you. If I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become you, meaning I can move through them. But that would require placing ""wall is you"" rule. Let's see:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" (which is at 2 step left and 1 step down, and others at 4 steps right, etc.).
2. Then place ""you"" next to it to make ""wall is you.""

But the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. So moving the ""is"" from 1 step left to near the wall, then moving ""you"" there. This might be possible.

Let's visualize the steps:

- Current ""is"" is at 1 step left.
- Move ""is"" down to reach the wall at 2 step left, 1 step down. So move down 1 step.
- Then move right to be next to the wall. But the wall is at 2 step left and 1 step down. Wait, the positions are a bit unclear. The initial ""is"" is 1 step to the left and current position. Maybe coordinate system is relative to Baba's position, which isn't specified, but the observations give absolute positions relative to the map.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the immediate vicinity. The closest ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left. The ball is 1 step to the right. If I can move the ""is"" to the right next to the ball, then attach the ""you"" rule to make ""ball is you."" That way, I become the ball and can push it.

To do that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from 1 step left to the right, adjacent to the ball (1 step right). So action: right.
2. Then, move the ""you"" rule (which is 1 step right, 6 steps down) to be next to the ""is"" and ""ball."" But that would require moving the ""you"" rule up and left, which might be possible if there's no STOP blocking.

However, the path to move the ""you"" rule might be blocked. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right, 3 steps down. So moving up from the ""you"" position (6 steps down) would avoid the stop block.

Once ""ball is you"" is created, I can push the ball towards the win spot at 9 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe after becoming the ball, I can move through walls since ""ball is you,"" but in Baba Is You, typically, if you're a ball, you can still be stopped by STOP rules unless the rule says otherwise. So this might not work.

Alternatively, after making ""ball is you,"" push the ball against a wall to see if it moves. If walls are still stopping me, then this approach won't work. Maybe need to adjust other rules.

Another idea: Make ""you"" into ""door,"" so stepping on the door wins. The door is at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can create ""door is win,"" then touching the door would make it the win. But to do that, move the ""is"" next to door and win. The win is at 9 steps right, so I need to move the ""is"" from 1 step left all the way to 9 steps right, which is impractical due to walls.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to baba and win. But baba is at 1 step left, 6 steps down, and win is at 9 steps right, 1 step up. The distance is too great, and the path is blocked.

This is really challenging. Let's recap:

- I'm Baba, can move and push objects.
- Current rules: baba is you.
- Objects: ball, walls, stops, door, win.
- Need to reach win, but it's blocked.
- Possible solutions: Change win to ball, become ball, push it; change stop to passable; make door the win.

Given the time I've spent, maybe the best immediate action is to try to make the ball the win by moving the ""is"" rule next to ball and win. But the distance is too far. Alternatively, focus on local interactions.

The closest ""is"" is 1 step left. The ball is 1 step right. If I move the ""is"" right once, then place ""you"" there to make ""ball is you."" Let's attempt that:

Action: right (move the ""is"" rule to the right, adjacent to ball)
Then, action: right again to be next to ball and ""you""?
Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. So after moving the ""is"" right once, it's next to the ball (1 step right). Then, move the ""you"" rule up and left to be adjacent to the ""is"" and ""ball."" But the ""you"" is 5 steps down from the current ""is"" position. This seems complex.

Alternatively, since the last few actions led to the ""is"" being at 2 step left, maybe move it further left or right. But I'm not sure.

Another observation: The ""win"" rule is 9 steps to the right. If I could move the ""win"" rule towards me, but it's likely STOPped. Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""win"" movable. For example, ""win is push."" But to do that, need to move ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""push."" No ""push"" exists.

Wait, the available text blocks are: is, win, wall, stop, door, ball. So ""push"" isn't present. Maybe ""move"" is not a property here.

Alternatively, use ""door"" as a win by making ""door is win."" Then go to the door. The door is at 7 steps right, 3 steps down. How to reach it?

Path to door: From current position (assuming Baba is somewhere), but the exact position isn't given. The observations list objects' positions relative to the map, but without Baba's position, it's hard to navigate. However, the actions are relative to Baba's current position. For example, ""up"" would move Baba up one step.

Assuming Baba's position is such that moving right towards the door is possible, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. If I can make the wall passable, then proceed.

To make the wall passable, create ""wall is you."" But I'm already you. So if I make ""wall is you,"" then walls become you, meaning I can move through them. Let's try that:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to a wall. For example, the wall at 2 step left and 1 step down.
2. Then place ""you"" next to it to create ""wall is you.""

But the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. Moving the ""is"" from 1 step left to 2 step left, 1 step down (adjacent to the wall), then move the ""you"" rule up and left to be adjacent. This would require several moves, but possible.

Once ""wall is you"" is active, I can walk through walls. Then go to the door at 7 steps right, 3 steps down, push through walls, and reach the door to win.

Alternatively, after making ""wall is you,"" go to the door and step on it, since the active rule would still be ""win"" at 9 steps right. Wait, no, the door is a separate object. If the door is a separate object, stepping on it wouldn't make you win unless there's a rule ""door is win.""

So to make the door win, create ""door is win"" rule:

1. Move ""is"" next to door (7 steps right, 3 steps down) and win (9 steps right, 1 step up). But the distance is too far.

Alternative approach: Since the ""win"" is far away, maybe the intended solution is to push the ""win"" rule closer. But win rules are likely immovable.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, perhaps the correct action now is to move the ""is"" rule to the left again, but it's already at the leftmost. Alternatively,","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: idle

rule `you` 1 step to the right and 6 steps down
wall 4 steps to the right and 6 steps down",0,False
84,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but right now, I need to check if that's still the case. The active rules show ""baba is you,"" so I'm controlling Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, the ""win"" is 9 steps to the right. There's also a ""ball"" at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps down, and a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. There are walls and stop blocks that might be blocking the path.

First, I need to see where I am. The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left. Since Baba is linked to the ""is"" rule via ""baba is you,"" maybe Baba is positioned at that rule's location? Or perhaps the ""rule `is`"" is separate. Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" and ""ball 1 step to the right."" So if I'm controlling Baba, I might be at the position of the ""rule `is`"" block, which is 1 step to the left. But I need to confirm.

The goal is to reach ""win"" at 9 steps right. To get there, I need to move right past several walls. There's a wall at 4 steps right, and another at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. The ""stop"" block is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which makes that area immovable. The door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe pushing the door? But I need to see if I can move the door or if it's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change the rules. Since I can move text blocks that aren't STOP, I could pick up the ""is"" rule and rearrange the rules. For example, changing ""baba is you"" to something else. But right now, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so I'm still controlling Baba.

Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down,"" along with ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 6 steps down."" Maybe I need to go down to those rules to modify them. If I can reach the ""you"" rule, maybe I can change it to something else, like ""you is win,"" making the win condition a different object, or even making Baba the win.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But how to do that? I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's see. The current ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right. So moving right multiple times to get to the ""win"" and the ""is"" rule, then pushing them together.

But there's a wall at 4 steps right, and a stop block at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So moving right directly might be blocked. Maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, find a way to push the door or another object out of the way. The door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move it, perhaps I can create a path.

Wait, the door is a rule, ""rule `door` 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" If I can move that door block, maybe I can remove it from the path. But doors are usually movable unless there's a STOP rule. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, so that area is blocked. But the door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move the door, maybe I can place it elsewhere to clear a path.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes the ball the win condition. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. The ball is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. So I need to get to that area. But the way there is blocked by walls and the stop block.

Another approach: If I can make ""baba is win,"" then wherever I go, I win. But how? I need to have the ""win"" rule attached to Baba. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I need to replace that with ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down, and the ""win"" is at 9 steps right. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position (1 step left) to between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba, and the rules are ""baba is you,"" I can move the ""is"" rule block if it's not stopped. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left. If I move left from my current position (which is probably at the ""is"" rule's location), I can pick it up and move it. Wait, but the initial position might be where the ""baba"" text block is. The objects include ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" Maybe that's where I am.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine my current position. It's likely near the ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" or the ""baba"" rule block.

2. The immediate goal is to reach the ""win"" at 9 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop block.

3. Alternative plan: Change the rules to make touching the ball or door win, or make Baba itself the win condition.

4. To change rules, I need to move the ""is"" rule to combine with other rules. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

So, the steps would be:

- Move from current position to the ""baba"" rule block (1 step left and 6 steps down).

- Pick up the ""is"" rule and move it towards the ""win"" object.

But the problem is navigating through the map. There's a wall at 4 steps right, and the stop block at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to go around by moving down or up.

Alternatively, move the ""door"" rule out of the way. If I can move the door, perhaps I can remove it from the path to the win.

But how to move the door? The door is a rule block, so as long as it's not stopped, I can move it. The ""stop"" block is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is a different location. So the door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down can be moved.

If I can move the door, maybe I can place it somewhere else to create a path. For example, moving it to the left to clear the path to the win.

But getting to the door requires navigating through the map. Let's see:

Current position (assuming I'm at the ""rule `is` 1 step to the left""):

- To reach the door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, I need to move right 7 times and down 2 times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and a stop block at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So moving directly right is blocked.

Alternative path: Maybe move down first, then right around the wall. For example, move down from the current position (which is 1 step left), then right past the wall. But the exact layout isn't clear. The walls are at 4 steps right, 1 step left and 1 step down, etc. This is tricky without a visual map.

Another idea: Use the ball. If I can make the ball the win condition by creating ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball at 8 steps right and 4 steps down would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""ball"" and ""win.""

So steps:

1. Move to the ""ball"" location (8 steps right, 4 steps down).

2. Bring the ""is"" rule there and combine it with ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win.""

But again, navigating through obstacles is the challenge.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down, and ""win"" is at 9 steps right. So I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position (1 step left) to between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But how to get there? Moving right from the current ""is"" position (1 step left) would require passing through walls. Maybe move down first, then right.

For example:

- From current position (1 step left), move down to avoid the wall at 4 steps right.

- Then move right past the walls. But the wall at 4 steps right is a problem. Unless there's a way to push it or remove it.

Alternatively, use the door to create a passage. If I move the door out of the way, perhaps I can open a path.

This is getting quite complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" Let's try to figure out the steps:

1. Current ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left (assuming that's my position).

2. Move the ""is"" rule down to the area where ""baba"" is located (1 step left and 6 steps down).

3. Once there, move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" object at 9 steps right.

But how to navigate there? There are multiple walls and stop blocks. Maybe the key is to move down first to avoid obstacles.

Alternatively, since the ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 6 steps down, maybe combining ""baba"" with ""you"" and then changing the property.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I'm controlling Baba. The ""you"" rule is separate. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would create ""baba is win.""

So the plan is:

- Move to the location of the ""baba"" rule (1 step left and 6 steps down).

- Pick up the ""is"" rule (which is currently 1 step to the left, same as my position? Or is it a separate object?)

Wait, looking back, the objects list includes:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left

- rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down

So the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left (same as the initial position?), and the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 6 steps down. So I need to move down from the ""is"" rule's position to reach the ""baba"" rule.

Once there, move the ""is"" rule to be between ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is at 9 steps right, so I need to move the ""is"" rule from its current position (1 step left) to between ""baba"" (1 step left, 6 down) and ""win"" (9 right). That seems impossible because the horizontal distance is too great.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" rule can be moved to the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules located at different positions. This requires precise movement.

Alternatively, create a new ""is"" rule adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" But there's already an ""is"" rule at 1 step left. Maybe delete that rule by stepping on it? No, in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks but not delete them unless you have a ""push"" action and the block isn't stopped.

This is quite challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be under Baba's control. For example, making ""win is baba,"" so wherever Baba is, it's a win. But that would require rearranging the rules.

Alternatively, make ""baba"" the win by creating ""baba is win."" To do this, I need to have the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win.""

Given the current positions:

- ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left, 6 steps down.

- ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left (same x as ""baba"" but different y). So I can move the ""is"" rule down to the ""baba"" rule's location, then right to align with the ""win"" rule.

So steps:

1. Move down from the ""is"" rule's position (1 step left) to reach the ""baba"" rule (1 step left, 6 down).

2. Once there, move the ""is"" rule to the right, aligning it between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But moving right from 1 step left to 9 steps right would require passing through walls. There's a wall at 4 steps right, so that's a problem.

Alternatively, find a path around the wall. Maybe move down further, then right, then up. For example:

- From ""baba"" rule's position (1 left, 6 down), move down to avoid walls.

But the walls are at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, etc. This is getting too complicated without a visual map.

Another approach: Since the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, maybe combining ""baba"" with ""you"" and then changing ""you"" to ""win."" For example, moving the ""is"" rule to make ""you is win,"" making whatever is ""you"" the win condition. Since Baba is ""you,"" this would make Baba the win.

To do that:

1. Move to the ""you"" rule's location (1 step right, 6 down).

2. Bring the ""is"" rule there to create ""you is win.""

Once that's done, touching the ""you"" (which is Baba) would make me win.

So steps:

- Navigate from current position (assuming near ""is"" rule at 1 left) to the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 6 down.

- Move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to ""you"" and ""win.""

But again, navigating through obstacles is the main hurdle.

Given the complexity, maybe the best immediate action is to try moving right towards the ""win"" object, even if blocked, to see if there's a way around. Alternatively, move down to avoid walls and then right.

Given the previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action now is to move right toward the ""win"" location, as the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left, and moving right would start heading towards the ""win"" at 9 steps right. However, there's a wall at 4 steps right, so maybe moving right 3 times, then down, then right again? Not sure.

Alternatively, since the ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, maybe moving towards that to manipulate it.

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. The most logical step, given the active rules and the need to change them, is to move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""baba"" and ""win."" Since the ""is"" rule is currently 1 step left, moving it down to the ""baba"" rule's location (1 left, 6 down), then right towards the ""win"" at 9 right. But this requires passing through walls.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move right, aiming to get closer to the ""win"" object and the ""is"" rule, hoping to rearrange them into the desired rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. So, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule at 8 steps to the right. But there's also a wall at 3 steps to the right and some other obstacles. Maybe those walls are stoppers or stops. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. So, anything that's stop can't be moved past, right?

Baba is currently at 2 steps to the left. Wait, no—wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 steps to the left and 6 steps down. So, that means the Baba object is there. And there's an `is` rule at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So, maybe that's defining something else.

The user tip says to consider breaking existing rules or creating new ones. Let me see. The ""is"" blocks are movable unless they're stopped. The walls are defined as stop, so I can't push them. The door is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe that's a way through if I can change the door's property.

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can move Baba. The goal is to reach ""win,"" which is at 8 steps right. The problem is the wall at 3 steps right and possibly others blocking the path. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows passing through walls or redefining win.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 2 steps left. If I can grab that ""is"" rule and move it next to another object, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall,"" it could make ""wall is stop"" or something. But wait, the existing rules already have ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left""—maybe that's making existing walls stop.

Alternatively, maybe I need to make ""you"" into something else. The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. If I can move that and attach it to the ""win"" object, then ""win is you,"" making the win condition something I can be. But right now, ""baba is you,"" so I need to change that.

Wait, the active rules only show ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""wall is stop"" are probably part of the level's initial setup but not active unless defined. Wait no, the active rules are listed as ""baba is you."" The other objects have rules attached to them, but maybe those are just part of the level's layout, not active rules. Or are they?

In Baba Is You, the active rules are the ones that are on the board as text blocks. So in the current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The rest are objects with properties, but those properties are defined by other rules. For example, the wall at 3 steps right is probably because there's a ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else. But in the active rules list, it's only ""baba is you.""

So, to proceed, I need to move the ""is"" rules to create new rules. The ""is"" at 2 steps left can be moved. If I move it to the ""win"" object at 8 steps right, then ""win is [something]."" But what? If I make ""win is you,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But right now, ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""win is you,"" then reaching it would work.

Alternatively, maybe create ""you is win,"" so that Baba, being you, would turn into win upon contact. But I need to form the rule correctly. The ""is"" block can be moved to link two objects. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win"" would make ""baba is win,"" but that would change the win condition to be Baba himself, which might not help.

Wait, the tip says to sometimes change what counts as the win condition. So maybe I need to reassign the ""win"" rule. The current ""win"" is an object at 8 steps right. If I can move the ""is"" rule to make ""win is you,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But how?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 2 steps left. If I move that ""is"" to the ""win"" object and then to ""you,"" that could work. So the steps would be: move left to get to the ""is"" rule, then move right towards the ""win"" and ""you"" objects to create the new rule.

But in the current observation, Baba is at 2 steps left and 6 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 2 steps left, same as Baba. So maybe I need to pick up the ""is"" rule and carry it to the ""win"" and ""you"" objects. Let me check the positions again.

Baba's position: rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 6 steps down. The `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So, Baba is one step to the right of the `is` rule. So, perhaps I can move left to pick up the `is` rule, then move right towards the win area.

The goal is to get to the ""win"" at 8 steps right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. Since the wall is a stop, I can't push it, but maybe I can move around it. However, if I can create a rule that makes the wall not a stop, that would help. For example, if I can make ""wall is nothing"" or ""stop is you,"" but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""you is win,"" then by being you (Baba), touching the win object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to ""you"" and ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. The ""win"" is at 8 steps right. So, if I can carry the `is` rule from the current position (1 step left, 6 down) to the ""you"" at 1 step right, 6 down, then to the ""win"" at 8 right, that would create ""you is win.""

But how to get there? Let's outline the steps:

1. Current position: Baba is at 2 left, 6 down. The `is` rule is at 1 left, 6 down. So, move left once to grab the `is` rule.

2. Now holding `is`, move right to reach the `you` rule at 1 right, 6 down. From 1 left to 1 right is moving two steps right. But need to check if there are any obstacles. The path should be clear since the walls are further right.

3. Once next to `you`, place the `is` rule between `you` and `you` itself? Wait, no. To create ""you is win,"" you need the `is` rule between `you` and `win`. So after placing the `is` next to `you`, move right to the `win` at 8 steps right and place the `is` there, making the rule ""you is win.""

This way, since Baba is you, touching the win object would make you win. So the plan is to move the `is` rule from its current position to link `you` and `win`.

But how to navigate there? Let's see the positions:

- Starting at Baba's position: 2 left, 6 down.

- The `is` rule is 1 left, 6 down. So moving left once gets me there.

- Then, from 1 left, 6 down, moving right to reach `you` at 1 right, 6 down: that's two steps right.

- Then from there, moving right to 8 right (the win's position) would require seven steps right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step down, and others. But since I'm moving horizontally, maybe the vertical position isn't an issue. Wait, the movement is step by step, either up, down, left, or right. So to get from 1 right, 6 down to 8 right, 6 down (assuming the win is on the same row), I need to move right seven times.

But along the way, at 3 steps right, there's a wall. But since I'm moving horizontally, and the wall is at 3 right, 1 step down, that's a different row. So moving right from 1 right, 6 down, the path to 8 right, 6 down is clear except for the wall at 3 right, 1 down, which is below. So no collision. Therefore, I can move right seven times to reach the win's position.

Once there, placing the `is` rule next to `win` and `you` would create the new rule ""you is win,"" making the win condition something I am. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" then touching the win object would make me win.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move left once to pick up the `is` rule.

2. Move right twice to reach the `you` rule.

3. Move right seven times to reach the `win` object.

4. Place the `is` rule between `you` and `win` to create ""you is win.""

5. Then move to the `win` object and touch it, winning the level.

But the problem is that each step must be a single action (left, right, up, down). So in each step, I need to navigate accordingly.

Given the current observation, the `is` rule is 1 step to the left of Baba. So the first action should be 'left' to move towards it.

Wait, in the latest observation before the final one, Baba is at 2 step to the left and 6 steps down, and the `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So the distance between them is one step to the left. Therefore, moving left once would allow Baba to pick up the `is` rule.

Once the `is` is picked up, the next step is to move right to the `you` rule, which is at 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. So from 1 left to 1 right is two steps right. But maybe the user is expecting a single action at a time. So in the current observation, the assistant needs to output one action: either left, right, up, down, or idle.

Given that the current Baba position is next to the `is` rule, the correct action would be to move left to pick up the `is` rule. Wait, but in the observation, the `is` rule is 1 step to the left of Baba. So if Baba is at 2 left, 6 down, and the `is` is at 1 left, 6 down, then moving left once would bring Baba to the `is` rule's position, allowing them to pick it up.

Therefore, the correct action here is 'left' to grab the `is` rule. Once that's done, subsequent steps would involve moving right to the `you` and `win` positions.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You problem step by step. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is usually a door or a flag, but since the rules can change, I need to be flexible.

First, I look at the active rules. Right now, the only rule is ""baba is you."" That means whatever I do, Baba can perform those actions. The other objects on the map are walls, a ball, a door labeled as ""win,"" and some ""stop"" rules that make objects immovable.

Looking at the objects:

- There's a ""win"" rule at 9 steps to the right. But the actual ""win"" object is a door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. So the door is the target to touch.

- The ball is at 1 step right. Maybe moving it could be useful, but I don't see a clear way to use it yet.

- There are several walls and a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. That means anything on or touching that stop block can't be moved.

Baba's current position is at 1 step left. The ""is"" rule is also 1 step left, so maybe that's part of a rule that's not active yet. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, which is far away.

Since ""baba is you,"" I can move Baba around. My immediate goal is to reach the door at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. But the path is blocked by walls and a stop rule.

Let me map out the positions:

- Starting position: Baba is 1 step left. So maybe the player is at the leftmost part of the map.

- To get to the door, I need to move right past several walls. The walls are at 4 steps right, 1 step down, etc. The stop rule at 3 steps right, 3 steps down is a problem because anything touching it can't be moved. So if I try to push a wall past the stop, it would get stuck.

Wait, but since I'm Baba and the rules are ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push objects? In Baba Is You, if you're the ""you"" object, you can move. Here, since Baba is you, I can move, but can I push other objects? Typically, you can push objects if they're not stopped. But the stop rule here is at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. So any object touching that stop can't be moved.

Looking at the wall at 4 steps right, 2 steps down: is there a way to get around it? The door is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to create a new path.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left. If I move that ""is"" rule next to another text block, I can change a rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""door is you,"" that could help. But how?

Right now, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" The other rules are on the map but not active because they're separate. To activate them, I need to touch them and combine them with an ""is"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object (the door) would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. However, the ""is"" is currently at 1 step left, which is far from the win rule at 9 steps right. The path is blocked by walls and stops.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" into something else, like ""you is win,"" but that might not help. Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I'm the you object. So I can move, but maybe I can change the ""you"" property to something else.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""ball"" at 1 step right. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then the ball would be controllable. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and then the ""you"" rule. But the ""is"" is at 1 step left, and the ""you"" is at 6 steps down, which is a long way.

Another approach: The ""door"" is the win object. If I can make the door movable or myself into the door, that could work. But the door's rule is ""door is win,"" which is fixed unless I can change it. To change ""door is win,"" I need to replace the ""win"" part, but there's no ""not win"" rule here.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can move that stop rule away, maybe I can push walls past it. But since I'm Baba, and the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. The stop rule makes objects immovable. So if I can push a wall that's adjacent to the stop, but the stop is at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. The wall there is at 4 steps right, 3 steps down. So if I try to push that wall left, but the stop is blocking its movement. So that wall can't be moved.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to rearrange the rules instead of moving physically. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule. The ""is"" is currently at 1 step left. Moving right towards the win rule at 9 steps right would require passing through walls and stops, which is difficult.

Alternatively, the ""ball"" is at 1 step right. If I can make ""ball is you,"" then I can control the ball. But again, the path to the ball is short. Let me check the positions again.

Baba's position: 1 step left. The ""is"" rule is also 1 step left. The ball is 1 step to the right. So if I move right once, I can get to the ball. Then, move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" and the ""you"" rule to make ""ball is you."" Then, I could control the ball and move it to the door.

Wait, but the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. That's a long distance. So moving the ""is"" rule to the ball (which is 1 step right), then moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""you"" rule. But the ""you"" is far down. This might not be feasible.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" has a rule at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right. So the distance is too great.

Another idea: The ""door"" is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can make the door movable, perhaps by removing the ""stop"" rule. But the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. To remove it, I would need to break the ""stop"" rule, which requires that ""stop"" is not a property. But how? Maybe by changing the rule to ""stop is not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" rule here.

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then the stop rule would become controllable. But again, the distance is an issue.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball to push something. If I can make the ball ""you,"" then I can move the ball past the stop rule. Let's try that plan:

1. Move right to the ball (1 step right).
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule that's at 1 step left.
3. Move the ""is"" rule to the ball and the ""you"" rule to create ""ball is you.""
4. Now, control the ball and move it towards the door, avoiding the stop rule.

But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. To get there from the ball's position (1 step right), I need to move down 5 steps, which is possible but there are walls along the way. Also, the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe creating a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the existing ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" has a rule at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, and ""win"" is at 9 steps right. The distance is too far to move there physically.

Another angle: The ""door"" is the win object. If I can make myself the door, that would work. So changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is door."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""door."" The ""door"" is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left. So moving right 7 steps to reach the door's position, but there are walls at 4 steps right, making it impassable.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's recap the possible actions:

- Move up, down, left, right, or idle.

Given the current position of Baba (1 step left) and the ""is"" rule also at 1 step left, maybe the best immediate move is to grab the ""is"" rule and start moving it towards a target rule to create a new rule.

For example, moving right to the ball (1 step right), then using the ""is"" to make ""ball is you."" Let's try that step by step:

1. Move right once to get to the ball (1 step right).
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule (which is at 1 step left, same as Baba's starting position).
3. Move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and the ""you"" rule to create ""ball is you.""
4. Now, as the ball's ""you,"" move it towards the door.

But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, which is far down. From the ball's position (1 step right), moving down 5 steps would reach the ""you"" rule. However, the path down has walls at 4 steps right and 1 step down, etc. Also, the stop rule at 3 steps right, 3 steps down might block movement.

Alternatively, after making the ball ""you,"" move the ball right towards the win area. The ball is at 1 step right. Moving right 7 steps would get it to the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right, 1 step down, etc. So the ball might get stuck.

Alternatively, use the ball to push a wall aside. But since the wall at 4 steps right is next to a stop rule, it can't be moved.

This seems challenging. Maybe the solution is to create a rule that allows Baba to move through stops or walls. For example, ""baba is stop"" would make Baba able to move through stops, but that requires creating that rule.

To create ""baba is stop,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right, 3 steps down. The distance from Baba's current position (1 step left) to the ""stop"" rule is quite far, with many obstacles.

Another idea: The ""door"" is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can make the door ""you,"" then touching it would win. To do that, I need to create ""door is you."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. So moving the ""is"" rule to the door and the ""you"" rule would require a lot of movement.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""win"" rule to be under Baba. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, and moving it there would require moving right past walls.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is a separate object; touching it doesn't do anything unless the rule says ""baba is win."" So unless I change the rules, touching the win object (the door) won't help.

Putting this all together, the most feasible immediate action might be to move right towards the ball and then manipulate the rules to make the ball ""you,"" allowing me to control it and maybe navigate around the obstacles. Alternatively, try to move the ""is"" rule towards the ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

But given the current positions, moving right seems like a start. Let's see:

Baba is at 1 step left. The ""is"" rule is also there. The ball is 1 step to the right. Moving right once gets me to the ball. Then, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to the ""you"" rule to create ""ball is you."" Once that's done, I can control the ball and move it towards the door.

But the ""you"" rule is far down. From the ball's position (1 step right), moving down 5 steps to reach the ""you"" rule at 1 step right, 6 steps down. Along the way, there are walls at 4 steps right, 1 step down, etc., but maybe I can navigate around them by moving the ball in a different direction.

Alternatively, after making the ball ""you,"" move the ball right towards the ""win"" rule at 8 steps right. The ball would need to pass through several walls, but perhaps by rearranging the rules, those walls can be moved or bypassed.

This plan seems possible but requires several precise moves. Given the limited observation provided, the immediate action should be to move right towards the ball to start manipulating the rules.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but sometimes you have to change the rules to make that possible. Let's look at the current observation.

The active rules are ""baba is you"", so I can control Baba. The objects on the map include several ""rule is"" blocks, walls, a stop, a door, a ball, and the win object. The win is 8 steps to the right, but there's a wall (3 steps to the right) and a stop block (3 steps to the right and 3 steps down) blocking the path. There's also a door at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down.

First, I need to check if I can move towards the win object. But the path to the right is blocked by walls and a stop block. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position? Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks. To change a rule, I have to push the ""is"" block and combine it with another object. For example, if there's a ""win"" rule somewhere, I can move the ""is"" to make it ""something else IS win"".

Looking at the objects, there are several ""rule is"" blocks. The one 2 steps to the left might be part of a rule like ""ball is win"" or something. Let me check. The current active rules only show ""baba is you"". The other rules must be inactive because they're not connected properly. So maybe I can rearrange the text blocks to create new rules.

The ball is at 1 step to the right. If I can make ""ball is win"", then stepping on the ball would make it the win condition. But how? There's a ""rule is"" block 2 steps to the left. If I can push that ""is"" block to the ball and the win, maybe I can create ""ball is win"". Let's see:

The ""is"" block is 2 steps to the left of Baba. So if I move left twice, I can reach the ""is"" block. Then, I can move it to the ball (which is 1 step to the right) and the win (8 steps to the right). But moving left to get the ""is"" block might be possible. Once I have the ""is"" block, I can place it between the ball and the win to make ""ball is win"". Then, stepping on the ball would make it the win object.

But wait, can I move the ""is"" block? The rules say I can move objects that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move Baba, and any objects that are not stopped. Looking at the objects, the walls are there, but the ""is"" blocks, ball, door, etc., aren't marked as stop. So I should be able to move the ""is"" block.

So the plan is:

1. Move left to get to the ""is"" block that's 2 steps to the left of Baba.
2. Carry that ""is"" block to the ball (1 step to the right) and the win (8 steps to the right).
3. Place the ""is"" block between the ball and win to create ""ball is win"".
4. Then, move to the ball and touch it, which would now make me win.

But how to physically move the ""is"" block? Let's see the current position of Baba. The observations show that in previous steps, Baba was at different positions, but the latest observation has ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down"". Wait, the exact position of Baba might be important here. Let me parse the observation again.

In the current observation, the objects include ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down"". So Baba is located at 2 steps to the left and 6 steps down from the reference point (probably the top-left corner). The ""is"" block is 2 steps to the left, which might be in the same row or column as Baba. Assuming that the ""is"" block is in the same row as Baba, moving left twice would get to it. But need to check if there are any walls blocking the path.

Looking at the map layout:

- Walls are at 3 steps to the right, 1 step down, etc. So moving left from Baba's position (2 left, 6 down) to get to the ""is"" block (2 left, same as Baba?), maybe it's adjacent. If the ""is"" block is directly to the left of Baba, then moving left once would reach it. But the observation says the ""is"" block is 2 steps to the left. So if Baba is at (0,0), the ""is"" is at (-2, 0). But perhaps the coordinates are relative. This part is a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" block is two positions to the left of Baba's current position. So if I move left twice, I can pick up the ""is"" block. Then, carry it to the ball, which is 1 step to the right of Baba's original position? Or is the ball at 1 step to the right from the ""is"" block's position?

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach: since the win is 8 steps to the right, but there's a wall blocking the way, perhaps I can use the door at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If I can make the door not a stop, then I could go through it. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""door is you"", so I can push the door. But the current rule is ""baba is you"", so I need to change that. Wait, if I can create a rule like ""door is you"", then I can control the door and maybe push it open or through. But how to create that rule?

To create a new rule, I need to have an ""is"" block and combine it with two objects. For example, if there's a ""door"" and an ""you"" rule, but currently, the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down. The ""you"" rule is separate, so I can move the ""is"" block to combine it with door and you. Let's see:

There's a ""rule `you` 6 steps down"". So the ""you"" text block is at that position. If I can move the ""is"" block next to door and you, then I can make ""door is you"". Then, I can control the door and maybe use it to reach the win.

But the door is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. To get there, I would need to navigate through the walls and stops. Alternatively, if I make the door movable by changing its rule, perhaps I can push it towards the win.

But first, let's see the available ""is"" blocks. There's one at 2 steps to the left and another at 7 steps to the right. The one at 2 steps to the left is probably the one we need to use.

So steps:

1. Move left twice to reach the ""is"" block at 2 steps left.
2. Carry the ""is"" block to the door (7 steps right, 3 down) and the ""you"" rule (6 down).
3. Place the ""is"" between door and you to make ""door is you"".
4. Now, the door is controlled by me (since I'm Baba and ""you"" is active). Maybe I can push the door through the stop block or around.

But the door is at 7 steps right, 3 down. The stop block is at 3 steps right, 3 down. The path to the win is blocked by a wall at 4 steps right, 2 down and a stop at 3 steps right, 3 down. If I can move the door into the stop block's position, maybe the stop is no longer blocking? Or perhaps the door can be used to bypass the stop.

Alternatively, once ""door is you"", maybe I can move the door to the win's position. But the win is at 8 steps right, which is beyond the existing walls. Not sure.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the wall passable. For example, ""wall is stop"" but that doesn't help. Or ""wall is nothing"", but I don't know how to do that.

Another idea: If I can make the ball the win, then just reach the ball. To do that, create ""ball is win"". The ball is at 1 step right. So pick up the ""is"" block, move it to the ball and the win, then place it to make ""ball is win"". Then, stepping on the ball would make me win.

But how to get to the ball? The ball is 1 step to the right of Baba's current position (if Baba is at 2 left, 6 down, then right would be towards lower steps). Wait, the coordinates might be relative. This is a bit confusing without a visual, but let's assume that moving right increases the x-coordinate.

If the ball is 1 step to the right of Baba, then moving right once would reach it. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. So the path to the right is blocked by walls until step 4. But the ball is at 1 step right, which is early on. So maybe there's a path to the right that's clear.

Wait, looking at the objects:

- wall 4 steps to the right (so at x=4)
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right (x=8)
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right (x=9)
- ball 1 step to the right (x=1)
- wall 2 left and 1 down (probably x=-2, y=1)
- etc.

So the map's right side has walls starting at x=4, then open space until x=8 where there's an ""is"" and ""win"". The ball is at x=1. So if I move right from Baba's position (assuming x=2, since the ""is"" is 2 steps left), moving right once gets to x=3, which is a wall. So I can't go directly right. Hmm, that's a problem.

So to reach the ball at x=1, which is to the left of Baba's current position (if Baba is at x=2), then moving left would be the way. But the ball is at x=1, which is adjacent to x=2. So if I move left once, I reach the ball. But wait, the ball is at 1 step to the right of Baba. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is different. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 6 steps down"" means that Baba is located two steps to the left and six steps down from the starting reference point. The ""is"" block is two steps to the left, which would be in the same horizontal position but different vertical? Or same vertical?

This is challenging without a visual grid. Let's try to think of the map in terms of relative positions.

Assuming Baba is at position (0,0):

- ""rule `is`"" is at (-2, 0)
- ""ball"" is at (1, 0)
- walls at (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), etc.
- ""win"" at (9,0)
- ""door"" at (7,3)
- ""stop"" at (3,3)
- ""you"" rule at (1,6)

So the map's right side has walls from x=4 onwards. To reach the ball at (1,0), I need to move left from (0,0) to (-1,0), then (-2,0) is the ""is"" block. But the ball is at (1,0), which is to the right. However, moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) is possible if there's no wall. But according to the objects, there's a wall at (4,0), but nothing blocking at (1,0). So maybe moving right once gets to the ball.

Wait, the objects listed are:

- ball 1 step to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right

So the ball is at x=1, wall at x=4, then empty until x=8. So moving right from Baba's position (0,0) to x=1 is possible. Then, the ball is there. If I can create ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win.

To do that, I need to get the ""is"" block at (-2,0) and move it to the ball (1,0) and the win (9,0). So carry the ""is"" block from (-2,0) to (1,0) and place it between ball and win to make ""ball is win"". Then move to the ball and step on it.

But how to move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move. The ""is"" block isn't stopped, so I can pick it up and carry it. So the steps would be:

1. Move left twice from (0,0) to reach the ""is"" block at (-2,0).
2. Carry the ""is"" block to the ball at (1,0). This would require moving right three times (from -2 to 1 is +3 steps).
3. Once at (1,0), place the ""is"" block next to the ball and the win. But the win is at (9,0), which is far away. Maybe instead, place the ""is"" block next to the ball and say ""win"" is somewhere else. Wait, but the existing ""win"" rule is at (9,0). So maybe just placing ""ball is win"" by putting the ""is"" between ball and win.

But how to position them? If I have the ""is"" block at (1,0) next to the ball, then I need to push it towards the ""win"" rule at (9,0). But that's a long distance. Alternatively, maybe the text blocks only need to be adjacent in the same row or column. So if I place the ""is"" block between the ball and the existing ""win"" rule, which is 8 steps to the right, then it would form ""ball is win"".

But the ""win"" rule is at (8,0), so placing the ""is"" between ball (1,0) and win (8,0) would require the ""is"" to be in between. But moving the ""is"" from (-2,0) to (1,0) is possible, then from (1,0) to (8,0) to place next to win. That would take 7 steps right. Once placed, the rule would be active, making ball the win.

Then, stepping on the ball at (1,0) would make me win.

But wait, the ball is at (1,0), which is adjacent to Baba's starting position (0,0). So after creating the ""ball is win"" rule, moving right once to the ball and then interacting with it would win the level.

So the action plan is:

- Move left twice to get the ""is"" block.
- Move right three times to reach the ball.
- Move right seven more times to reach the ""win"" rule.
- Place the ""is"" between ball and win to create ""ball is win"".
- Move left back to the ball and step on it.

But navigating through the map might have walls. For example, moving right from Baba's initial position (0,0) to (1,0) is clear. Then to (2,0), is there a wall? The walls start at x=4, so (2,0) is clear. Continue moving right until reaching x=8 (the ""is"" rule's position), then place the ""is"" block between ball (1,0) and win (8,0). But how to arrange them properly?

Alternatively, once the ""is"" block is at (1,0), adjacent to the ball, push it towards the win. Each push would move the ""is"" block one step. So from (1,0), move right to (2,0) while carrying the ""is"", then place it next to the win at (8,0). But that would require multiple moves.

This seems complicated, but manageable. Let's outline the steps in actions:

1. From (0,0), move left twice to (-2,0) to get the ""is"" block.
2. Move right three times to (1,0), where the ball is.
3. Now, need to move the ""is"" block from (1,0) to be adjacent to both ball and win. The win is at (8,0), so move right seven times to (8,0), placing the ""is"" block between ball and win. But how to ensure they are adjacent? Maybe after placing the ""is"" next to the ball, then push it all the way to the win.

Alternatively, when you place the ""is"" block next to the ball, it becomes ""ball is [something]"". To make it ""ball is win"", the ""win"" should be adjacent. So perhaps after placing the ""is"" next to the ball, move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent. But the ""win"" rule is at (8,0), which is far away. This might not be feasible.

Another approach: Since the ""win"" rule is already on the map at (8,0), maybe we can just associate the ball with it by placing the ""is"" between them. So even if they're not adjacent, maybe in the game, the rule ""ball is win"" is created if the text blocks are in the same row or column, regardless of distance. But I'm not sure. In Baba Is You, the rules require the text blocks to be adjacent horizontally or vertically to form the rule.

So to create ""ball is win"", the ""ball"" and ""win"" text blocks must be adjacent, with the ""is"" block in between. Therefore, I need to move the ""ball"" next to the ""win"" or vice versa, and place the ""is"" in between.

But the ball is at (1,0) and the win is at (8,0). They're far apart. So perhaps this isn't the right path. Maybe instead, create a rule that makes the door the win. The door is at (7,3). If I can make ""door is win"", then reaching the door would win. But how?

To do that, I need to get the ""is"" block to the door and the win. The door is at (7,3), win at (8,0). That's a diagonal distance. Maybe move the ""is"" block to (7,3) and (8,0","

88,left,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with things. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I should check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" 8 steps to the right. However, there's also a ""ball"" 8 steps to the right. Maybe the solution involves manipulating the rules to change what's considered a win or make the ball a win. 

There are several ""is"" rules nearby. The rule `is` is 2 steps to the left, and another one at 1 step to the left at 6 steps down. Also, there's a `you` rule at 6 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can pick up an ""is"" text block to create a new rule.

If I can move the `is` text block next to ""ball"" or ""win,"" I could change the rules. For example, if I make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win the level. Alternatively, if I change ""baba is win,"" then touching myself would work. 

But how do I move the `is` blocks? The directions show the `is` at 2 steps left. If I move left, I can reach it. However, moving left from my current position might take me to the `is` block. Once I have the `is`, I can carry it to the ball or win and place it there to form a new rule. 

Wait, the `you` rule is at 6 steps down. If I can make ""you"" something else, maybe ""you"" could be the ball, allowing me to move the ball. But I need to be careful because some objects are ""stop,"" meaning they can't be moved. 

Another thought: if I can make ""stop"" not a stop, by redefining it. For example, ""stop is you,"" then I could move the stop blocks. But that might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe pushing the ball towards the win by moving it. If I can move the ball, which would require ""you"" to be assigned to ball. So if I create ""ball is you,"" then I could move the ball towards the win. 

So steps could be:
1. Move left to grab the `is` text block at 2 steps left.
2. Carry it to the ball at 8 steps right and 4 steps down (since ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down? Wait, the observation says ""rule `ball` 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down."" So the ball is 7 steps right and 4 down from me. But I'm currently at a position where the `is` is 2 steps left. Maybe my current position is somewhere in the middle. 

Wait, the exact positions might be a bit confusing without the visual map, but based on the observations, the `is` block is 2 steps to the left. So if I move left twice, I can get to that `is` block. Then, I can pick it up and move it to the ball's location. 

Once I place ""is"" next to ""ball,"" I can create ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition. Then, moving to the ball would win the level. Alternatively, ""ball is you"" to control the ball and push it. 

But I need to check if moving the `is` block is possible. Since ""baba is you,"" and assuming that text blocks can be moved unless they're ""stop."" The `is` rule itself isn't a stop, so I can move it. 

So the plan is: move left to get the `is` block, then move right to the ball and create ""ball is win."" Alternatively, create ""ball is you"" and move the ball to the win. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""win"" something else. For example, ""you is win"" would make touching yourself a win. But since I'm already ""you,"" that might not be necessary. 

Another angle: the `door` is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the wall in front of the door, maybe by redefining ""stop."" But that might require more complex rule changes. 

But the most straightforward path seems to be manipulating the ""win"" condition to be the ball. So picking up the `is` block, moving it to the ball, and placing it to form ""ball is win."" 

So step-by-step actions would be:
1. Move left twice to reach the `is` block at 2 steps left.
2. Pick up the `is` block (assuming I can carry it since I'm ""you"").
3. Move right to the ball's position (7 steps right, 4 steps down).
4. Place the `is` block next to the ball to form ""ball is win.""
5. Then move to the ball to win.

But in the current observation, after moving left previously, the `is` block is now 1 step to the left. Wait, no—the observation shows after some moves, the `is` position changes. Need to track the movement correctly. 

Given the latest observation, the `is` is 1 step to the left. So maybe the agent is positioned such that moving left once gets to the `is` block. Then, moving right to the ball. 

Alternatively, if the agent is at the position where `is` is 1 step left, moving left once would get to the `is`, then moving right towards the ball. 

Once the `is` is placed with the ball, the active rule becomes ""ball is win,"" so touching the ball wins. 

Therefore, the next valid action should be moving left to reach the `is` block, then right to the ball. But the system might require a single action per step. So the immediate action needed is to move left to grab the `is` block.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, but I remember that in Baba Is You, the rules can be changed, so I need to check if the 'win' condition is still what it seems.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a 'win' rule 9 steps to the right. But there's also a 'door' at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, and a 'ball' at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. The walls are spread out, and there's a 'stop' rule at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, which is probably attached to Baba since we're controlling him.

Right now, the 'is' rule is 1 step to the left. So maybe I can move that 'is' block to combine with other text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make 'baba is win' or 'win is you', that could change the goal. But how?

Baba's position is at 1 step left and 6 steps down, according to the 'baba' rule. The 'you' rule is adjacent to him there. So I'm controlling Baba. The nearby 'is' rule is 1 step to the left of where I am. If I can move that 'is' block to the 'ball' or 'door', maybe I can create a new rule like 'ball is you' or 'door is win'.

But wait, to move the 'is' block, I need to make sure I can push it. Since I'm Baba and the rules are 'baba is you', I can push objects that aren't stopped. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is further away. So maybe I can move left or right towards the 'is' block.

Looking at the current observation, the 'is' block is 1 step to the left of Baba. If I move left, I can get to the 'is' block. But once I pick it up, I can move it somewhere else to create a new rule. For example, moving the 'is' block next to the 'win' rule to make 'win is you', which would mean touching the win object makes me win. Alternatively, moving it to the 'ball' to make 'ball is you', so I can become the ball and reach the win area.

But wait, the 'win' is 9 steps to the right, which is quite far. There's a wall at 4 steps right, so I might need to push walls or use other objects to get through. Alternatively, if I can turn a wall into a stop or something movable, that could help. Let's check the rules again.

The existing rules are 'baba is you', 'rule is', 'wall is wall', 'stop is stop', 'door is door', 'ball is ball'. So the 'is' rule allows me to create new rules by placing two text blocks adjacent to each other. For example, if I move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win', that would make 'baba is win', changing the goal to being Baba but also making win a different property. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if I can make 'you is win', then whatever is 'you' would become the win condition. Since I'm currently 'you' (because of the 'you' rule at 1 step right, 6 steps down), maybe combining that with 'win' would make me the win. Wait, but the 'you' rule is separate. If I can move the 'is' block to connect 'you' and 'win', that would make 'you is win', meaning I (as you) become the win condition. So touching me would win the level.

But how to position that. The 'you' rule is at 1 step right, 6 steps down. The 'win' rule is 9 steps to the right. So I need to get the 'is' block between 'you' and 'win'. But the distance is too big. Maybe there's a closer 'win' instance? No, the 'win' is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, but that's the door's position. Wait, no—the 'win' rule is at 9 steps to the right, which is a separate block. So it's straight right from the starting point.

Alternatively, maybe the door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down is a way through. If I can push the wall to the right to clear a path, but the walls are at 4 steps right and down, so maybe not. Alternatively, if I can make a 'push' rule, but there's no 'push' rule defined. The only movable things are the text blocks that aren't stopped. Since 'is' is a text block, and it's not stopped, I can move it.

So the plan is: move the 'is' block that's 1 step to the left of Baba to the 'you' and 'win' blocks to create 'you is win', making Baba (since he's you) the win condition. But how to reach those blocks. The 'you' is at 1 step right, 6 steps down, and the 'win' is 9 steps to the right. That's a long distance. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, looking at the current map, after moving left a few times, there's a 'rule is' at 1 step left, then Baba, then ball to the right, walls further right. The 'is' block is 1 step left of Baba. So if I move left, I can get to the 'is' block. Then, carry it to the 'you' and 'win' positions.

But moving left from my current position (Baba at 1 left, 6 down) would take me to the 'is' block. Then, move the 'is' block to the 'you' which is 1 step right, 6 down. So from the 'is' block at 1 left, 6 down, move right to attach it to 'you' and 'win'. Wait, the 'you' is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, which is adjacent to Baba. So if I move the 'is' block from 1 left to 1 step right (Baba's position), then place it between 'you' and 'win'.

But how to get the 'is' block next to both 'you' and 'win'. The 'win' is 9 steps to the right, which is way farther. Maybe there's a different approach. What if I make 'win is you', so touching the win object makes me win. To do that, I need to place 'win' and 'you' next to an 'is' block.

The 'you' is at 1 step right, 6 down. The 'win' is 9 steps to the right. So I need to move the 'is' block between them. But that's a distance of 8 steps right. That's not feasible by moving the 'is' block step by step unless there's a way to push multiple objects.

Alternatively, maybe combine other rules. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then since I'm Baba, I would be the win condition. To do that, move the 'is' block between 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left, 6 down (Baba's position), and 'win' is at 9 steps right. So again, a long distance.

Alternatively, look for the 'door' at 7 steps right, 3 down. If I can reach there, maybe it's a shortcut. But how? The path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. Unless I can push the walls, but there's a 'stop' rule at 3 right, 3 down. So pushing might not be possible.

Wait, the 'stop' rule means that objects with 'stop' can't be moved. So any wall that has 'stop' attached can't be pushed. The walls at 3 right, 3 down are stopped, so I can't move them. The other walls might be movable if they don't have 'stop'. Let me check: the 'wall' rules are at 1 left 1 down, 4 right 1 down, etc. The 'stop' rule is separate at 3 right 3 down. So the walls near the bottom (4 right, 3 down) are stopped. The others might be movable.

So maybe I can move the 'is' block to create a 'push' rule, but there's no 'push' rule. Alternatively, create a 'wall is push' or something, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, focus on the fact that I'm Baba and 'you', so maybe I can reach the 'win' by moving right past the walls. But the path to the right has walls at 4 steps, and beyond that, more walls. The 'win' is at 9 steps right, which is past those walls. Unless I can move the walls by pushing them, but the ones at 4 right are stopped.

Wait, maybe there's a way to turn the walls into something else. For example, if I can make 'wall is you', then since I'm 'you', I could push the walls. But to do that, I need to create the rule 'wall is you' by placing 'wall' and 'you' next to an 'is' block.

The 'you' rule is at 1 step right, 6 down. The 'wall' rules are at 1 left 1 down and 4 right 1 down, etc. If I can move the 'is' block to connect 'wall' and 'you', that would make 'wall is you', allowing me to push walls. Then I could push the walls to create a path to the 'win'.

So step by step:

1. Move the 'is' block that's 1 step to the left of Baba to the nearest 'wall' and 'you' blocks.
2. Once 'wall is you' is created, I can push walls.
3. Push the walls at 4 steps right to clear a path to the 'win' at 9 steps right.

But how to get the 'is' block there. Let's see. My current position is at Baba's position: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. The 'is' block is 1 step to the left of that, so at 2 steps left and 6 down. To get there, I need to move left once. Then, pick up the 'is' block and carry it to a 'wall' and 'you'.

The 'you' is at 1 step right, 6 down. So from the 'is' block at 2 left 6 down, moving right to 1 left 6 down (Baba's position), then right again to 0 left 6 down (adjacent to 'you'). Then place the 'is' block between 'wall' and 'you'. But where is the 'wall' near there? The 'wall' rule is at 1 left 1 down, which is above. Maybe not nearby.

Alternatively, the 'wall' at 4 right 1 down is further to the right. To reach there, I would need to move the 'is' block across the map, but that's a long way. Maybe this isn't the best approach.

Another idea: since I'm 'you', maybe I can make 'win is you', so touching the 'win' object makes me win. To do that, I need to create the rule 'win is you' by placing 'win' and 'you' next to an 'is' block.

The 'win' is at 9 steps right. The 'you' is at 1 step right, 6 down. The 'is' block is currently at 2 left 6 down. So I need to move the 'is' block all the way to the 'win' and 'you' area. That seems impossible in a few steps, but perhaps possible with a series of moves.

Alternatively, use the existing 'door' at 7 steps right, 3 down. If I can reach the door, maybe it's a way to bypass the walls. But how? The door is locked unless there's a 'key' or something, but there's no key mentioned. So probably not.

Wait, the 'door' is a rule at 7 steps right, 3 down. To open a door in Baba Is You, you usually need to push it or have a rule that allows it to be opened. Since there's no 'key' or 'open' rule, maybe the door is just a regular object unless a rule changes it. So maybe the door is just a wall that's not stopped, but I can't push it because it's a door unless there's a rule.

Alternatively, create a 'door is you' rule, making the door controllable. But that would require moving the 'is' block next to 'door' and 'you'.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap:

Current active rules:
- baba is you (so I can move and push non-stopped objects)
- All the wall, stop, door, ball rules are as per their positions.

Objects nearby:
- 'is' block 1 step left of Baba.
- 'you' rule adjacent to Baba.
- 'ball' to the right.
- Walls blocking the path to the right.

Possible actions:
1. Move the 'is' block to create a new rule that changes the win condition or makes movement possible.
2. Try to reach the 'win' by moving right past the walls, but that's blocked.
3. Use the 'ball' somehow, but not sure.

Let me try focusing on creating 'you is win'. To do that, I need to place 'you' and 'win' next to an 'is' block. The 'you' is at 1 step right, 6 down. The 'win' is at 9 steps right. The 'is' block is at 2 left, 6 down. So I need to move the 'is' block from 2 left 6 down to between 'you' and 'win'. That's a distance of 8 steps right and 0 down. Moving the 'is' block right 8 times would reach the 'win', but that's too many steps and might not be feasible in one go. Plus, there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. If I can move the 'is' block to a higher level (up or down) to reach the 'you' and 'win' more easily. Looking at the map, the 'you' is at 6 down, 'win' is at 9 right, same level. The 'is' block is at 6 down. The 'door' is at 3 steps down. Maybe moving up or down can help.

But the movement is step by step up, down, left, right. So unless there's a way to stack rules vertically, which I don't see, this might not help.

Another angle: The 'ball' is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. If I can make 'ball is win', then touching the ball would make me win. To do that, create the rule 'ball is win' by moving the 'is' block next to 'ball' and 'win'. The 'ball' is at 8 right,4 down. The 'win' is at 9 right. So move the 'is' block from 2 left,6 down to 8 right,4 down, then place it between 'ball' and 'win'. That's a distance of 10 steps right and 2 steps down. Too far.

Alternatively, create 'baba is win' so that being Baba (which I am) means I win. To do that, place 'baba' and 'win' next to 'is'. 'Baba' is at 1 left,6 down. 'Win' is at 9 right. The 'is' block is at 2 left,6 down. So move the 'is' block from 2 left to 1 left (adjacent to Baba), then move right to connect to 'win'. But again, the distance is too far.

Wait, maybe there's a rule I can create that allows me to push multiple blocks at once. For example, 'rule is push', but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, use the existing 'door' at 7 right,3 down. Maybe create a 'door is you' rule so I can move the door. Then push the door to open a path. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'door' and 'you'.

The 'door' is at 7 right,3 down. 'You' is at 1 right,6 down. The 'is' block is at 2 left,6 down. So moving the 'is' block from 2 left,6 down to 7 right,3 down would take a lot of steps. Not practical.

Hmm. Maybe the intended solution is simpler. Since I'm Baba and 'you', maybe I can just walk to the 'win' by moving right, but the path is blocked by walls. Let's check the path:

From my current position (1 left,6 down), moving right:

- 1 step right: ball at 1 right.
- 2 steps right: wall at 2 right.
- 3 steps right: wall at 3 right (stopped).
- 4 steps right: wall at 4 right.
- And so on, with more walls.

So the path to the right is blocked by walls starting at 2 right. Therefore, I can't move directly right past them.

Alternative approach: Use the 'ball' to push the walls. If I can make the ball a 'push' object, but there's no 'push' rule. Alternatively, make the ball 'you', then push it, but that might not help.

Wait, if I make 'ball is you', then I become the ball. So I can move as the ball. Then, if there's a way to push walls as the ball, but the rules would need to allow that. For example, if 'ball is push', then I could push walls. But there's no such rule.

Alternatively, create 'wall is push' by moving 'is' next to 'wall' and 'push', but there's no 'push' text block.

This is tricky. Maybe the key is to realize that the 'win' is at 9 steps right, but there's a 'door' at 7 steps right,3 down. Maybe the door leads to the win area. But how to open it.

Alternatively, create a 'key' by using the 'ball' as a key. In some levels, you can make a key by combining text blocks. For example, 'ball is key', then '","

90,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around freely unless there's something blocking me. Let's look at the objects on the map.

There's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move that to rewrite a rule. Also, there's a ball 1 step to the right and a wall 4 steps to the right. The ""win"" object is 9 steps to the right, which is pretty far. There are several walls and a stop block further right. 

Looking down, at 6 steps down, there's a ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" block. The ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left at 6 steps down. Maybe I can combine these to change what ""you"" is. 

If I move the ""rule `is`"" block that's 1 step to the left, maybe I can attach it to ""baba"" to make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Alternatively, if I can move the ""you"" rule to another object, like the ball, making ""ball is you,"" then I could become the ball and go towards the win. But the ball is 1 step to the right, and there's a wall 4 steps to the right. The stop block at 3 steps right might block movement. 

Wait, the ""door"" is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe if I can push the door or interact with it. But the door might be a stop block. Alternatively, if I can make ""door is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. But I need to create that rule. 

The ""rule `is`"" block is near the ball. If I move it to the ball and make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. But first, I need to move the rule `is` block to the ball's position. Since I'm currently where ""baba"" is (assuming I'm on the baba tile), I need to move left to get to the rule `is` block. 

Moving left once gets me to the rule `is`. Then, I can move that rule to the ball's location. But how? In Baba Is You, you can push objects like rules by moving into them when you're a you. Since I'm currently a you (because ""baba is you""), I can move the rule `is` block. 

So, step by step: move left to grab the rule `is`, then carry it right to the ball's position. Once there, place the rule to make ""ball is win."" Then, move to the ball and touch it to win. 

But the path might be blocked. There's a wall 4 steps to the right, but maybe I can go around. Alternatively, if I make the ball a win, I can go straight to it. 

Another approach: Make ""baba is win"" by moving the existing ""win"" rule to baba. But the ""win"" rule is 8 steps right. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""you"" rule. If I can make ""you is win,"" then I would be win. But how? The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. Maybe move that rule to a different object. 

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" If I can create a rule like ""you is win,"" then since I'm a you, I would be win. Let's see. The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. If I can move that rule to, say, the ball, making ""ball is you"" and ""you is win,"" then touching the ball would make me you and win. 

But how to move the ""you"" rule. Since I'm a you, I can push it. So, from my current position (assuming I'm at baba's location), move down to the ""you"" rule at 6 steps down, 1 step right. Then move the ""you"" rule to the ball's location. 

But the path might be blocked. There's a wall at 4 steps right, but maybe I can go around. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new ones. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move left to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left.
2. Carry it to the ball at 1 step right.
3. Place it there to make ""ball is win.""
4. Then move right to the ball and touch it to win.

But between me (at baba's position) and the ball, there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the wall is 4 steps to the right initially. Wait, current position: when the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left, that's my current position? Or where is the player?

Wait, the player is Baba, right? The ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 6 steps down in one of the observations. But in the latest observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So maybe the player is standing next to that. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me parse the latest observation:

Active rules: baba is you.

Objects:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left
- ball 1 step to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right
- rule `wall` 1 step left and 1 down
- walls down to step 5
- rule `door` at 8 right, 3 down
- rule `ball` at 8 right, 4 down
- rule `baba` at 1 left, 6 down
- rule `is` at 6 down
- rule `you` at 1 right, 6 down
- wall at 4 right, 6 down

Assuming the player is at the position of ""baba"" which is 1 step left and 6 down. So the player is on the baba tile there. 

To reach the ball at 1 step right, need to move right once. But there's a wall 4 steps to the right. Wait, the wall is 4 steps to the right from where? From the player's current position? If the player is at 1 left and 6 down, then 1 step right would be to the origin (0,6), then 4 steps right would be (4,6), which is a wall. 

So moving right from the player's position (assuming it's at (0,6)):

- Right 1 step: (1,6) – that's the ball.
- Then right to (4,6) is a wall. So the ball is adjacent to the player. 

So possible actions: move right to the ball. But the ball is a movable object? Since there's no rule saying it's stop, right? The only stop is the rule `stop` at 3 steps right and 3 down. 

So if the player moves right to the ball (1 step right), then they can pick it up? Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not stop. The ball isn't stop, so the player (being you) can move into it and push it. 

But the goal is to get to the win object. Alternatively, create a rule that makes the ball win. 

So, the plan is:

1. Move right to the ball (1 step right) and pick it up.
2. Move the ball towards the win rule (which is 8 steps to the right). But the path is blocked by walls. 
3. Alternatively, create a ""ball is win"" rule. To do that, need to move the ""rule `is`"" that's 1 step to the left (player's current position?) to the ball's location. 

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left of the player's position. So if the player is at (0,6), the ""rule `is`"" is at (-1,6). So the player needs to move left once to get to the ""rule `is`"" block. 

Then, carry that block to the ball's location at (1,6). Once there, place the ""is"" rule next to the ball to make ""ball is win"". 

After that, moving to the ball would make it win. 

So the steps would be:

- Left to get the ""is"" rule.
- Right twice to reach the ball (but need to check if there are walls in between). From (0,6) left to (-1,6) to get the ""is"" rule. Then right to (0,6), then right to (1,6) – that's the ball. 

But between (0,6) and (1,6), is there a wall? The wall is at 4 steps to the right, which would be (4,6). So from (0,6) to (1,6) is clear. 

Once the ""is"" rule is placed next to the ball, the rule becomes ""ball is win"". Then, moving right to the ball would make the player (being you) touch the win object. 

Alternatively, after creating ""ball is win"", the player can just stand next to the ball and win. 

So the actions needed are:

1. Left (to get the ""is"" rule)
2. Right (to return to original position)
3. Right again (to reach the ball)
4. Place the ""is"" rule next to the ball
5. Then, move right to the ball and win

But how to place the ""is"" rule. In Baba Is You, you place a rule by moving into the adjacent tile with the rule block and the object you want to modify. So if the player is next to the ball and has the ""is"" rule, moving the ""is"" block adjacent to the ball and then making the rule would create ""ball is win"". 

So the exact sequence would be:

- Move left to (-1,6) to get the ""is"" rule.
- Move right to (0,6)
- Move right to (1,6) (the ball)
- Now, the player is at (1,6) with the ""is"" rule. To place it next to the ball, move the ""is"" rule to (2,6) or (0,6), but need to be adjacent to the ball. 

Wait, maybe the player needs to be adjacent to both the ""is"" rule and the ball to create the new rule. Alternatively, when you push the ""is"" rule next to the ball, it attaches to the ball. 

In any case, the key is to move the ""is"" rule to the ball's location and combine them to make ""ball is win"". 

Once that's done, the player can move to the ball and win. 

So the actions would be:

Left (to get the is rule), right, right (to reach the ball), then move the is rule adjacent to the ball. Since the player is carrying the is rule, moving them next to the ball and placing the rule would create the new rule. 

In the game, this would be done by moving the player with the rule block into the tile adjacent to the ball, which would create the ""ball is win"" rule. 

After that, the player can move right to the ball (now a win) and touch it to complete the level. 

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. left (to pick up the is rule)
2. right (back to original position)
3. right (to the ball)
4. move the is rule next to the ball (either left or right, but since the ball is at (1,6), placing the is rule at (2,6) would make ""ball is win"")
5. then move right to the ball (now at (1,6)) and touch it

But in the game, each action is a single step. So the player needs to perform these movements step by step. 

Alternatively, after getting the is rule and being at the ball's position, pushing the is rule to the right (to (2,6)) would create the new rule. Then move right to the ball. 

So the actions would be:

- left (to get is)
- right (back)
- right (to ball)
- right (to place is next to ball)
- right (to ball)

But I need to make sure that the is rule is placed correctly. 

Another possibility: The player is at (0,6), moves left to (-1,6) to get is. Then moves right to (0,6), then right to (1,6) (ball). Now, the player has the is rule. To place it next to the ball, they can move right again to (2,6), placing the is rule there. Then the rule becomes ""ball is win"" (since the ball is at (1,6) and the is rule is at (2,6)), forming ""ball is win"". 

Then the player can move right to (1,6) (the ball) and win. 

So the actions would be:

left, right, right, right, right? Wait, no. Let's recount:

Starting at (0,6):

1. left to (-1,6) (get is)
2. right to (0,6)
3. right to (1,6) (ball)
4. right to (2,6) (place is next to ball)
5. Now, the rule is ""ball is win""
6. Then move right to (1,6) (the ball) to win

But step 5 is moving right again, but after placing the is rule at (2,6), the player is at (2,6). To get to the ball at (1,6), they need to move left once. 

So maybe:

After step 4 (at (2,6)), move left to (1,6) (the ball), then the player is on the ball, which is now a win. 

But the player needs to be a you, which they are, and the ball is win, so touching it would make them win. 

So the sequence would be:

left, right, right, right, left

But that's five actions. However, the game might require each action to be a single step. 

Alternatively, after placing the is rule next to the ball, the player can move left to the ball and win. 

This seems feasible. 

So the final answer is to move left to get the is rule, then navigate to the ball, place the is rule next to it to make ball win, then move to the ball. 

The immediate next action needed is to move left to get the is rule. But in the latest observation, after previous actions, the player might already be at the is rule's position. 

Looking back at the history, the assistant kept alternating between right and left, sometimes failing. The latest observation has the rule `is` 1 step to the left, ball 1 step right, etc. 

Assuming the player is currently at the position of Baba, which is 1 step left and 6 down, then to get the rule `is` 1 step to the left, the player needs to move left once. 

So the next action should be left to grab the is rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other objects by moving their text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right. That's my goal, but I need to get there somehow. The path to the right is blocked by walls and a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which probably makes that wall immovable. 

To the left, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" to combine with ""wall"" or ""you,"" I could change their properties. But right now, the main issue is getting past the walls blocking the path to the right.

Hmm, there's also a ""ball"" at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. If I can make ""ball"" into something else, like ""win,"" that might be a way to reach the win condition. But how? The current ""win"" is a separate rule. Maybe if I move the ""win"" rule to be under the ball, making ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would win. But I need to see if I can move those rules.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""you"" rule to myself or combine it with another object. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba (me) would make me the win condition. That could work. 

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule closer. The ""win"" is 9 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the way. How do I move past them? The walls are defined as ""wall"" with a ""stop"" property. Since ""baba is you,"" and I'm not stopped unless there's a ""stop"" rule affecting me. Wait, the current rules don't have ""baba stop,"" so maybe I can push past the walls? But in Baba Is You, usually, you can move through objects unless they're ""stop."" However, if I'm the ""you,"" maybe I can move through stops? Not sure. Maybe I need to remove the ""stop"" property from the walls.

Looking at the ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can move that rule away or change it, the wall there might become passable. For example, if I move ""stop"" to another object, like making ""ball stop"" instead of ""wall stop,"" then the wall wouldn't be stopped. But how to do that? I would need to move the ""stop"" text block to the ball's position. Let me check the positions.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. The ball is at 8 right, 4 down. So moving ""stop"" to the ball would require pathing there, but there are walls in between. Maybe I can find a way to navigate to the ""stop"" rule first. But getting to 3 right, 3 down is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1, 2, 3 steps down. Those are ""wall"" rules with ""stop"" at 3 right, 3 down. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing ""is"" rules to create a new rule that lets me pass through walls. For instance, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I could move walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""push."" Let's see, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left. If I move that to the wall at 1 left and 1 down, combining ""wall is..."" but I need another property. Maybe ""push"" is somewhere else. Wait, there's no ""push"" rule listed. So that might not be possible.

Another idea: since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can move the ""you"" rule onto myself to reinforce it, but I already have ""baba is you."" Not sure if that helps. What if I make ""baba is win""? Then touching me would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba."" The current ""win"" is 9 steps to the right. To get there, I need to navigate past the walls. Maybe I can use the ""is"" rule to create a bridge or something. 

Looking at the map, there's a ""door"" at 8 right, 3 down. If I can make the door passable, but I don't see a ""key"" or anything. Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used. If I make ""ball is key"" and then ""door is key,"" but again, I don't have a key rule. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left. If I move that ""is"" to the wall at 1 left and 1 down, maybe I can make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you."" But I need to have the property text block. Since the available properties are ""you,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""is,"" ""wall,"" ""door,"" ""ball,"" maybe I can combine them. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule closer by moving the ""is"" block. For example, move the ""is"" from 1 left to next to the ""win"" at 8 right, making ""baba is win"" or something. But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. 

Another approach: since the ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. If I can move that ""you"" rule onto the ""win"" rule, making ""win is you,"" but that wouldn't help unless I'm touching win. 

Wait, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba."" So if I can take the ""win"" rule (which is 9 steps right) and move it near me (1 step left), but there's a wall at 4 steps right blocking the path. How to remove that wall's stop property? If I can move the ""stop"" rule from 3 right, 3 down to somewhere else. For example, move ""stop"" to the ball, making ""ball is stop,"" then the original wall at 4 right, 3 down wouldn't be stopped anymore. Then I could move through it. 

But to do that, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" rule at 3 right, 3 down. Let's see, my current position is probably at the original position of Baba, which might be at 1 step left (since there's a rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down). So I'm at (1 left, 6 down). To reach the ""stop"" at (3 right, 3 down), I need to move right and down. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving right from 1 left to 3 right would require passing through walls at 4 steps right, which are there. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule at 1 step left to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, move ""is"" to combine with ""wall"" and ""push,"" making ""wall is push."" Then I could push the walls out of the way. But I don't have a ""push"" rule. 

Wait, the available text blocks are ""is,"" ""you,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball,"" ""wall."" So maybe I can make ""wall is push"" by moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and then adding ""push."" But there's no ""push"" block on the map. So that's not possible. 

Another angle: the ""door"" is at 8 right, 3 down. If I can make the door passable by changing its rule. For example, ""door is you"" so that stepping on it doesn't stop me. But again, I need to move the ""is"" rule there. 

This is getting complicated. Let me recap. The main goal is to reach the ""win"" at 9 right. The obstacles are walls and a ""stop"" rule. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can move through stops? Or perhaps I need to alter the rules to remove the stop or make the walls passable. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the wall at 3 right, 3 down becomes passable. Then I could path right past the walls. Let's see, the ""stop"" is at 3 right, 3 down. If I move that ""stop"" rule to, say, the ball at 8 right, 4 down, making ""ball is stop,"" then the original wall isn't stopped anymore. Then I could move right past it. 

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. My current position is 1 left, 6 down. To get to 3 right, 3 down, I need to move right 4 times and down 3 times, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, moving right from 1 left to 4 right is blocked by walls at 4 right, 1, 2, 3 down. Unless I can push those walls, which I can't unless they're pushable. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule at 1 left to create a new rule that allows moving through walls. Like ""wall is you,"" but that would make walls act like you, meaning I can move through them. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and ""you."" 

The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 6 down. So if I move the ""is"" block from 1 left to between ""wall"" and ""you,"" making ""wall is you."" Then walls would be passable. But how to get the ""is"" block there? The current ""is"" is at 1 left. I need to move it right to the wall at 1 left, 1 down. Then combine it with ""wall"" and ""you."" 

So steps could be:
1. Move the ""is"" rule from 1 left to 1 left, 1 down (adjacent to the wall).
2. Combine ""is"" with ""wall"" and ""you"" to make ""wall is you.""
3. Now walls are passable, so I can move right past them to reach the ""win"" at 9 right.

But wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left. To move it to the wall at 1 left, 1 down, I need to move down. From 1 left, 6 down, moving down to 1 left, 7 down, then right to 1 left, 1 down? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the positions are relative. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left of something. The initial observation shows ""rule `is` 1 step to the left,"" which might mean it's positioned one step west of another object. Maybe the original Baba's position is near there. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. 

Assuming Baba's starting position is at (0,0), the ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left, so at (-1, 0). The ball is 1 step to the right, so (1, 0). The walls are at 4 steps to the right, so (4,0), and downward. The ""win"" is at (9,0). 

The ""stop"" rule is at (3,3). To get there from (-1,0), I need to move east and south, but obstacles are walls at (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Also, the ""stop"" is at (3,3), which is one step west of (4,3). 

If I can make walls passable by changing their rule to ""you,"" then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to a wall and combine it with ""you."" 

The closest wall to the ""is"" rule at (-1,0) is at (4,0), but that's far away. Alternatively, the wall at (-1,1) (since there's a ""wall 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" which would be (-1,1)). 

So maybe:
1. Move the ""is"" rule from (-1,0) to (-1,1), adjacent to the wall there.
2. Then create the rule ""wall is you,"" making walls passable.
3. Once walls are passable, move right past them to the ""win"" at (9,0).

But how to move the ""is"" rule to (-1,1)? From (-1,0), moving down to (-1,1), which is adjacent to the wall. Then place the ""is"" there. Then combine ""is"" with ""wall"" and ""you"" to make ""wall is you.""

Once that's done, I can walk through all walls, including the ones blocking the path to the ""win."" 

So the steps would be:
- Move down from current position (wherever I am) to reach the ""is"" rule adjacent to the wall.
- Then create ""wall is you.""
- Then move right through the walls to the ""win.""

But I need to confirm the exact positions. The initial observation mentions ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" and ""wall 1 step to the left and 1 step down."" So the wall is at (-1,1), and the ""is"" is at (-1,0). So moving down from the ""is"" position gets me to (-1,1), next to the wall. Then I can create ""wall is you.""

Once that's done, all walls are passable. Then I can move right past the walls at (4,0), etc., to reach the ""win"" at (9,0). 

But the problem is, how do I get to the ""is"" rule in the first place? If my starting position is at Baba's original spot, which is likely near the ""baba"" rule mentioned in the observation: ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" So Baba is at (-1,6). 

From there, to reach the ""is"" rule at (-1,0), I need to move down 6 steps. But there's a wall at (-1,1) which is passable only if we've changed its rule. But initially, walls are stopping. So moving down from (-1,6) to (-1,5), (-1,4), etc., would be blocked by the wall at (-1,1) if it's still a stop. 

This seems tricky. Maybe there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""you,"" maybe I can push the walls if they're pushable. But the rules don't have ""push"" yet. If I can create a ""wall is push"" rule, then I could push them out of the way. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push."" But there's no ""push"" rule on the map. So that's not possible. 

Another idea: use the ball to create a new rule. The ball is at (1,0). If I can make ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. The ""win"" rule is at (9,0), so I need to move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position. 

To move the ""win"" rule from (9,0) to (1,0), I need to path there, but there are walls at (4,0), etc. Unless I can make walls passable. 

So combining previous thoughts: first make walls passable by making ""wall is you,"" then move the ""win"" rule to the ball. 

Steps:
1. Make ""wall is you"" by moving ""is"" next to a wall and ""you.""
2. Move right past walls to the ""win"" rule at (9,0).
3. Move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position at (1,0) by pushing it.
4. Now, touching the ball would make me win.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? Since I'm ""you,"" maybe I can push it. If the ""win"" is a text block, I can move it like any other object, as long as it's not stopped. Once walls are passable, I can move the ""win"" rule left to the ball. 

This seems plausible. 

So the plan is:
- Move the ""is"" rule to a wall and combine it with ""you"" to make ""wall is you.""
- Navigate through passable walls to the ""win"" rule.
- Move the ""win"" rule to the ball's location.
- Now, touching the ball makes me win.

Let's break it down step by step. 

First, locate the ""is"" rule. It's at 1 step to the left of something. Assuming Baba is at (0,0), the ""is"" rule is at (-1,0). The wall at 1 step left and 1 step down is at (-1,1). So moving the ""is"" from (-1,0) down to (-1,1), adjacent to the wall. Then, since ""you"" is at (1,6) (from ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 6 steps down""), which is pretty far away. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 6 steps down, 1 step right. So if I'm at (-1,6), moving right to (0,6), then (1,6) where the ""you"" rule is. But there's a wall at (4,6), but maybe we've made walls passable by then. 

This is getting quite complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to focus on making ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule to Baba's position. 

Baba's rule is at (-1,6) as per ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" The ""win"" rule is at (9,0). To move the ""win"" rule to (-1,6), I need to path there, but there are walls. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at (-1,0) to create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" to (-1,6) to make ""baba is win."" But how to get the ""is"" there? The ""is","

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule 9 steps to the right. But there are also walls blocking the direct path. There's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which probably makes those walls immoveable. The door at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down might be a way through, but how do I open it?

I see a ball at 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move it? But I need to check if the ball has any rules. The closest ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left, which is probably connected to the ""baba"" rule. The ""you"" rule is 6 steps down, which might be linked to the ""baba"" text block that's 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So maybe I can move that ""you"" rule to make myself the win condition?

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. The ""win"" is a separate rule. To win, I need to either reach the ""win"" object or change the rule so that Baba is win. Let me check the available text blocks. There's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" and another ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right."" Maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" to make ""win is you"" or something like that. But how?

Alternatively, the ""ball"" is 1 step to the right. If I can move the ""win"" rule closer, maybe by pushing the ball? But the ball is probably not movable unless there's a rule that says it's pushable. The closest rule is ""baba is you,"" but nothing about the ball. Also, walls are 4 steps to the right, which are stopping me from moving right directly.

Wait, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to get to that door. But how? The door is behind some walls. The ""stop"" rule is blocking the path at 3 steps right and 3 down. Unless I can remove the ""stop"" rule. But to do that, I need to break the existing rule. The ""stop"" rule is part of a ""rule `stop`"" text block. To break it, I might need to move it away or overwrite it with another rule.

Looking at the positions, the ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step left. Maybe I can move that ""is"" block to somewhere else. For example, if I can move it next to the ""stop"" rule, I could create a new rule that makes ""stop"" something else, like making ""stop"" a ""you"" or removing it. But I need to be careful with how the rules are formed.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push the ball. But the ball is 1 step to the right, and I'm at the same position as the ""rule `is`"" 1 step left. Maybe I can move right to get to the ball, then push it towards the door or the win rule. But the walls at 4 steps right might be too far. Let me check the exact positions again.

The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the active rules and objects are listed. The ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" might be where I am currently, since that's a common starting point. So if I move right, I can reach the ball at 1 step right. Then, maybe push the ball further right towards the win rule at 9 steps right. But pushing might require avoiding the walls. The walls at 4 steps right and down could be obstacles.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""win"" equal to something I can reach. For example, if there's a ""rule `is`"" block that I can move next to ""win"" and ""you"" to form ""win is you."" But where is the ""you"" rule? It's at 1 step right and 6 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block toconnect ""win"" and ""you.""

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps to the right could be used. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you,"" that could create ""win is you,"" making me win. But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls and a stop rule. Maybe I need to remove the ""stop"" rule first. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 down. If I can move the ""is"" block there to overwrite it, changing it to something else. For example, turning ""stop"" into a ""push"" or removing it.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""stop"" ineffective. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The key is to either reach the win object or change the rules so that reaching something else counts as winning.

Another idea: The ""ball"" is at 8 steps right and 4 down. If I can make the ball a ""win"" by placing an ""is"" rule next to it and ""win."" So if I move the ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right to be next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" then it would create ""ball is win,"" making the ball the win condition. Then, maybe I can push the ball to reach it.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 8 steps right to be adjacent to both ""ball"" and ""win."" The ""win"" is 9 steps right, so the ""is"" block at 8 steps right would need to be moved one step right to be next to ""win."" But there's a wall at 4 steps right, and the path beyond that is blocked by other walls and the stop rule.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""is"" blocks to reconfigure the rules. For example, the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left could be moved to create a new rule. If I move it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" that would make ""baba is win,"" making me win. But the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down, which is far away.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps down could be moved. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""you"" and ""win,"" that would make ""you is win,"" but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" that would mean ""baba is win."" So maybe moving that ""is"" block.

But how to get to those positions? The player's position isn't clear, but assuming I'm at the ""rule `is`"" 1 step left, moving right towards the ball, then up or down to reach the lower part of the map where the ""you"" rule is.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 6 steps down. If I can move down from my current position (1 step left), maybe there's a path. But there's a wall at 1 step left and 1 step down. So that's blocked. Alternatively, move right to the ball, then down towards the ""you"" rule. But the way is blocked by walls and the stop rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move the ""is"" block next to ""win"" and ""you"" to make ""win is you."" Let's see: the ""win"" is at 9 steps right, and ""you"" is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. That's a bit far. Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right could be moved next to ""win"" and ""you."" But the distance is significant.

Alternatively, use the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left to create a new rule. If I move it to the ball's position (1 step right), then place it next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win."" Then, if I can push the ball to reach it, I win. But moving the ""is"" block from 1 step left to 1 step right would require moving right twice, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, so maybe not.

Wait, the player's starting position might be at the ""rule `is`"" 1 step left. So to move right, I need to go past the ball at 1 step right. But can I move right? There's no wall directly right from my position; the wall is at 4 steps right. So maybe I can move right, then right again, etc., until I reach the ""is"" block at 8 steps right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, which is a stopping point unless I can move it.

But ""wall"" objects are usually immovable unless there's a rule that allows moving them. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" and nothing about walls, I can't push them. So the walls at 4 steps right block the path. Therefore, moving directly right isn't feasible.

Alternative plan: Use the existing rules to change the game rules. For example, make ""stop"" a movable object. If I can create a rule like ""stop is push,"" then the stop rule wouldn't block me. But how to do that? I need to move a text block to create that rule.

The ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right could be moved to the ""stop"" position (3 steps right, 3 down). If I move the ""is"" there, I could write ""stop is push"" or similar. But I need to have the text blocks for ""stop,"" ""is,"" and ""push"" in the right positions.

Alternatively, take the ""is"" block at 1 step left and move it to the ""stop"" rule's position, then create a new rule. But this requires navigating around the walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the ""is"" block at 8 steps right and use it to create a ""win is you"" rule. But how to get there?

Alternatively, focus on the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can open the door, maybe by making it non-stop or removing the stop rule. The door is probably a win condition if I can reach it, but it's behind the stop rule.

Another angle: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push other objects. For example, push the ball towards the win rule. But to push, I need to be adjacent and move in a direction, but the ball might not be pushable unless there's a rule allowing it.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the best action is to move towards the closest movable object, which is the ""is"" block at 1 step left. Wait, but I'm already at the ""is"" block? Or is the ""is"" block 1 step to the left of my current position? If I'm at the ""rule `is`"" 1 step left, then moving right would take me towards the ball. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, so I can't get past that. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" block to a different position to create a new rule.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block at 8 steps right to be next to ""win"" and ""you."" If I can move that ""is"" block leftwards, past the walls, but that's blocked. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move the ""is"" block at 1 step left to be next to ""win"" and ""you."" For example, move the ""is"" block down to the ""you"" rule's position, then create ""you is win."" Since ""baba is you,"" this would make ""baba is win,"" allowing me to win by reaching the ""win"" object.

But how to move the ""is"" block from 1 step left to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 6 steps down. That requires moving right and down multiple times, but the path is blocked by walls and the stop rule.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to prioritize moving the ""is"" block to a more accessible area. For instance, move it from 8 steps right to somewhere between me and the ""win"" rule. But again, the walls are in the way.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 6 steps down to link ""you"" and ""win."" The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, and the ""is"" block is at 6 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" block to be next to both ""you"" and ""win,"" that would create the desired rule. But ""win"" is 9 steps right, which is far from 6 steps down.

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an action, maybe the best immediate move is to move right towards the ball, hoping to find a way to manipulate it or the nearby rules. Alternatively, move down towards the ""you"" rule to attempt creating a new rule there.

But considering the previous failures and the defaulting to idle, I need to make a valid action. Let's try moving right once to get closer to the ball and see if that helps in the next step.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You level. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if any other rules have changed that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" at 8 steps to the right. But between me (Baba) and the win, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and then some other walls further down. Wait, no, actually, the wall is 4 steps to the right, but the ""win"" is 9 steps to the right. So maybe there's a path through other objects?

Wait, the map layout is a bit unclear from the observations, but based on the directions given, I need to figure out where exactly everything is. Let's break it down:

- The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left. Maybe that's a movable text block.
- There's a ball 1 step to the right. Not sure if that's relevant yet.
- Walls are spread out across the map, especially to the right.
- The ""win"" is far to the right at 9 steps, but there's a ""door"" at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and a ""ball"" at 8 steps to the right and 4 steps down.

Hmm, doors might require something to open them. But since I'm Baba and can push things if they're not STOP, maybe I can move the ball or the door? Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So anything labeled STOP can't be moved.

Looking at the rules, there's ""rule `is`"" at different positions. Since I can manipulate rules by moving text blocks, maybe I can change ""baba is you"" to something else. For example, if I make ""you is wall,"" then I wouldn't be controlling Baba anymore. But that's probably counterproductive.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""win is push"" so that pushing the ball towards the win counts as winning. Or ""baba is win"" to make myself the win object. Let's see the current rules:

- ""baba is you"" (active)
- There's a ""rule `is`"" block that I can move. If I move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win,"" maybe create ""baba is win."" That way, I become the win object, and reaching myself would solve the level.

But where is the ""is"" block located? The ""rule `is`"" is 2 steps to the left of my current position. If I move left twice to get to that ""is"" block, then maybe I can pick it up and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form the new rule.

Wait, the current position of Baba is not explicitly stated, but the ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 steps to the left and 6 steps down. So maybe I need to navigate to that area first. Alternatively, if I'm already at that position, I can manipulate the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can reach the ""win"" at 8 steps right by moving past the walls. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, and then more walls down. The door at 7 steps right and 3 steps down might be a way through if I can open it. To open a door, you might need a ""key,"" but there's a ball nearby. If I can push the ball to the door, maybe that's a way. But how?

Wait, the ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. The door is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ball up one step to align with the door, then perhaps the door becomes passable. But to move the ball, I need to be able to push it. Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can push objects unless they're STOP. The ball isn't STOP, so maybe I can push it.

But first, I need to get to the ball. From my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule block at 2 steps left and 6 down), moving right towards the ball would require navigating past walls. There's a wall at 3 steps right, so maybe I have to go around it. Alternatively, use the door at 7 steps right and 3 down, but that's blocked by the stop at 3 steps right and 3 down.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So anything behind that is immovable. So to get past the wall at 3 steps right, I might need to destroy the STOP property. But how? Maybe by changing the rule that makes it STOP.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 3 steps right and 3 down. If I can remove that rule or change it, then the wall behind it (wall at 3 steps right and 1 down) might become movable. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule block. Since I'm allowed to move objects unless they're STOP, and the ""stop"" rule itself isn't STOP (unless there's another rule making it so), I can probably move it.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule block at 3 steps right and 3 down.
2. Move it away to remove the ""stop"" property, making the wall behind it passable.
3. Then proceed past the wall to reach the ball and door.
4. Push the ball onto the door, opening it.
5. Go through the door to the win at 8 steps right.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe create a new rule to make myself win. Since there's a ""rule `is`"" block 2 steps to the left, I can move that to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

Here's how:

1. Move left twice to reach the ""rule `is`"" block.
2. Move it next to ""baba"" (which is at 2 steps left and 6 down) and then next to ""win"" (8 steps right).
3. This would create the rule ""baba is win,"" making me the win object.
4. Then, I just need to stay in place, and the level is solved.

That seems like a quicker solution. So the steps would be:

- Move left to get to the ""is"" block.
- Use the ""is"" block to create ""baba is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba and ""you,"" I can move objects unless they're STOP. The ""is"" block isn't STOP, so I can pick it up and move it.

Assuming my current position is near the ""baba"" rule block, moving left twice would get me to the ""is"" block. Then, moving it towards the ""baba"" and ""win"" objects to form the new rule.

Once that's done, I'm the win, so the level is complete.

Therefore, the best action is to move left to reach the ""is"" block and then manipulate the rules. But since the system requires a single action (idle, up, down, left, right), I need to choose the immediate next action.

Given the current observation, the ""is"" block is 2 steps to the left. So the immediate action should be to move left once to get closer to it. Then, in subsequent steps, move left again, pick up the ""is"" block, and place it to create the new rule.

But in the current observation, the last action was ""left,"" and the previous ones also had left or right movements. The system might be expecting the next step in this sequence.

Alternatively, if the ""is"" block is already nearby, maybe the correct action is to move left again to grab it. But I need to ensure that the action is valid based on the current position and movable objects.

Given the information, the safest immediate action is to move left towards the ""is"" block to position myself to manipulate the rules.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" 9 steps to the right. But there's also a bunch of walls and a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. The ""stop"" makes those walls immovable. I can't go through them. So the path directly right is blocked by walls and a stop.

There's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right. Maybe I can pick up the ball or use it somehow. Also, there's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Doors might be unlocked or require something. The ""ball"" is near the door, maybe pushing it there could do something.

Looking at the lower part, there's another ""is"" rule 6 steps down and ""you"" at 1 step right and 6 steps down. Maybe if I can make ""baba"" into something else, like ""win,"" then touching it would win. But how?

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you."" To change the win condition, maybe I need to create a new rule like ""baba is win."" But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. The ""is"" is 1 step to the left. If I move it next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can form ""baba is win,"" making me win.

But how do I move the ""is"" block? The player (Baba) is at 1 step left and 6 steps down, I think. Wait, no, the player is controlled by Baba, and the position of Baba is probably where the ""baba"" rule is. The ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down"" – so Baba is there. So I need to move that ""baba"" rule? Wait, no. To move objects, they can't be ""stop."" The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But ""is"" rules aren't stop, so maybe I can move them.

So the plan is: move the ""is"" block that's 1 step to the left (near the ball) and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" That way, touching Baba would make him win. Then I can go to where ""win"" is and win.

But how to get to the ""is"" block. The current position of Baba is at the ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" So he's located there. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left of the ball, which is 1 step to the right. Wait, the ""is"" is 1 step to the left. So if Baba is at 1 step left and 6 down, moving left would take him to the ""is"" block. But moving left from his current position (1 left, 6 down) would go to 0 left, 6 down? But need to check the map layout.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" block is in a different location. Let's parse the objects again:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left
- ball 1 step to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right
- ... and others down.

So the ""is"" is 1 step to the left of wherever Baba is. Wait, no. The positions are relative. The ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" is an object's position. So if Baba is at position X, then the ""is"" is 1 step left from X? Or is it absolute? Hmm, the game's coordinate system might be such that each object's position is relative to the player's position. Or maybe absolute based on the level layout. But since the user hasn't provided the actual level map visually, just the relative positions, it's a bit abstract.

Assuming that the ""is"" block is to the left of the player (Baba), then moving left would reach it. Once there, push it onto the ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule.

So steps:

1. Move left to get to the ""is"" block.
2. Push the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win.""
3. Then, since ""baba"" is you and now ""baba is win,"" touching the existing ""win"" object would make you win.

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since the player is Baba, and ""baba is you,"" you can move objects that aren't stopped. The walls are stopped, so you can't move them. The ""is"" block isn't stopped, so you can pick it up and move it.

So first action: move left towards the ""is"" block. Then, once next to it, move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win.""

But in the current observation, the ""is"" is 1 step to the left. So if the player is to the right of that ""is"" block, moving left would reach it.

Looking at the previous actions, the assistant kept moving left and right, but maybe got stuck because the path wasn't clear. Now, in the latest observation, the ""is"" is 1 step to the left. So the correct action is to move left once to reach it, then perhaps move it further.

But the previous attempts resulted in failed actions, maybe because the path wasn't correctly navigated. So the correct action now is to move left to get to the ""is"" block.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You problem. The goal is to reach the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right right now. But how?

First, I need to look at the active rules. The only rule is ""BABA IS YOU,"" which means I can move Baba around and manipulate text blocks. The other objects are walls, a ball, a stop rule, a door, and more walls. The ""win"" is a bit far, but maybe there's a way to get past the walls.

Looking at the objects: there's a rule ""is"" 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move that ""is"" block to create a new rule. If I can make ""BABA IS WIN,"" then I'd become the win condition. But how to do that?

Baba is currently at 1 step to the left of the ""is"" rule. If I move left from there, I can reach the ""is"" block. Wait, but the current position of Baba is 1 step to the left of the ""is"" rule. So if I move left again, I would be next to the ""is"" block. Then, I could push it? But wait, the rules say that objects with ""STOP"" can't be moved. Are there any STOP rules blocking me? The ""stop"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down, which is not in the way horizontally. So maybe I can move the ""is"" block left.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it to combine with ""BABA"" and ""WIN"" to create ""BABA IS WIN."" That way, I would turn into the win object, allowing me to step on it and complete the level. Let's map this out.

Current position of Baba: 1 step to the left of the ""is"" rule. So to get to the ""is"" block, I need to move left once. Then, once I have the ""is"" block, move it to where ""BABA"" and ""WIN"" are. Wait, ""BABA"" is a rule at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. The ""WIN"" rule is 9 steps to the right. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the existing rules. There's a ""you"" rule at 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" and ""BABA IS YOU,"" then stepping on the WIN would work. But how to get the ""WIN"" rule close?

Another thought: the door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can push the door out of the way, maybe by creating a ""STOP"" rule elsewhere. But there's already a ""STOP"" rule at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, the ball is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" block to make ""BALL IS WIN,"" but that wouldn't help unless I'm a ball. But currently, I'm Baba, defined as ""YOU."" Hmm.

Let me focus on the immediate vicinity. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left. If I move left, pick up the ""is"" block, then move right towards the ""WIN"" rule, which is 8 steps to the right. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to create a ""STOP"" rule to block the walls, but that seems counterproductive.

Alternatively, use the ""door"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can make the door passable by changing its property. But the door is a rule as well. If I can create ""DOOR IS YOU,"" but that might not help.

Wait, the key is to create a rule where ""BABA IS WIN."" To do that, I need to have the ""WIN"" text block adjacent to ""BABA"" and the ""IS"" text block. So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""BABA"" and ""WIN,"" then combine them.

Looking at the current setup, ""BABA"" is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. The ""WIN"" is 9 steps to the right. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left. So if I move left to get the ""is"" block, then move down to the ""BABA"" rule, which is at 6 steps down. From there, move right to reach the ""WIN"" rule. But the distance is quite big. Maybe there's a way to push the ""WIN"" rule closer?

Alternatively, use the ""ball"" as a tool. If I can make ""BALL IS WIN,"" then pushing the ball towards the win might work. But again, I need to be able to move the ball, which would require the ""BALL IS YOU"" rule. But currently, I'm ""YOU,"" so maybe I can push the ball.

Wait, but to push the ball, I need to be adjacent to it. The ball is 1 step to the right. So if I move right, I can get next to the ball. But the ball is at 1 step to the right, same row as the ""is"" block. Let me see:

Baba is currently at position where ""is"" is 1 step left. So if I move right, I reach the ball. Then, maybe push the ball to the right towards the ""WIN"" rule. But the ball is 8 steps to the right of the ""WIN"" rule, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, push the ""WIN"" rule left by moving it with the ""is"" block.

Wait, the ""WIN"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move the ""is"" block to be next to ""WIN"" and ""BABA,"" then create the rule. Let's see:

- Move left to get the ""is"" block.
- Then move down to the ""BABA"" rule (6 steps down).
- Move right to where the ""WIN"" rule is (8 steps right). But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 4 steps right. So moving right from the ""BABA"" position (which is at 1 step left and 6 steps down) would require navigating around the walls.

Alternatively, use the ""door"" to create a passage. If I can make the door not a stop, but that's tricky. The ""door"" is a rule, so if I can change its property. But I need an ""IS"" rule to do that.

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

1. Current active rule: BABA IS YOU. So I can move Baba and any text blocks that aren't stopped.

2. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left. If I move left, I can pick it up.

3. Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it to combine with ""BABA"" and ""WIN.""

4. To do that, I need to get the ""WIN"" block closer. But it's 9 steps to the right. Maybe I can move the ""WIN"" block by pushing it with the ""is"" block. But ""WIN"" is a rule, so it's movable unless there's a STOP rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, not affecting the horizontal movement here.

Wait, the ""WIN"" rule is 8 steps to the right. So if I can move it left by 1 step, placing it next to ""BABA,"" then I can create ""BABA IS WIN."" Let's see:

- Move left to get the ""is"" block.
- Move right to the ""WIN"" rule's position (8 steps right).
- Place the ""is"" block next to ""WIN"" and ""BABA.""

But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to remove the walls. But the walls are defined by ""WALL IS STOP"" or similar. Wait, looking at the objects:

There's a rule ""wall"" at 2 steps left and 1 step down. That means ""WALL IS STOP."" So the walls are stopping. To move past them, I need to either make them not stop or find another way.

Alternatively, use the door. The door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can make the door a path by changing its rule. But I need an ""IS"" block for that.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""BABA IS WIN."" Let's try:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block (currently 1 step left).
2. Move right towards the ""WIN"" rule (8 steps right). But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe need to find another route.

Wait, the ""is"" block is 1 step left. If I move left again, I can push the ""is"" block left, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, move down to the ""BABA"" rule (6 steps down) and then move right.

From the ""is"" block at 1 step left, moving down 6 steps would reach the ""BABA"" rule at 1 step left and 6 steps down. Then, moving right from there. But the walls are at 4 steps right, which is in the way. So unless I can remove the walls, that's a problem.

Alternatively, use the ""ball"" to block the walls. If I can make the ball a stop, but I need a rule for that. If I create ""BALL IS STOP,"" then the walls might be pushed aside. But how?

This is getting too convoluted. Let's try a different approach. Since I'm Baba and I can move text blocks, maybe I can create a rule that makes me the win condition.

Current rules: BABA IS YOU. If I can make BABA IS WIN, then stepping on the WIN object would win the level.

To do that, I need to have the ""WIN"" text block adjacent to ""BABA"" and the ""IS"" text block.

The ""WIN"" is 9 steps to the right. ""BABA"" is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left.

So, perhaps:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move down to the ""BABA"" rule (6 steps down).
3. Move right to position the ""is"" block next to ""BABA"" and ""WIN.""

But the distance is too great. Alternatively, move the ""WIN"" block closer.

Wait, the ""WIN"" rule is 8 steps to the right. If I can move it left by 1 step, placing it next to ""BABA,"" then create the rule. To move the ""WIN"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since there's no STOP rule blocking it, I can push it.

So:

1. Move left to get the ""is"" block.
2. Move right to the ""WIN"" rule's position (8 steps right).
3. Move left once to push the ""WIN"" rule one step left.
4. Now, ""WIN"" is at 7 steps right. Still not next to ""BABA.""

Alternatively, keep pushing the ""WIN"" rule left until it's next to ""BABA."" But that would take multiple steps. Let's see:

From the starting position (1 step left of ""is""), move left to get the ""is"" block. Then move right 8 steps to reach the ""WIN"" rule. Then move left 7 steps to push ""WIN"" to 1 step right of ""BABA."" Then place the ""is"" block between them to make ""BABA IS WIN.""

But this requires a lot of movement and avoiding walls. The walls at 4 steps right would be in the way when moving right. So maybe this path is blocked.

Alternative idea: Use the ""door"" to create a path. If I can make the door not a stop, but I need a rule for that. For example, if I create ""DOOR IS YOU,"" but that doesn't help. Alternatively, ""DOOR IS WIN,"" but that would make the door the win condition. Then, pushing the door to reach it.

But this seems off track. Let's refocus.

The key is to create ""BABA IS WIN."" To do that:

- Get the ""is"" block.
- Position it between ""BABA"" and ""WIN.""
- Combine them into a new rule.

Given the current positions:

- ""BABA"" is at (1 left, 6 down)
- ""WIN"" is at (8 right)
- ""is"" is at (1 left)

So the plan is:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move down to (1 left, 6 down) where ""BABA"" is.
3. Move right past the walls at 4 steps right. But how? The walls are stopping. Unless I can make them not stop.

Alternatively, find a way to remove the walls. The walls are defined by ""WALL IS STOP"" (rule at 2 left, 1 down). If I can destroy that rule, the walls become passable. But to destroy a rule, I need to make it not a rule. For example, if I move the ""STOP"" part away.

Wait, the rule ""WALL IS STOP"" is a text block. To destroy it, I need to separate the ""WALL"" and ""STOP"" parts. But I can only move one text block at a time unless they are part of the same rule. Since ""WALL IS STOP"" is a single rule, I can't separate them unless I break the rule.

But in Baba Is You, you can only push text blocks that are not part of an active rule. Wait, no. If a text block is part of an active rule, you can still move it as long as the rule isn't making it immovable. For example, if the rule is ""WALL IS STOP,"" then the WALL text block is STOP, meaning it can't be moved. But the ""STOP"" text block is separate. Wait, no—the rule ""WALL IS STOP"" is a horizontal pair. So the ""WALL"" and ""STOP"" are on the same line. To move either of them, you have to move the entire rule. But you can only move the rule if it's not stopped. Since ""WALL IS STOP"" is a rule, and ""WALL"" is STOP, does that make the entire rule immovable?

This is getting complicated. Let's think: If a text block is defined as STOP, then it can't be moved. So the ""WALL"" in ""WALL IS STOP"" is STOP, meaning that the WALL text block is STOP and can't be moved. However, the ""STOP"" text block in that rule is separate and might be movable unless there's another rule making it STOP.

In this case, the ""STOP"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. So the ""STOP"" text block there is part of the ""STOP IS [something]"" rule? No, looking at the objects, there's a rule ""stop"" 3 steps right and 3 steps down. That might mean ""STOP IS ..."" but the observation doesn't specify. Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" So that's a rule block that says ""STOP IS"" but the property is missing? Or is it a rule that says ""STOP IS [something]?"" The way it's written, maybe it's a partial rule. But typically, rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So the ""rule `stop`..."" might be a rule that's incomplete, but in the game, maybe it's a STOP rule that makes whatever it's applied to stop.

This is unclear. Maybe I should ignore that for now and focus on creating the ""BABA IS WIN"" rule.

Assuming I can move the ""is"" block, here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Move left from Baba's current position (next to ""is"") to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move down to the ""BABA"" rule at (1 left, 6 down).
3. Move right, pushing past the walls at 4 steps right. But how? The walls are STOP, so they can't be moved. Unless I can make them not STOP.

Alternatively, find another path. From the ""BABA"" rule at (1 left, 6 down), moving right, the walls start at 4 steps right. So perhaps there's a way around by moving up or down.

Looking at the map vertically:

- At (1 left, 6 down), moving up or down might reveal a path.

But the observation doesn't specify the vertical layout beyond the mentioned positions. It's possible that moving up or down from the ""BABA"" position could lead to a different area where there are no walls.

Alternatively, use the door at (8 right, 3 down). If I can make the door passable, I might be able to go through it. But to do that, I need to change its rule. For example, ""DOOR IS YOU"" would make me able to go through it. But how?

Alternatively, create ""DOOR IS WIN"" so that stepping on the door wins the game. But I need to be the win condition to that.

This is really tricky. Let's try to prioritize:

The most straightforward solution is to create ""BABA IS WIN."" To do that:

- Get the ""is"" block.
- Place it next to ""BABA"" and ""WIN.""

The challenge is moving the ""is"" block to that position. Given the current layout, the ""is"" block is 1 step left of Baba's starting position. Moving left gets the ""is"" block. Then, from there, move down to the ""BABA"" rule, then right towards the ""WIN"" rule.

But the path is blocked by walls. So perhaps the solution is to first remove the walls by destroying the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""WALL"" or ""STOP"" part away.

The ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is at (2 left, 1 down). So if I can move either the ""WALL"" or ""STOP"" part of that rule, the wall's property changes.

For example, if I move the ""WALL"" part to a different location, then the ""WALL"" would no longer be STOP, making it movable. Similarly, moving the ""STOP"" part would remove the STOP property.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move up or down to reach the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule at (2 left, 1 down).
3. Move the ""WALL"" part of the rule to a different spot, thus destroying the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule.
4. Now, the walls at 4 steps right are no longer STOP, so they can be moved or passed.
5. Then, move to the ""BABA"" and ""WIN"" positions to create ""BABA IS WIN.""

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am Baba. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right. But I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects: There's a ""rule `is`"" 1 step to the left. Maybe I can move that to change a rule. The ball is 1 step to the right, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. There are walls everywhere to the right, except maybe the door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. But the door is a ""rule `door`,"" which I don't know if it's passable.

Wait, there's a ""rule `win`"" at 9 steps right. But moving there directly might be blocked by walls. Let me check the path. To the right, there's a wall at 4 steps right, then another at 4 steps right and 1 down, etc. So perhaps the right path is blocked. Maybe I need to use the ""rule `is`"" to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win would make me win. But how?

The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step left. If I move left to grab that rule, then maybe I can push it somewhere to create a new rule. But I need to be careful not to hit any STOP or WALL properties. The current position has ""baba is you,"" so I can move unless there's a STOP. The walls are 4 steps right, so moving left towards the ""rule `is`"" might be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the ""you"" rule. There's a ""rule `you`"" 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. If I can move that up or somewhere else, but that might not help. Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps down could be used to say ""baba is win"" or something. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks.

Let me think step by step. My current position has a ""rule `is`"" 1 step left. If I move left to pick that up, then I can move it to another location. For example, if I move left, then take the ""is"" rule, then go to where ""baba"" is (1 step left and 6 steps down), and place the ""is"" there to make ""baba is win."" But how do I get there?

Alternatively, maybe I can create ""win is you"" so that touching win makes me you, but I'm already you. Not sure. Alternatively, make ""baba is flag"" or something else, but there's no flag here. The win is the target.

Another approach: The door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down is a rule `door`. If I can make door be passable, but I don't see a rule that defines door's behavior. The current rules are ""baba is you,"" and other rules like wall is stop, stop is wall, etc. So maybe if I can remove the stop property from door, but that would require changing the existing rules.

Wait, the existing rules include ""rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down."" So any object with stop property can't be moved through. The door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, which is under a stop rule. So moving through the door might be blocked unless the stop rule is changed.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away. But to do that, I need to pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it. However, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is a wall. So moving there might be impossible because it's a wall. Unless I can change the wall's property.

Wait, the rule `wall` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can remove the wall property from something. But how?

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- I am Baba (baba is you).
- Goal is to reach win (9 steps right), but path is blocked by walls.
- There's a door at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. Maybe that's a shortcut.
- The ""rule `is`"" is nearby. If I can create a new rule like ""baba is door"" or ""door is you,"" maybe that helps.

Alternatively, if I can make ""win is you,"" then touching win would make me win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""win is you."" For that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""you."" But the ""you"" is at 1 step right and 6 steps down, and ""win"" is at 9 steps right. That's a long distance.

Alternatively, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by placing the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right. So I would need to move the ""is"" rule from left to near baba and win. But that's a lot of movement.

Wait, the current ""rule `is`"" is 1 step to the left. If I move left, take that rule, then move up to the ""baba"" rule at 6 steps down, place the ""is"" there, making ""baba is win"" by combining with the existing ""win"" rule. But the ""win"" rule is 8 steps to the right, which is far away. How to link them?

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps down (next to ""you"") can be used. If I move there and create ""you is win,"" but I'm already you, so that might not help.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move left to grab the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left.
2. Move up to the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 6 steps down.
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""
4. Then, move right to the ""win"" object, which would now make me win since I'm baba and win is me.

But the problem is moving the ""is"" rule from left to the baba location and then to the win location. The movement required would be quite extensive, and there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's check the map again.

Current position: Assuming I'm starting somewhere, but the exact position isn't specified in the observation. The objects are listed relative to my position. For example, ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" means it's to my left. So I'm probably somewhere in the middle.

If I move left to get the ""is"" rule, then perhaps I can push it up to the ""baba"" rule. Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it around. Let's say I move left, take the ""is"" rule, then move up 6 steps to where ""baba"" and ""is"" are (1 step left and 6 down). Place the new ""is"" there to make ""baba is [something]."" But what to pair it with?

The ""win"" is 8 steps to the right. Maybe if I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching win would work. To do that, I need to place ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is at 1 left, 6 down, and ""win"" is at 9 right. So I need to carry the ""is"" rule all the way to near ""baba"" and ""win,"" which might not be feasible due to walls.

Alternatively, maybe create ""win is you"" so that touching win makes me you (which I already am), but that doesn't help. Or ""win is push"" or something else.

Another angle: The door at 8 right, 3 down. If I can make the door not a stop, then I could go through it. But the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. So if I can remove that ""stop"" rule or change it, then the door might be passable. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is nothing"" or similar, but that requires creating a new rule.

This is getting too complex. Let's try a simpler approach. Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push objects. For example, if there's a ball, I can push it. But the goal is to reach win, not push balls.

Wait, the ball is 1 step to the right. If I push it towards the win, but I don't see how that helps. Unless the win is behind the ball, but the win is 9 steps right, and the ball is only 1 step right. So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right can be used. If I can move there and create a new rule. But getting to 8 steps right is blocked by walls. There's a wall at 4 steps right, so I can't go straight right past that.

Wait, the door is at 8 right, 3 down. Maybe I can go down to the door area. Let's see:

From my current position, moving down steps. The map shows walls down to 6 steps down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step right, 6 down. The wall is at 4 steps right, 6 down. So moving down, I might hit walls.

Alternatively, moving right towards the door but blocked by walls. Maybe there's a way around using the ""is"" rules.

Another idea: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless there's a ""stop"" rule. Wait, no. The ""stop"" rule makes objects immovable, but if I'm Baba, can I pass through walls? Normally, in Baba Is You, walls are stop unless rules change them. But the current rules have ""wall is stop,"" so walls are stopping. So I can't move through walls.

Therefore, I need to find a path around the walls or change the rules to make walls passable.

Looking at the rules: ""wall is stop,"" which means walls are stop. If I can change that to ""stop is wall,"" but that doesn't help. Or create a rule like ""baba is push"" to push walls, but there's no such rule.

Alternatively, create ""baba is not stop,"" but how? That would require changing the existing rules.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you,"" ""wall is stop,"" ""stop is wall,"" etc. If I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls would not be stop. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else or destroy it. But in Baba Is You, you can't destroy rules, only move them.

So the ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" is the text block for the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. For example, move it far away so it's no longer affecting the walls.

But how to do that? Let's see:

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 1 left, 1 down. If I move left to grab it, then move it somewhere else, like 10 steps left, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would no longer apply, making walls passable. Then I could go through the walls.

But moving left from my current position: The ""rule `is`"" is 1 step left. If I move left to get that, then move further left to get the ""wall"" rule. Let's try:

1. Move left to get the ""is"" rule (1 step left).
2. Move left again to where the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 down.
3. Take the ""wall"" rule and move it far away, say 10 steps left.
4. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.

Once that's done, I could go around the walls to reach the win object.

But this requires multiple moves and precise steps. Let's see if that's feasible.

First, current position has ""rule `is`"" 1 step left. Move left to get it.

Then, from there, need to move to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 down. That would require moving down 1 step. But can I move down? Are there any STOP properties there?

The objects below are:

At 1 left, 1 down: rule `wall`.

At 4 right, 1 down: wall.

So moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at 0,0), to 0,-1 (down 1), but is there a STOP there? The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 down. So unless there's a stop nearby, I can move down.

Assuming I can move down, then:

1. Move left to get the ""is"" rule.
2. Move down 1 step to reach the ""wall"" rule.
3. Take the ""wall"" rule and move it, say, 10 steps left.
4. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.

Then, move right past the walls at 4 steps right to reach the win at 9 steps right.

This seems like a possible solution. Let's outline the steps:

- Action sequence:
  - left (to get the ""is"" rule)
  - down (to reach the ""wall"" rule)
  - take the ""wall"" rule and move it left multiple times until it's out of the way
  - then move right past the walls to reach the win

But the problem is that each move is individual, and the assistant has to output a single action at a time. The user is asking for the next action based on the current observation.

In the current observation, the active rules are ""baba is you,"" and the objects include the ""is"" rule 1 step left, the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 down, etc.

So the immediate next step would be to move left to get the ""is"" rule. Once that's done, the next step would be to move down to reach the ""wall"" rule.

But according to the latest observation provided, after several left and right actions, the map hasn't changed, which suggests that the previous actions might not have been valid, perhaps because the assistant wasn't able to move the objects as intended.

Wait, in the observations, after the user's previous actions (left, right, etc.), the map remains the same. That suggests that those actions weren't possible, maybe because the assistant tried to move into a wall or a stop object.

So maybe the initial approach was incorrect. Let's reevaluate.

Looking at the latest observation:

Active rules: baba is you

Objects:
- rule `is` 1 step to the left
- ball 1 step to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

Assuming my current position is such that to my left is the ""rule `is`,"" right is the ball, and far right are the walls and win.

If I try to move left, can I? The ""rule `is`"" is a text block, and since I'm ""baba is you,"" and text blocks aren't stop unless specified. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 down, which is a wall. So moving left towards the ""is"" rule should be possible.

So the first valid action would be to move left to pick up the ""is"" rule.

But in previous attempts, the assistant kept getting invalid actions, which might mean that the assumed position was wrong, or the actions weren't correctly mapped.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant needs to push an object. For example, to move the ""is"" rule, you have to be next to it and move in the direction, possibly pushing it if there's space.

In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by being adjacent to them and moving in a direction, which pushes them if there's space. So to get the ""is"" rule 1 step left, the assistant needs to be adjacent to it and move left, pushing it.

Assuming the assistant is one step right of the ""is"" rule, then moving left would take both the assistant and the ""is"" rule one step left.

Once the ""is"" rule is moved, then the assistant can use it to create new rules.

So the correct sequence would be:

1. Move left to push the ""is"" rule to an empty spot.
2. Then, use the moved ""is"" rule to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"" by placing it next to ""baba"" and ""win.""

But where is ""baba"" located? In the objects list, there's ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down."" So ""baba"" is a text block at that position.

So to create ""baba is win,"" the assistant needs to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule.

This requires multiple steps:

- Move the ""is"" rule from left to near the ""baba"" rule.
- Then, move it further to align with the ""win"" rule.

But this is quite involved. Given the current observation, the immediate action should be to move left to grab the ""is"" rule.

However, in the previous attempts, actions like left and right were failing, possibly because the assistant wasn't positioned correctly to move those objects.

Given that the latest valid observation shows the ""is"" rule 1 step left, the correct action is to move left to pick it up and potentially use it to create a new rule.

97,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is 9 steps to the right. But maybe I can manipulate the rules to change what's considered a win.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""ball"" 1 step to the right and another ball 8 steps to the right near a door and walls. There's also a ""win"" rule at 9 steps right. Since I'm Baba, maybe I can move the ""win"" text block to a different location. If I can make the ball the win condition, then touching the ball would win the level.

But how to do that? The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left. If I can move that ""is"" block to combine with ""ball"" and ""win,"" maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is win."" But first, I need to check if I can move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and the rules are ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" block isn't stopped, so I can move it.

So the steps would be: move left to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step left. Then, move right towards the ball at 8 steps right. But wait, there's a wall 4 steps to the right and some stops. Let me check the path. From the current position, moving right 4 steps hits a wall. So maybe I need to find a way around or break the wall by changing its property.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""ball"" and ""win"" blocks. For example, move the ""is"" block to the 8 steps right area where the ball is, then combine ""ball IS win."" That would make the ball the win condition. Once that's done, moving to the ball would let me win.

But how to physically move the blocks? Let me think about the positions. The ""is"" block is 1 step left. If I move left once (already there?), or maybe I need to position myself next to it. Wait, the player (Baba) is presumably at the position where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 1 step left and 6 steps down. So maybe I need to move up or down to get to the ""is"" block.

Wait, the current observation shows that the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. So the player is there. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left, which would be in the same row but left of Baba's position. So if I move left from Baba's position, I can reach the ""is"" block.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I need to move it to the ball at 8 steps right. But moving right from the current position is blocked by walls. The wall is 4 steps to the right. So perhaps I need to remove the wall's property. The wall has a rule ""wall is wall"" at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, maybe I can change the wall's property. But ""wall"" is a property that might be stoppable. Wait, the rules say you can only move objects or text not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is a different area. So maybe the walls can be moved if their rules are changed.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall by being a ""you"" entity. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects that aren't stopped. But the walls are defined as ""wall,"" and if there's a ""stop"" rule, maybe they can't be moved. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a separate object. So if an object is marked as ""stop,"" you can't move it. Let me check the active rules. The active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules are like ""wall is wall,"" ""stop is stop,"" etc., but those are probably in the map as text blocks that can be moved if they're not stopped.

So, to move a wall, I need to first remove its ""wall"" property by moving the corresponding ""wall is wall"" rule. For example, the rule at 1 step left and 1 step down is ""wall is wall."" If I move that rule away, the wall might no longer be a wall. But moving that rule would require navigating to its position.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since I'm Baba and can move, I need to reach the ""is"" block to create new rules. Let's focus on grabbing the ""is"" block. From my current position (1 step left, 6 steps down), moving left takes me to the ""is"" block. So action: left.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it to where the ball is. The ball is at 8 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the wall rules. For example, the ""wall is wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I move that rule, the wall at 4 steps right might become something else. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that makes the wall passable. For example, ""wall is you"" or ""wall is push."" But I need an ""is"" block for that. So first, get the ""is"" block, then move it next to a wall and a property to change its rule.

But this is taking too long. Let's try step by step. Current goal: reach the ""is"" block to create new rules. So action: left to grab it. Then, move right towards the ball, but need to navigate around walls. Maybe move up or down to find a path. But the map layout isn't clear. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block to make the ball the win condition.

If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" then creating ""ball is win"" would make touching the ball win. So, after getting the ""is"" block, move right to the 8 steps right area where the ball and door are. But the way there is blocked by walls. So perhaps push the walls by changing their rules. For example, if I can make the wall a ""stop,"" but that doesn't help. Alternatively, make the wall ""baba"" so I can move it. But I need the ""is"" block for that.

This is tricky. Maybe the fastest way is to move the ""is"" block to the ball and then create ""ball is win."" So steps: move left to get ""is,"" then move right to the ball's location (8 steps right), but path is blocked. Maybe move down or up to find a way around. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 8 steps right. Wait, there's a rule `is` at 8 steps right. So maybe I can use that to create a new rule.

Alternatively, combine the ""is"" block I have with the ball and win. For example, move the ""is"" next to the ball and say ""ball is win."" Then move to the ball to win. But to do that, I need to be able to reach the ball's location.

Given the walls, maybe the best approach is to move the ""is"" block to the 8 steps right area. From the current position (1 step left, 6 steps down), moving right 7 steps would get to 8 steps right, but there are walls at 4 steps right. So perhaps need to move up or down first.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to the 8 steps right `is` rule and combine it with ""ball"" and ""win."" But I'm not sure. Maybe the key is to make the ball the win condition. So grab the ""is"" block, move it to the ball's position, then create ""ball is win."" Once that's done, moving to the ball would make me win.

So action sequence: left to get the nearby ""is"" block, then move right towards the ball, overcoming obstacles by changing wall properties. But how?

Alternatively, since the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, maybe I can move that rule to the ball. But the ball is at 8 steps right. If I can move the ""win"" rule one step left, then touching the ball (now at 8 steps right) would be the win condition. But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to navigate to its position (9 steps right), which is blocked by a wall at 4 steps right. So this seems impossible unless I can remove the walls.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block to the ball and make ""ball is win."" So first, get the ""is"" block by moving left. Then, move right towards the ball, but since the path is blocked, perhaps move down to find a different route. For example, move down to the row where the door and ball are. The door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe there's a path there.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 8 steps right to create a new rule. If I move my ""is"" block there and combine it with ""ball"" and ""win,"" but I'm not sure.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules are text blocks on the map. So to create a new rule, I need to move an ""is"" block next to a subject and property. For example, move ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win.""

So steps: move left to get the ""is"" block at 1 step left. Then move right towards the 8 steps right area where the ball is. But the path is blocked by walls. How to bypass? Maybe push the walls by making them movable. For example, change the ""wall is wall"" rule to something else.

The ""wall is wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. If I can move that rule, say to the 3 steps right and 3 steps down ""stop"" rule, then the wall might become stoppable. Not sure. Alternatively, make the wall a ""you"" so I can move it, but that requires an ""is"" block.

This is really challenging. Maybe the key is to realize that since Baba is you, you can push objects that are not stop. The walls are stoppable, so I can't push them. Therefore, the only way is to change the rules to make the wall passable.

So, grab the ""is"" block, move it to the ""wall is wall"" rule, and change it to ""wall is you"" or ""wall is push."" Then the walls can be moved. Once that's done, push the walls out of the way to reach the ball.

But this requires multiple steps. First, move left to get the ""is"" block. Then move down to the ""wall is wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 down. Move the ""is"" block there and create a new rule like ""wall is you."" Now, the walls are you, meaning I can move them. Then push the walls to clear the path.

But this seems like a lot of steps. The game might expect a simpler solution. Maybe the intended move is to realize that the ball is near a door, and perhaps the door can be opened by changing its rule. But the door's rule is ""door is door"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can change that to ""door is you"" or ""door is win,"" but again, requires an ""is"" block.

Alternatively, since the ball is at 8 steps right, and the ""win"" is at 9 steps right, maybe the solution is to make the ball the win condition. So create ""ball is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to ball and win. But how to reach there.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to move left to get the ""is"" block, then move right towards the ball, overcoming the walls by changing their rules. But in the current observation, after moving left, the next step would be to see if I can move right past the walls. However, the walls are at 4 steps right, so moving right from the ""is"" block's position (1 step left) would require moving right 7 steps to reach 8 steps right, passing through walls at 4 steps right. That's not possible because the walls are in the way.

Hmm. Maybe I need to move down to the area where the door and ball are. From the ""is"" block at 1 step left, moving down to 6 steps down (where the ""you"" rule is) might lead to a path. But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 steps down. So maybe move down and right to reach the ball.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 8 steps right to create a new rule. If I move my ""is"" block there and combine it with ""ball"" and ""win,"" but I'm not sure.

At this point, I think the best action is to move left to get the ""is"" block, then attempt to move right despite the walls, perhaps by pushing them if their rules are changed. But since the walls are stop, I can't push them. Therefore, the only way is to change their rules. So the next step after getting the ""is"" block is to move down to the ""wall is wall"" rule and change it. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler: since ""baba is you,"" you can move the ""win"" rule to the ball. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right. If I can move that rule one step left to the ball's position (8 steps right), then touching the ball would win. But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to navigate there, which is blocked by walls. So this isn't possible unless the walls are removed.

Given all this, maybe the correct action now is to move left to grab the ""is"" block, then move right towards the ball, and if blocked, try to change the wall rules. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. The safest bet might be to move left to get the ""is"" block, then move right, hoping that the path is clear or can be cleared with rule changes.

But in the current observation, after moving left, the next position is the ""is"" block. Then moving right would take me towards the wall at 4 steps right. Since I can't push walls, this is a dead end. Therefore, I need to find another path. Maybe move down to the area where the door and ball are located.

Looking at the objects, the door is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down, and the ball is there too. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can change the ""stop"" rule to allow movement, that might help. But again, this requires an ""is"" block.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""stop"" passable. For example, ""stop is you"" or ""stop is push."" But I need the ""is"" block for that.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, I think the intended solution here is to move left to get the ""is"" block, then move right towards the ball, and once there, create the ""ball is win"" rule. Even though the path is blocked, maybe in the game mechanics, you can push objects or the rules allow overriding.

But considering the game's mechanics, I think the correct approach is to move the ""is"" block to the ball and create ""ball is win."" So the actions would be: left to get the ""is"" block, then right to the ball's location, then create the new rule. However, in the current observation, after moving left, the next step is to see if moving right is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to realize that the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right, and by moving the ""win"" rule left to the ball, making the ball the win condition. But again, the path is blocked.

In the end, the most logical action given the observations and previous failures is to keep moving left to gather the ""is"" block and then find a way to apply it to the ball to change the win condition. So the next action should be left again to get the ""is"" block, or perhaps move in another direction to find a path.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" at 9 steps to the right. But there's also a barrier of walls starting from 4 steps to the right and extending down. The ""stop"" rule at 3 steps right and 3 steps down might block movement past that. Then there's a ""door"" at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to get past the doors or manipulate the rules to bypass obstacles.

There's a ball at 1 step to the right. I remember in Baba Is You, sometimes pushing objects or using them to break rules can help. But right now, the only rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely but can't push other objects unless there's a ""push"" rule or something similar.

Looking further down, at 6 steps down, there's a ""rule baba is you"" and ""rule you"" next to it. Wait, the original rule was ""baba is you,"" but now there's another rule at 6 steps down saying ""baba is you"" again? Maybe that's redundant, but perhaps there's a way to create new rules by moving the ""is"" text block. The ""is"" is 1 step to the left, so if I move it next to ""wall"" or ""ball,"" I can change their properties.

For example, if I move the ""is"" to the left next to ""wall,"" I could make ""wall is stop"" or something else. But right now, moving the ""is"" might help in creating a rule that allows me to move past the walls or reach the ""win"" object. Let's see the positions:

- The ""is"" is 1 step to the left. So if I move left from my current position, I can grab the ""is"" text block. But wait, can I move left? My current position isn't specified, but the ""is"" is 1 step to the left of something else. Assuming I'm adjacent to the ""is"" block, moving left would allow me to pick it up.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it to another object. The ball is 1 step to the right. If I move right to get the ball, but the ball is already at 1 step right. Wait, the ball is an object; can I push it? Since the only rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""push"" or ""move"" rule, I probably can't push it. So maybe I need to use the ""is"" block to create a new rule.

For instance, if I move the ""is"" next to the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right, I could make ""win is you,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, if I make ""baba is win,"" then I could turn into the win object. But how? Let me think.

The existing rules are ""baba is you."" If I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then since I'm Baba, I would become the win object. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But ""baba"" is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. The ""win"" is 9 steps to the right. The distance is quite far. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, looking at the lower part of the map, at 6 steps down, there's a ""rule you"" next to a ""rule is."" Maybe if I can create a ""you"" rule for another object, like the ball, then I could move the ball to the win spot. For example, ""ball is you,"" then I could push the ball (if possible) to the win. But again, without a push rule, I can't push. Unless the ball becomes movable if it's defined as ""you.""

Wait, the current rules don't allow pushing. So maybe the solution is to create a rule that makes a wall or stop into something passable. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is nothing,"" then the walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to the ""wall"" rule and change its property.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left. So if I move left to get the ""is"" block, then move down to the ""wall"" rule, I can rewrite it. Let's see:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move down to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and change its property from ""stop"" to something else, like ""nothing."" So the new rule would be ""wall is nothing,"" making walls passable.

Once that's done, I could move through the walls towards the ""win"" at 9 steps right. But how do I get to the ""win"" without being blocked by the stop at 3 steps right? If walls are passable, then the path from 4 steps right down to 8 steps right might be clear. Let me check the layout:

- There's a ""stop"" at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. If walls are nothing, then the stop is still a problem unless I can change that. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to change ""stop"" to something else.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that makes ""stop"" into ""you"" or ""push,"" but that might be complicated. Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can reach the ""win"" by moving right past the walls. But there are walls at 4 steps right and onwards. If I can make the walls passable, then I can proceed.

So the plan is:

- Grab the ""is"" block.
- Move to the ""wall"" rule and change it to ""wall is nothing.""
- Then move right past the walls to the ""win"" at 9 steps right.

But how to execute this? Let's break it down step by step.

First, my current position isn't specified, but the ""is"" is 1 step to the left. Assuming I'm next to it, I need to move left to pick it up. Then move down to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. But wait, the ""wall"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative. This part is a bit confusing without knowing the exact map layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""is"" block is near the top-left corner, and the walls start at 4 steps right. To reach the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down, I might need to move down from the ""is"" block's position.

Once the walls are passable, moving right past them to the ""win"" should be possible. But there's also a ""door"" at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. If doors require a key, but there's no key mentioned, maybe the door can be opened by changing its rule. The ""door"" rule is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. If I can make ""door is you"" or something, but that might not help. Alternatively, if the door is just a passable object when the rule is changed.

Another angle: the ""ball"" is at 1 step right. If I can make the ball ""win,"" then pushing it to the win spot might work. But again, without a push rule, I can't move the ball. Unless I become the ball by creating a rule like ""baba is ball,"" then I could move as the ball and reach the win. Let's see:

1. Move left to grab ""is.""
2. Move to the ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 6 steps down.
3. Create ""baba is ball,"" making myself the ball.
4. Then move right to the win spot.

But the win is 9 steps right, and I'm at 1 step right as the ball. That's a long way, but possible if there's a clear path. However, there are walls and stops in the way. If I'm the ball, would the stops affect me? If ""ball"" is a movable object, maybe the stops are still there. This might not be the best approach.

Alternatively, creating a ""you"" rule for the win object. If I can make ""win is you,"" then I would turn into the win when standing on it. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right. That seems far, but maybe possible by moving right multiple times after grabbing the ""is.""

Let's outline this step-by-step:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block.
2. Move right multiple times to reach the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""win"" to create ""win is you.""
4. Now, standing on the win object would make me win.

But the problem is the distance. Moving right 8 steps from the initial position (where ""is"" is 1 step left) would require passing through obstacles. The walls at 4 steps right might block this path unless they're made passable.

This seems complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ""is"" block to create a new rule that allows reaching the win. Alternatively, using the existing ""you"" rule at 6 steps down. The ""you"" rule is next to ""baba is you."" If I can create another ""you"" rule for the win, that might work.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you"" and at 6 steps down, there's ""rule you"" 1 step to the right and 6 steps down. Maybe combining these. If I can move the ""is"" block to make ""win is you,"" that would immediately make the win condition be me. But how to place the ""is"" there.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" is 1 step to the left, and the ""win"" is 9 steps right, I'd have to move right 8 times, which is a lot. But maybe there's a shortcut. Looking at the map, after 4 steps right, there are walls down to step 6. The ""door"" is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. Maybe using the door requires a key, but there's no key mentioned. Alternatively, the door could be opened by changing its rule to ""door is nothing.""

But to do any of this, I need to manipulate the rules. The key seems to be grabbing the ""is"" block and using it to create a rule that removes obstacles.

Another possibility: since ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""you"" rule at 6 steps down, maybe I can combine these. If I create a ""you"" rule for the ball, then I could move the ball to the win. But again, without pushing, it's stuck.

Hmm. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""is"" block to create a rule that makes the path to the win clear. Let's say I move the ""is"" to the ""wall"" rule and change it to ""wall is nothing."" Then I can move right past the walls. Let's try to plan the moves:

1. Move left to grab the ""is"" block (current position is unknown, but assuming it's adjacent).
2. Move down to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" to make ""wall is nothing.""
4. Now, move right past the walls at 4 steps right. The path from 4 steps right down to 8 steps right has a ""stop"" at 3 steps right, 3 steps down. But if walls are nothing, the stop is still a problem. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right, 3 steps down. So if I can change that to ""stop is nothing,"" then the stop wouldn't block.

But that requires another round of moving the ""is"" block. Maybe first deal with the walls, then the stop.

Alternatively, after making walls nothing, move right past them to the door at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. If the door is passable, then proceed to the win at 9 steps right.

But how to reach the door? From the starting position, moving right 4 steps would get past the initial walls (now nothing), then continue right to the door. Then move up or down as needed. But the door's position is at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. So from 4 steps right, moving right 4 more steps gets to 8 steps right, then 3 steps down to the door. Then move past the door to the win at 9 steps right.

This seems possible if walls are passable. So the steps would be:

1. Grab ""is"" block by moving left.
2. Change ""wall"" to ""wall is nothing"" by moving down and placing ""is.""
3. Move right past the now-passable walls.
4. Navigate around the door and stop to reach the win.

But the exact sequence of moves needs to be precise. Let's try to outline the actions:

- Initially, the ""is"" is 1 step to the left. Assume I'm adjacent to it.
- Action: left to pick up ""is.""
- Now, move to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step down. Directions needed: down once.
- Action: down.
- Now, place the ""is"" next to ""wall"" to make ""wall is nothing."" How? Maybe move right or left to position the ""is"" between ""wall"" and another word. But the rule is ""rule wall is stop."" To change it, need to rewrite it as ""wall is nothing."" So move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and replace ""stop"" with ""nothing."" This might require moving the ""is"" to the correct position.

Alternatively, the game might allow appending or modifying the rule by moving the ""is"" next to the subject and property. So moving the ""is"" to the end of ""rule wall is stop"" to make ""rule wall is stop is nothing,"" which isn't correct. This part is tricky because I'm not sure how the rule manipulation works in the game's mechanics.

Assuming that placing the ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" allows changing the property, the action would be to move the ""is"" block to the position between ""wall"" and ""stop,"" effectively changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is nothing.""

Once that's done, move right to bypass the walls. The path to the win at 9 steps right should now be clear, except for the door at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. If the door is passable, then moving right to 9 steps would win. If not, need to change the door's rule.

But changing the door's rule would require another ""is"" block, which I've already used. So maybe after making walls passable, the door is still a problem. In that case, need to also change the door's rule to ""door is nothing.""

To do that, after making walls nothing, move to the door's rule at 8 steps right, 3 steps down. Grab another ""is"" block, but there's only one ""is"" block initially. Wait, the initial map has one ""is"" block. So after using it to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is nothing,"" there's no more ""is"" blocks to create new rules. Unless there's another rule that can be split into an ""is"" block.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" and ""rule `is` 8 steps to the right."" So there are two ""is"" blocks? Wait, the initial observation says:

Objects on the map:
rule `is` 1 step to the left
ball 1 step to the right
wall 4 steps to the right
rule `is` 8 steps to the right
...

So there are two ""is"" blocks: one at 1 step left and another at 8 steps right. That's important! I missed that earlier. So I have two ""is"" blocks to work with.

So the plan becomes:

1. Use the first ""is"" block at 1 step left to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is nothing.""
2. Use the second ""is"" block at 8 steps right to change other rules as needed.

Let's execute this:

- Move left to grab the first ""is"" block.
- Move down to the ""wall"" rule and change it to ""wall is nothing.""
- Now, move right to the second ""is"" block at 8 steps right.
- Move to the ""door"" rule at 8 steps right, 3 steps down.
- Place the second ""is"" block to change ""door is [property]"" to ""door is nothing.""
- Now, the door is passable.
- Proceed right to the win at 9 steps right.

This seems feasible. The actions would involve:

1. left (to pick up first ""is"")
2. down (to reach the wall rule)
3. [some movement to place ""is"" and change the rule]
4. right (to move to the second ""is"" at 8 steps right)
5. down (to reach the door rule)
6. [place ""is"" to change door rule]
7. right (to reach win)

But the exact sequence of moves needs to be determined based on the map's layout. However, given the information, the critical actions are moving left to grab the first ""is,"" changing the wall rule, then using the second ""is"" to change the door rule, and finally moving right to the win.

Alternatively, after changing the walls, maybe the path to the win is clear enough without changing the door. Let's check the positions:

- After changing walls to nothing, from the starting point (assuming near the top-left), moving right past 4 steps right (now passable) to 8 steps right, then down to 3 steps down (door) and right to 9 steps right (win). If the door is a stop, but we didn't change it, then moving through the door might be blocked. So changing the door's rule is necessary.

Therefore, the correct sequence would involve both changing the wall and the door rules.

Given that, the chosen action should be to move left to grab the first ""is"" block. But the system requires choosing an action from the list: up, down, left, right, idle. The previous attempts had left and right actions, but the system kept failing. Maybe the issue is not just moving direction but ensuring that the action leads to manipulating the","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: idle

99,left,"<reasoning>
The user is playing Baba Is You, and the assistant needs to figure out the correct action based on the current observation. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever Baba does, the player can control. The objects on the map include a ball to the right, several walls, and a win rule 9 steps to the right.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""is"" 1 step to the left. Maybe that can be moved to change another rule. The ball is 1 step to the right, so maybe moving towards it. However, there are walls blocking the path to the right. The ""win"" rule is far to the right, but there's a door at 8 steps right which might be a way to reach the win point. 

The stop rule at 3 steps right and 3 steps down makes that area immovable. The door at 8 steps right and 3 steps down could be accessed if there's a way to move past the walls. The rule ""baba is you"" is at 1 step left, so if the assistant moves left, they can pick up the ""is"" rule and rearrange the rules. 

The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" the player can manipulate other text blocks. Maybe combining ""baba is you"" with another rule. For example, if they can create ""win is you,"" then touching the win object would win the level. However, currently, ""you"" is defined at 6 steps down, so maybe moving that rule up. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ball and then creating ""ball is you"" or ""win is you."" But the assistant needs to physically move the text blocks. The current position of Baba is not specified, but the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. The assistant needs to navigate to the ""is"" block, pick it up, and move it to modify another rule. 

Since the assistant is defaulting to idle due to previous invalid actions, the correct approach is to move towards the nearest movable object. The ""is"" block is 1 step to the left, so moving left once would allow grabbing it. Then, moving right to place it near the ""win"" or ""ball"" rule to create a new rule. However, the direct path to the right is blocked by walls. The door at 8 steps right might be a key point. 

Alternatively, moving up or down to find a path. The wall 1 step left and 1 step down might be a barrier. But since the assistant can move past non-stop objects, maybe there's a way around. However, the main priority is to manipulate the rules. 

So the step-by-step plan would be: Move left to grab the ""is"" rule, then move right past the walls using the ""baba is you"" ability, place the ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" then go to the win object. But navigating past the walls requires moving through the grid. Given the current observation, moving right 4 steps would hit the wall, so perhaps moving down to find a path. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ball's position to create ""ball is you,"" making the ball controllable. Then pushing the ball towards the win. But the ball is 1 step right, so moving right once would reach it. However, there's a wall at 4 steps right, so need to avoid that. 

Wait, the ball is 1 step to the right of Baba's current position. If Baba can move right once, they can reach the ball. But then what? The ball is a separate object. If the rule is ""baba is you,"" and the ball is just a ball, unless they make ""ball is push"" or ""ball is you,"" they can't do much with it. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ""win"" rule's position. Since ""win"" is 9 steps right, but there's a door at 8 steps right. Maybe rearranging the rules to make ""win is you."" But to do that, the assistant needs to move the ""is"" block next to ""win."" 

Given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action is to move left to grab the ""is"" block, then move right towards the ""win"" rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe moving down to find a different route. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ""you"" rule at 6 steps down to create ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. 

The key is to interact with the text blocks. Since Baba is you, the assistant can move any text block that's not STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, so that area is blocked. 

So, the plan is: Move left to the ""is"" block, pick it up, move right past the walls by using the ability to move over non-stop objects, place the ""is"" next to ""win"" to make ""win is you,"" then go to the win object. 

But how to navigate? The assistant's current position isn't clear, but the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps down. To get to the ""is"" block 1 step left, the assistant needs to move left once. Then move right towards the ""win"" rule at 9 steps right. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe moving down to avoid the walls. 

Alternatively, moving the ""is"" block to the ""ball"" and creating ""ball is win,"" then pushing the ball to the win location. 

This is getting complicated. The safest action based on the last observation is to move left towards the ""is"" block to manipulate the rules. So the action should be ""left.""
