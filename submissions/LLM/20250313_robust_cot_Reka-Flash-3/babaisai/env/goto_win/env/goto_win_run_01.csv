The goal is to reach the ball since it's marked as the WIN object. The active rules are ""ball IS WIN"" and ""BABA IS YOU"". So normally, if I can get to the ball, I win. But I need to check how to move there.

Looking at the objects on the map, I'm BABA, which is the YOU, so I can move. The ball is 1 step to the left of me. Wait, the current observation says ""ball 1 step to the left"". So if I'm at the current position, moving left once should take me to the ball. But let me make sure there aren't any obstacles. The rules don't mention any STOP properties here, so maybe it's straightforward.

Wait, let me check the positions again. The rules for ""ball is win"" are located 4 steps left and 2 up from the ball. The ball itself is 1 step left. But maybe the layout is such that moving left would take me directly to the ball. Since BABA is YOU, I can move freely unless there's a STOP rule. Since the active rules are only ball is win and baba is you, there's no STOP, so moving left should work.

So the best action is to move left once to reach the ball, which is the WIN object. That should solve the level. Let me confirm again: the ball is win, and I'm Baba who is you, so moving left gets me there. Yep, that's the solution.
