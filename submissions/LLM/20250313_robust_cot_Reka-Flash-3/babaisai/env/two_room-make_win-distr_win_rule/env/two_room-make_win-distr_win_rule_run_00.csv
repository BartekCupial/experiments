Let's see. The goal is to reach the OBJECT that is defined as WIN, which right now is the ball. So the ball is the win condition. The active rules are ""ball IS win"" and ""baba IS you"". So as Baba, I can move around.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 3 steps left and 3 steps up from the current position. Then there's a door 2 steps left and 3 steps up. There are several walls around. Also, there are various rule text blocks scattered. The key might be needed to open the door, but I'm not sure yet.

The rule blocks are important here. Since I can move text blocks if they aren't STOP or something, maybe I can rearrange rules to change the properties. For example, if I can make the door WIN instead of the ball, then I could go to the door. Or perhaps make myself (Baba) able to push things or pass through walls.

First, I need to navigate to the key. The key is 3 left and 3 up. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the positions. The wall is 1 step right and 3 up. So if I'm starting somewhere, moving left three times would take me to the key's x-coordinate, but the wall is at 1 right, so maybe that's not blocking the direct path. Wait, the key's position is 3 left and 3 up. So if I move left three times and up three times, will I reach the key? But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up. That might be in a different direction. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player starts at a certain point, perhaps the key is three steps left and three up. The wall at 1 right and 3 up is to the right of that key's position. So if I move left three times from the start, I reach the key's x-coordinate, and then up three, avoiding the wall. But I need to confirm the exact positions.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged such that path to the key is blocked. Let's see. The walls are at various positions: 1 right and 3 up, 1 right and 2 up, 1 right and 1 up, 1 right and 1 down, etc. So if I'm moving left towards the key, the walls to the right might not block that path. But moving up from the key's position could be blocked by other walls.

But the immediate goal is to get the key. However, the door is also there. Maybe the door is locked, requiring the key. So if I pick up the key, I can open the door. But how do I move the key? The key is an object, and I can move it if the rules allow. Since ""baba IS you"", and unless there's a rule that stops me from moving objects, I can pick up the key and move it.

Wait, the rules are ""ball IS win"" and ""baba IS you"". There's no rule that says ""key IS movable"" or ""baba CAN move objects"". But in Baba Is You, typically, you can move objects if you're Baba and there's no STOP rule. Since the active rules here don't have any STOP on objects, I can probably move the key.

So the plan could be: move to the key's location, pick it up, then use it on the door. But to reach the key, I need to navigate through the map. Let's think about the path.

Alternatively, maybe rearranging the rules would be better. For example, if I can make the door WIN instead of the ball, then going to the door would be the solution. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door. The ""win"" rule is located 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So if I can move that text block to the door's position, then the door becomes WIN.

But moving the ""win"" rule requires moving the text block. The ""win"" rule is 6 right, 3 up. To reach it, I need to move right six times and up three. However, there are walls along the way. Let me check the walls' positions.

Walls are at 1 right, 3 up; 1 right, 2 up; 1 right, 1 up; 1 right, 1 down; etc. So moving right from the starting position, after a few steps, there's a wall at 1 right, 3 up. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged in a way that blocks that path. For example, if the starting position is at (0,0), then moving right to (6,3) would require passing through (1,3), which is a wall. So that path is blocked. Therefore, moving the ""win"" rule directly might not be feasible.

Another approach: Maybe make Baba equivalent to the key. If I can say ""baba IS key"", then I can push the key or use it to open the door. But how? To do that, I need to manipulate the ""baba"" rule. The current ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So moving to that position and then rearranging the text blocks.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba IS KEY"" by moving the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""is"" rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, and another ""is"" is at 1 step left. Maybe combining them.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 5 steps right and 3 up, and another ""is"" is 1 step left. The ""baba"" rule is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. To create ""baba IS key"", I need to place ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" in a line. So perhaps move the ""key"" text block to be next to the existing ""baba"" and ""is"" rules.

But how to get there? Let me think about the positions. The ""baba"" rule is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule near it is 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""key"" rule is 4 steps right. So maybe moving right to get to the ""key"" rule, then moving down to reach the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 steps right, so to reach it, I need to move right four times. But there's a wall at 1 step right. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me list them again:

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down

So if I'm moving right from the starting position, after one step right, there's a wall. So I can't go straight right. Therefore, I need to find another path, maybe up or down first.

Alternatively, move up to avoid the wall. For example, move up three steps to get past the walls on the right, then move right. But let's see.

Current position isn't specified, but the objects are positioned relative to the player. Let's assume the player is at (0,0). Then:

- The key is at (-3, 3)
- The door is at (-2, 3)
- The wall at (1,3)
- The ""win"" rule is at (6,3)
- The ""is"" rule is at (5,3) and (-1,0)
- The ""baba"" rule is at (-4, -3)
- The ""key"" rule is at (4,0)
- Etc.

So to reach the key at (-3,3), the player would have to move left three times and up three times. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the walls around that area.

Looking at the walls:

- At (1,3) which is to the right of the starting point.
- There's a wall at (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3). So a vertical wall on the right side starting from (1,3) down to (1,-3).

That means that moving right from (0,0) is blocked at step 1. So to get to the key at (-3,3), the player can move left three times and up three times, avoiding the right-side walls.

So the path would be left, left, left, up, up, up. But need to confirm if there are walls blocking that path. Looking at the walls listed, the only walls in that general area are on the right side. The key's position is left, so moving left should be fine. Up three steps from the starting point (0,0) to (0,3), but the walls are at (1,3) and others, so moving up shouldn't hit walls on the left.

Once at the key's position, the player can pick up the key. Then, move to the door at (-2,3). But the door is at (-2,3), which is two steps left and three up from the starting point. But since the player is already at (-3,3) with the key, moving right once to (-2,3) reaches the door. Then use the key on the door. However, in Baba Is You, to unlock a door, you usually need to be adjacent and have the key. But since the door's rule is ""door IS door"", unless there's a rule that door can be opened by key, which there isn't. So maybe the key doesn't automatically open the door. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe changing the door's property. If the door is a WIN, then reaching it would solve the level. But the current active rule is ""ball IS win"". So unless we change that, the ball remains the win condition.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the door WIN. To do that, we need to move the ""win"" text block to the door's location. The ""win"" rule is at (6,3). To get there, the player would have to move right six times and up three times, but the wall at (1,3) blocks that path. So that's not possible directly.

Another approach: Use the key to manipulate rules. If the key can be made into a tool to create new rules. For example, make ""key IS PUSH"" so that the key can push objects. But to do that, we need to create the rule ""key IS PUSH"" by moving the ""key"", ""is"", and ""push"" text blocks together. However, the ""push"" rule isn't present in the current objects. Looking at the rules listed:

Available rules: 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'key', 'baba', 'you'.

So ""push"" isn't among them. Therefore, can't create that rule.

Alternatively, make the key into a YOU object. If ""key IS YOU"", then the key becomes controllable. But again, that requires creating the rule ""key IS YOU"" by placing the text blocks adjacent.

The ""you"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So to create ""key IS YOU"", we need to move the ""key"" rule (which is at 4 steps right), the ""is"" rule (at 5 steps right or 1 step left), and the ""you"" rule next to each other.

But moving the ""key"" rule from (4,0) to near the ""you"" rule at (-2,-3) would require a lot of steps. Let's see:

From starting position (0,0):

- To reach the ""key"" rule at (4,0), need to move right four times. But there's a wall at (1,0), so moving right once gets to (1,0) which is a wall. Therefore, can't go straight right. So need to find another path.

Alternatively, move up or down first to avoid the wall. For example, move up to (0,1), then right around the wall.

Wait, the walls on the right are from (1,3) down to (1,-3). So moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) is blocked. But moving up to (0,1), then right to (1,1) is also a wall. So (1,1) is a wall. So moving right from (0,1) is blocked. Similarly, moving down to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1) is a wall. So all adjacent right moves from the starting area are blocked.

This complicates movement. Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to find a way to move around the walls on the right by moving up or down first.

For example, move up three times to (0,3), then left to (-3,3) where the key is. Then get the key, move right to (-2,3) where the door is. But the door is part of the level; perhaps the door is locked, requiring the key. But without a ""door IS KEY"" rule, using the key might not work.

Alternatively, change the door's property to WIN. To do that, move the ""win"" rule to the door's location. The ""win"" rule is at (6,3). To get there, need to move right six times and up three, but the wall at (1,3) blocks that. So perhaps move around the wall by going up higher, then right, then down.

Wait, from (0,3), moving right is blocked at (1,3). But if I move up more, say to (0,4), then right to (1,4) (which is not a wall?), then right to (2,4), etc. But the map's layout isn't fully clear. The available objects don't mention walls beyond the ones listed, so maybe there are no walls beyond (1, y) for any y. So moving up past (0,3) and then right might be possible.

So the path could be:

1. Move up three steps to (0,3).
2. Move right past the wall at (1,3) by moving to (0,4), then right to (1,4), then right to (2,4), etc., until reaching (6,4), then down to (6,3) where the ""win"" rule is.
3. Once the ""win"" rule is at the door's location, then the door becomes WIN, and going there would solve the level.

But this requires moving the ""win"" rule, which is possible if there's no STOP rule on it. The active rules don't include ""win IS STOP"", so it's movable.

However, this path requires navigating around the walls on the right. Let's outline the steps:

- From starting position (0,0):
   - Move up three times to (0,3).
   - Move right to (1,3) is blocked by a wall. Instead, move up to (0,4), right to (1,4), right to (2,4), right to (3,4), right to (4,4), right to (5,4), right to (6,4).
   - Then move down to (6,3) to reach the ""win"" rule.
   - Drag the ""win"" rule to the door's location at (-2,3). But how? The player is at (6,4), and the door is at (-2,3). That's a long way left and down. Maybe this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, after moving the ""win"" rule to (6,3), the player would have to move left past the walls on the right. But the walls are from (1,y) down to (1,-3), so moving left from (6,3) would require going around the wall at (1,3). For example, move left to (5,3), (4,3), etc., but need to avoid the wall at (1,3). So maybe moving down to (5,2), left to (4,2), etc., but this is getting complicated.

This approach seems too involved. Perhaps a better strategy is to create a new rule that makes Baba capable of overriding walls or stop properties.

For example, create ""baba IS PUSH"" so that Baba can push objects, including walls. Then push the wall aside to create a path. But to create that rule, need the ""push"" text block. However, ""push"" isn't among the available rules. The available rules are 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'key', 'baba', 'you'. So no ""push"" rule exists.

Alternatively, make ""baba IS NOT STOP"". If there's a ""stop"" rule, but the active rules don't have anything like that. The ""stop"" rule is a text block that can be moved. So if I can create a rule that says ""baba IS NOT STOP"", but that would require the ""not"" text block, which isn't present.

Alternatively, use the existing ""stop"" rule to negate it. But I don't think that's possible in Baba Is You without specific rules.

Another angle: The key is at (4,0). To reach it, the player needs to navigate around the right-side walls. Since moving right is blocked at (1,0), maybe move up first. Let's say:

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Move left to (-1,1).
3. Move down to (-1,0).
4. Move left to (-2,0), etc. But this is just guessing without knowing the exact map layout.

Alternatively, the key is 3 steps left and 3 steps up from the player. So perhaps the player is at (3, -3), and the key is at (0,0). Wait, this is getting confusing without a visual map.

Assuming the player needs to reach the key at (-3,3), the movement would require left three and up three. But the walls on the right might not block that path if the player moves left and up without going near the right side.

Once the key is obtained, moving to the door at (-2,3) and using the key. But how? Maybe the door has a rule that requires a key, which isn't defined here. So unless we create a rule like ""door IS KEY"", the key won't open it. To create that rule, we need the ""key"" text block next to ""door"" and ""is"". The ""door"" rule is at (5,1), and the ""is"" rule is at (5,3) and others. So maybe move the ""key"" rule to be next to ""door"" and ""is"".

Let's see. I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You level where the goal is to make Baba the win object. Right now, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So normally, I would turn into Baba and then try to reach the ball, which is the win object. But how do I move around?

First, I need to check the objects on the map. There's a key somewhere, a door, several walls, and various rule texts. The key is 3 steps left and 3 up from where I am. The door is 2 steps left and 3 up. The walls are blocking some paths. The rule `is` is 5 steps right and 3 up. The `win` rule is 6 steps right and 3 up. Oh, and there are other rules like `wall`, `stop`, `door`, `key`, `baba`, and `is` scattered around.

Since I'm Baba (because ""baba is you""), I can push objects unless they're marked as stop. The walls are probably stop because of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So I can move past them but can't push them. Wait, but the ""wall is stop"" rule means that any object labeled as wall has the stop property. So if I try to move into a wall, it's blocked. But if I can remove or change that rule, maybe I can move through walls.

The main goal is to get to the ball, which is the win object. But right now, the ball is the win, so if I can touch it, I win. But the path might be blocked. Let me visualize the map. From the current position, moving up 3 steps left to the key, then up 3 steps left to the door. The door is 2 steps left and 3 up. Wait, maybe the positions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the object positions again.

The key is 3 steps left and 3 up. The door is 2 steps left and 3 up. So the door is to the right of the key. There's a wall 1 step right and 3 up. So between the door and me (assuming I start at a certain point), there's a wall. Then further right, there are more walls and rules. The `is` rule is 5 steps right and 3 up, which is probably important because creating new rules requires moving the `is` text. The `win` rule is 6 steps right and 3 up. That's where the ball is, I think.

To create a new rule, I need to combine two texts with an `is`. For example, if I move the `baba` text next to the `win` text with an `is`, I could make ""baba is win"". Then I would be the win object. But how do I get those texts to the right where the `is` is?

First, I need to navigate to the `is` rule. It's 5 steps right and 3 up. But the path there might be blocked. Let's see. From my current position, moving right 5 steps would take me to the `is` rule at 5 steps right and 3 up. But along the way, there are walls. Specifically, a wall is 1 step right, and another at 1 step right and 2/1/3 steps up. So moving right directly might hit the wall at 1 step right. So I need to find a way around that.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first. Let me think. If I move up 3 steps, then right 5 steps, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up. So moving up 3 first would place me at the same vertical level as the wall. Then moving right would hit the wall. That's a problem.

Wait, maybe there's another path. Let's check the other walls. There's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up, another at 1 step right and 2 up, 1 step up, and so on down to 3 steps down. So the right side has a vertical wall from 3 up to 3 down, except maybe at the bottom. So to get to the `is` rule at 5 right and 3 up, I need to go around that wall. How?

Perhaps moving up first, then left around the walls. But the key and door are to the left. Maybe instead of going right, I can go left towards the key and door. The key is 3 left and 3 up. If I go left 3 steps, then up 3, I get to the key. But the door is 2 left and 3 up, so maybe that's on the way. However, the door requires a key to open, I assume. But I don't have the key yet. The key is 3 left and 3 up. So to get the key, I need to move there. But moving left 3 steps from my current position would reach the key. But the path might be blocked.

Wait, the current active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So as Baba, I can move unless I hit a STOP object. The walls are stop, so moving into them is blocked. Let me see the positions again:

Key: 3 left, 3 up.

Door: 2 left, 3 up.

Wall: 1 right, 3 up.

So from my starting position, if I move left 3 steps, I reach the key. But between me and the key, there's nothing blocking because the walls are to the right. So moving left three times would get me to the key. Once I have the key, maybe I can open the door. But the door is 2 left, 3 up, which is between me and the key. Wait, no: if the key is 3 left and 3 up, and the door is 2 left and 3 up, then the door is to the right of the key. So moving left 3 steps would take me past the door (which is at 2 left, 3 up) to the key at 3 left, 3 up.

But the door is there. Since the door's rule is ""rule door 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"", that means the door is an object that is a door, and perhaps there's a rule that door is stop or something else. Wait, looking at the active rules, there's ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So the door object is present at that position, but the active rules don't specify that door is stop. Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""wall is stop"" are in the object list as rule blocks, but they might not be active unless they're part of the current rules.

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the active rules are the ones that are formed by text blocks. So if there's a text block saying ""wall is stop"", then that's an active rule. But in the current observation, the active rules listed are only ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rule blocks like ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up"" are just objects on the map, not active rules unless they are connected by an ""is"" text.

So the walls are present as objects, but their properties are determined by the active rules. Since ""wall is stop"" is not an active rule right now, the walls might not be stop. Wait, that's confusing. Let me recall: in Baba Is You, when a text block says ""[Subject] IS [Property]"", that's an active rule. So if there's a wall object and a text block saying ""wall is stop"", then walls are stop. But if the ""wall is stop"" text block is not present as an active rule (i.e., not connected by an ""is"" text), then walls have their default properties.

Wait, no. All the rule text blocks on the map are potential rules. So for example, if there's a text block ""wall is stop"" somewhere on the map, then that's an active rule. But in the current observation, the active rules listed are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rule text blocks (like ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up"") are just rule objects placed on the map but not connected to an ""is"" text, so they don't form active rules. Therefore, the walls present on the map don't have the ""stop"" property unless there's an active rule ""wall is stop"". Looking at the active rules, there's none saying ""wall is stop"", so the walls are passable.

Wait, that's a key point. The active rules are only the ones that are properly formed by text blocks connected by ""is"". So in the current observation, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rule blocks like ""rule `wall`..."" are just objects on the map but don't create active rules unless they are part of a rule (i.e., next to an ""is"" text).

Therefore, the walls on the map are not stop unless there's an active rule making them so. Since there's no active ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move through the walls. That's a game-changer. So earlier assumption that walls are stop was wrong. So the walls are just regular objects, and I can push them or move around them.

So the wall at 1 step right and 3 up is just a wall object, not a stop. So I can move past it. That opens up more movement options.

So my plan: move to the `is` rule at 5 steps right and 3 up to create new rules. To do that, I need to navigate there. Let's see the path.

From my current position (unknown exactly, but based on the objects listed, perhaps I'm near the bottom left?), I need to move right towards the `is` at 5 right, 3 up. But there's a wall at 1 right, 3 up. Wait, but walls are not stop, so I can move past them. So moving right past the wall at 1 step right, 3 up. Then continue right to 5 steps.

Alternatively, maybe moving up first. Let's check the positions again.

The `is` rule is at 5 right, 3 up. So from my current position, moving right 5 steps and up 3 would get there. But along the way, at 1 right, 3 up there's a wall. Since walls are not stop, I can move past it. So right 1, then right 4 more steps to reach 5 right. Then up 3 steps to reach the `is` rule.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's see other objects. The `win` rule is at 6 right, 3 up. The `ball` is probably at that position since ""ball is win"". So to get to the ball, I need to go right past the `is` and `win` rules.

Once I have the `is` rule, I can create a new rule. For example, if I can get the `baba` text next to the `win` text with an `is`, then ""baba is win"" becomes active, making me the win object.

The `baba` rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So to get there, I need to move left 4 steps and down 3 steps. But that's the opposite direction of the `is` rule. Maybe after creating a rule at the `is` position, I can move to the `baba` rule.

But first, how to reach the `is` rule at 5 right, 3 up. Let's outline the path step by step.

Current position: Let's assume I'm at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- The `is` rule is at (5,3).
- The wall at (1,3).
- The `win` rule at (6,3).
- The `ball` is at (6,3) as per ""ball is win"".
- The `baba` rule is at (-4,-3).
- The `you` rule is at (-2,-3).

So to get to (5,3), I need to move right 5 steps from (0,0), but there's a wall at (1,3). Since the wall is not stop, I can move right past it. So:

1. Move right to (1,3) – there's a wall here, but can I move through it? Since walls are not stop, yes.
2. Continue moving right to (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) – reach the `is` rule.

Once at (5,3), the `is` rule is there. Now, I need to use this `is` to create a new rule. For example, combine `baba` with `win` using `is`.

But to do that, I need to move the `baba` text (which is at (-4,-3)) next to the `is` and `win` texts. That's quite a distance. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer `baba` text. Wait, looking at the objects:

The `rule `baba`` is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So (-4, -3). The `rule `you`` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down (-2, -3). The `is` rule is at (5,3). The `win` is at (6,3).

So the plan is:

1. Move to the `is` rule at (5,3).
2. Then, find the `baba` rule at (-4,-3) and bring it to near the `win` rule at (6,3) so that ""baba is win"" can be formed.

But that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think differently.

Another approach: since the key is at 3 left, 3 up, maybe grabbing the key allows me to open the door. The door is at 2 left, 3 up. If I have the key, I can push the door or move it? Wait, doors in Baba Is You can be pushed if they are not stop. If the door is a stop, then I can't. But since there's no active rule making door stop, I can push it. But the door is at ( -2,3 ), assuming my current position is (0,0). The key is at (-3,3). So moving left 3 steps to get the key, then left another step to the door, use the key to open it. But how does the key work? In Baba Is You, usually, a key is used to unlock a door, which might involve moving the key to the door's position. But I'm not sure how that works here.

Alternatively, once I have the key, maybe I can move it to the door and then the door becomes passage. But I need to check the level mechanics. If the door is a separate object, and there's a rule ""key is win"" or something, but in this case, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"".

Alternatively, maybe after getting the key, I can use it to create a new rule. For example, move the `key` rule to the `is` position to make a rule like ""key is you"" or something. But I'm not sure.

Let me focus back on getting to the `is` rule. Since moving right past the wall at (1,3) is possible, I can proceed:

Action sequence:

1. right (1 step to (1,3) – wall, but can pass)
2. right (2)
3. right (3)
4. right (4)
5. right (5) – reach `is` at (5,3)

Now at (5,3) with the `is` rule. Now, I need to create a new rule. Let's say I want to make ""baba is win"". To do that, I need the `baba` text next to `win` and `is`.

The `baba` rule is at (-4,-3), which is far left and down. The `win` rule is at (6,3). So moving from (5,3) to (6,3) gets me next to `win`. Then I need to get the `baba` text here.

But how? The `baba` text is at (-4,-3). I would have to move left 4 steps and down 3 steps, which is a long way. Alternatively, maybe there's another `baba` text. Wait, looking at the objects:

There's a `rule `baba`` at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. Also, the `you` rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. The `is` rule is at 5 right and 3 up. The `win` is at 6 right and 3 up.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that makes ""baba is you"" into ""you is win"", but that might not help.

Wait, the current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So as Baba, I'm the ""you"" object. So if I can make ""you is win"", then I would still be win. But I'm already ""you"", so maybe that's redundant.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by placing `baba`, `is`, `win` together.

But to get the `baba` text to (5,3) area, I need to move it. Since `baba` is at (-4,-3), moving right 9 steps and up 6 steps would get there, which is impractical.

Another idea: use the `key` to create a new rule. The key is at (-3,3). If I can get the key to the `is` position, maybe combine it with other texts. For example, ""key is win"", but the ball is already win. Not sure.

Alternatively, make ""rule is you"" or something. But not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can create a rule that makes ""is"" a different property. For example, ""is is push"" or something, but that might not help.

Alternatively, make ""wall is not stop"" by redefining the rule. But there's no active ""wall is stop"" rule, so walls are passable. So that's not necessary.

Another approach: since the goal is to reach the ball (which is win), maybe I can push the ball to me. But ball is an object, and unless there's a rule that allows pushing it, I can't. The default is that you can push objects unless they are stop. Since there's no ""ball is stop"" rule, I can push the ball. But how?

Let's see. I need to figure out how to win this level in Baba Is You. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"", which means I control Baba and the goal is to reach the ball.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 3 steps left and 3 up from my current position. The door is 2 steps left and 3 up. Wall is 1 step right and 3 up. There are some rules scattered around, like ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""key"", ""ball"", ""baba"", and ""you"". 

The problem is that the door is blocking the path to the key and the ball. To get through the door, I might need to change the rule that makes the door a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 up. But how do I reach it? My current position isn't clear, but I can probably navigate based on the rules' positions. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule out of the way or change it, the door might no longer be a stop. For example, if I make ""door"" something else, like ""push"" or remove the ""stop"" property. But since ""baba is you"", I can move the text blocks. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up"". To reach that, I might need to go left and up. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up. Wait, maybe I can use other rules. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the door not a stop. For example, if I move ""door"" next to ""is"" and ""push"", but I don't have a ""push"" rule. Wait, the available rules are ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""key"", ""ball"", ""baba"", ""you"". 

If I can make ""door is push"", that might let me push it. But how? Let me check the positions. The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 5 steps right and 3 step up. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule next to an ""is"" and another property. 

Wait, the ""rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"" is there. If I can move the ""door"" rule to be adjacent to that ""is"" and another rule, like ""push"", but I don't have a ""push"" rule. Alternatively, use an existing rule. Maybe ""key"" or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe change the ""stop"" rule to something else. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the door might not be stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. But can I? The walls are nearby, so maybe the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""door"" not stop. For example, ""door is not stop"", but the game doesn't support negation. So maybe ""door is key"" or another property. If I can move the ""door"" rule next to an ""is"" and a different property, like ""key"", then the rule would be ""door is key"", making the door a key. But then the key is already there. 

Wait, the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe if I get the key, I can use it on the door. But the door is 2 left and 3 up. So the path to the key is blocked by the door. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe change the ""win"" rule. The current win is the ball. If I can change that to the door, then reaching the door would win. But the door is blocked. So that's not helpful. 

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I need to reach the ball. The ball is 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 1 step right, then another wall at 1 step right and 1 up, etc. Let me visualize the map. 

Assuming I'm at the starting position near the bottom. The walls are creating a barrier. The ""rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"" is there. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with other rules. For example, if I move ""ball"" next to ""is"" and ""you"", making ""ball is you"", then I could become the ball and walk over the walls. 

But the ""you"" rule is at 2 left and 3 down. To get there, I need to move left and down. But there are walls in the way. The rule `you` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So maybe I can move that ""you"" rule to a different position. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""baba is you"" to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba, I can move any object that's not stopped. The walls are stopped because of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So I can't move walls. But I can move the rules, keys, etc., as long as they're not stopped. 

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule away, or change the door's property. Let's try changing the door's property. The door's rule is at 5 right and 1 up. If I can move that next to an ""is"" and another rule, like ""push"", but I don't have ""push"". Alternatively, ""key"" or ""win"". 

Wait, the ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"" can be moved. If I move it next to the ""is"" at 5 right and 3 up, and then another rule, say ""key"" at 6 right and 1 down, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, move the ""door"" rule to be adjacent to ""is"" and ""win"", making ""door is win"". Then the door becomes the win condition. But the door is blocked. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the key is needed. The key is at 6 right and 1 down. To get there, I need to move right past the walls. But the walls are stopped. Unless I can change the wall's property. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left and 2 up. If I can remove that, walls would no longer be stop. 

So, move the ""wall"" rule (at 4 left and 2 up) to another position. For example, move it away so the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken. Then walls would be normal, and I can push them or walk through. 

But how to move that ""wall"" rule. Since I'm Baba, I can move objects not defined as stop. The walls are stop, but the rules themselves are not necessarily stop unless specified. The ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up"" is a text block. Since ""wall is stop"", but the rule text itself is not a wall, so can I move it? 

Yes, because the rule says ""wall is stop"", but the rule text ""wall"" is a separate object. So I can move the ""rule `wall`"" text block. If I move it away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer on the board, so walls won't be stop anymore. 

So the plan is: move the ""rule `wall`"" at 4 left and 2 up to a different position, thereby removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them. 

Once walls are no longer stop, I can navigate to the key, pick it up, and then use it on the door. But the door is a door, and doors are usually stopped unless there's a rule saying otherwise. Wait, the current rules are ""door is door"" (implicitly) unless changed. But if I can change the door's rule, maybe to ""door is push"" or ""door is key"", but I don't have those rules. 

Alternatively, once walls are no longer stop, I can move around them and get to the door. Then, since the door is a door, maybe there's a rule that says ""door is stop"", but if that rule is removed, then the door isn't stop. Wait, the original rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's no explicit ""door is stop"" rule, unless the ""stop"" rule is applied to door. Wait, looking at the active rules, there's ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up"". That's the stop rule. But how does that apply to objects? The game typically applies rules based on proximity. So if an object is next to a rule that defines its property, then it has that property. 

So, the door is at 2 left and 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 2 up. So the door is adjacent to the stop rule, meaning the door has the stop property. Therefore, to remove the stop property from the door, I need to move either the door or the stop rule so they're not adjacent anymore. 

The stop rule is at 2 left and 2 up. If I can move that rule away, then the door won't be adjacent to it anymore, so it won't have the stop property. 

So the steps would be: 

1. Move the ""rule `stop`"" from 2 left 2 up to a different position. 
2. Then, the door is no longer stopped, so I can move through it. 
3. Navigate to the key, pick it up (if needed), and go to the ball. 

But how to move the ""rule `stop`""? Let's check where it is. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 left and 2 up. My current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm near Baba's starting position, which is at ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down"". So Baba is at 4 left, 3 down. 

The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 left, 2 up. Starting from Baba's position (4 left, 3 down), to get to 2 left, 2 up, I need to move left twice and up once. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up. Wait, maybe the path is blocked. Let me map this out. 

From Baba's position (4L, 3D):

To reach 2L, 2U:

Left once to 3L, 3D.

Left again to 2L, 3D.

Up once to 2L, 2D.

Up once more to 2L, 2U (the stop rule). 

But along the way, are there any walls? Let's check the objects:

- At 1 step right and 3 up: wall.
- So moving from 4L,3D to 2L,2U:

From 4L,3D to 3L,3D: possible, no walls mentioned there.

3L,3D to 2L,3D: possible.

2L,3D to 2L,2D: possible.

2L,2D to 2L,2U: yes, that's where the stop rule is. 

But can I move through the walls? Wait, the walls are at 1R,3U and others. So moving left from 4L to 2L is possible since those positions don't have walls. Once I reach 2L,2U, which is the stop rule, I can pick it up and move it elsewhere. 

So the action would be to move the ""rule `stop`"" text block. To do that, I need to move it adjacent to another rule, perhaps combining it into a new rule. For example, moving it next to ""rule `is`"" and another property to create a new rule like ""stop is win"" or something. But the goal is to remove the ""stop"" rule's effect on the door. 

Alternatively, just move the ""rule `stop`"" away from the door. Since the door is at 2L,3U and the stop rule is at 2L,2U, if I move the stop rule down to 2L,1U, then the door is no longer adjacent to it, so it won't have the stop property. 

So the action would be to take the ""rule `stop`"" at 2L,2U and move it down one step to 2L,1U. 

But how to express this in the action? The available actions are up, down, left, right, idle. 

Assuming the agent is at the position of Baba, which is at ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down"". So the coordinates might be relative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move towards the ""rule `stop`"" and then move it in a direction. But the problem is that the action commands are simple movement, not manipulating text blocks directly. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, to move a text block, you have to push it by moving into it while being the 'you' or 'push' subject. Since the current rules are ""baba is you"", I can move any object that's not stopped. The text blocks are objects, but they are affected by rules. 

The ""rule `stop`"" text block is a separate object. Since it's not defined as stop (unless there's a rule saying rule is stop), but the ""wall is stop"" rule applies to walls. So the text blocks themselves are movable unless there's a rule preventing it. 

So to move the ""rule `stop`"", I can move left or right from its current position (2L,2U). The action would be to move left or right to get next to it and then move it. 

But the available actions are only up, down, left, right, idle. So the agent can't directly say ""pick up rule stop and move it down"". It has to move towards the rule and then in the direction to push it. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (4L,3D) to the location of ""rule `stop`"" at 2L,2U. 

To do that:

From 4L,3D:

Move left once to 3L,3D.

Move left again to 2L,3D.

Move up once to 2L,2D.

Move up once to 2L,2U (where the stop rule is).

Now, to move the stop rule, since I'm adjacent to it, I can push it in a direction. For example, move down from 2L,2U to 2L,1U, pushing the stop rule there. 

So the action sequence would be:

Move left, left, up, up (to reach 2L,2U).

Then move down (to push the stop rule to 2L,1U).

This would remove the ""stop"" rule's adjacency to the door, making the door not stop. 

Once that's done, the door can be passed. Then navigate to the key, pick it up (if needed), and go to the ball. 

But the key is at 6R,1D. So from 2L,1U, moving right multiple times. But there are walls at 1R,3U and others. However, if walls are no longer stop, then they can be moved past. 

Alternatively, after removing the ""stop"" rule, the walls are just normal objects, so I can walk through them. 

So the first action is to move the stop rule out of the way. The correct action would be to move down from the stop rule's position to push it down. 

But how to express this in the allowed actions. The agent can only choose up, down, left, right, or idle. 

So assuming the agent is at 2L,2U (the stop rule's location), the action would be to move down, which would push the stop rule to 2L,1U. 

Therefore, the chosen action is ""down"".

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to make Baba be the Win object, but in this case, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So normally, the player is Baba, and the goal is to touch the ball because it's defined as Win.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 3 steps left and 4 steps up from where I assume the player (Baba) starts. The door is 2 steps left and 4 up, which might require the key. There are walls around, some with rules like 'wall is stop', which means touching them is blocked. The 'is' rule texts are scattered, which I can potentially move to change the game rules.

The player is Baba, and since ""baba is you"", moving Baba around is possible. The main challenge is getting past the walls and the door. The key is probably needed to open the door. But how do I reach the key? The key is 3 steps left and 4 up. Let's see the layout:

- The key is to the left and above. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 4 steps left and 3 up, there's a wall that's a 'stop', which can't be moved through. Also, there's a rule 'wall' at 4 left and 2 up, which might mean that certain tiles are walls.

Wait, the rules include ""wall is stop"", so any object named 'wall' has the 'stop' property. So those walls are immovable. To get past them, maybe I can change the rules. The 'is' rule blocks are important here. If I can move an 'is' block next to another rule, I can change the definitions.

Looking at the current position of the rules:

- There's a rule 'is' at 5 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I can move that to connect with another rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by placing 'is' between 'baba' and 'win', then I could win by touching Baba. But where is Baba located? The 'rule baba' is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So Baba is an object on the map, maybe at that position. To move Baba, since ""baba is you"", I can move the Baba object around.

Wait, the player is controlled by the 'you' rule, which is currently attached to Baba. So to move, I need to move the Baba object. The key is at 3 left, 4 up. The door is at 2 left, 4 up. There's a wall to the right at 1 step right and 3 up, which is a stop. So moving right would hit that wall. The path to the key might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the map:

Assuming the player starts at a certain position, maybe near the lower center. The key is up and left. Let's see:

- To get to the key (3 left, 4 up), the player would need to move left 3 times and up 4 times. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 left and 3 up, there's a wall that's a stop. Also, at 2 left and 2 up, there's another stop wall. So the direct path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change the rules to bypass the walls. The 'is' rule at 5 right and 4 up could be moved. If I can move that 'is' to connect with 'wall' and change its property, but 'wall is stop' is another rule. If I can break that rule by moving 'is' away, then maybe walls aren't stops anymore. But how?

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule like 'baba is key' so that Baba can pick up the key. But I don't have a key rule yet. The 'key' rule is at 6 right and 1 down. So if I can move that 'key' rule next to 'baba' and 'is', that could work. For example, moving the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key' to make ""baba is key"". Then, moving Baba (since he's you) towards the key and picking it up, then using it on the door. But the door's rule is 'door is door', which might not be stop unless there's a 'stop' rule on it. Wait, the 'door' rule is at 5 right and 1 up, which is ""door is door"". The 'stop' rule is at 2 left and 2 up, which is ""wall is stop"". So doors are not stop unless they have the stop property. But the door here might just be a normal door that requires the key.

Alternatively, the goal is to touch the ball, which is win. But the ball is 4 steps right and 1 step up. To reach it, the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the path to the ball. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. From the player's starting position, maybe moving right and up. But there's a wall at 1 right, which is a stop. So moving right directly is blocked. There's another 'is' rule at 1 left, which could be used to modify rules.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to change ""ball is win"" to something else. But the player needs to be able to reach the ball. Alternatively, make Baba win by redefining the rules. For example, move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win' to make ""baba is win"". That way, touching Baba (yourself) would make you win. But where is the 'win' rule? It's at 6 right and 4 up. So to create ""baba is win"", you need to place 'baba', 'is', and 'win' in order. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left and 3 down, the 'is' is at 3 left and 3 down, and the 'win' is at 6 right and 4 up. That seems far apart. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, use the 'key' to open the door. The key is at 6 right and 1 down. To get the key, you might need to move right past the walls. But the wall at 1 right is a stop. So how to get past? Maybe by changing the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move the 'is' block that's part of 'wall is stop' away, then walls wouldn't be stops. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left and 2 up. The 'is' there is at 4 left and 2 up. If I can move that 'is' block, maybe to another position, then the rule would break. For example, moving the 'is' from 4 left 2 up to somewhere else, making the rule invalid. Then, walls wouldn't be stop, allowing passage.

But to move the 'is' block, I need to be able to move objects that are not stop. The current rules have ""baba is you"", so I can move Baba. The 'is' blocks are objects, so are they movable? The rules don't specify that 'is' is stop, so they can be moved. So perhaps I can move the 'is' block at 4 left 2 up to another location, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule. Then, walls are no longer stop, and I can move through them.

Once walls are not stops, I can navigate to the key, pick it up (if possible), open the door, and reach the ball. But how to pick up the key? If I make ""baba is key"", then touching the key would make Baba key, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, if I can move the key to the ball, but that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, after removing the 'wall is stop' rule, I can move around freely. Let's outline steps:

1. Move to the 'is' block at 4 left 2 up (part of 'wall is stop') and move it away to break the rule.
2. Now, walls are not stops, so I can move through them.
3. Navigate to the key at 6 right 1 down.
4. Pick up the key (if possible by changing rules) and use it on the door.
5. Open the door and reach the ball.

But how to pick up the key? The key is an object. If I can make a rule like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is key"", then maybe I can move the key. Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", I can move the key by moving towards it, but only if it's not stopped. Once walls are not stops, the key might be movable.

Wait, the key's rule is at 6 right 1 down: ""rule key 6 steps to the right and 1 step down"". So the key is an object with the 'key' property. To move the key, perhaps I need to make a rule like ""baba is push"" or ""key is push"", allowing me to push it. But the current rules don't have that.

Alternatively, if I can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is key"", then touching the key would make me key, but I'm not sure if that helps in moving it.

This is getting complicated. Let's think differently. The immediate goal is to reach the ball, which is win. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. The path might be blocked by walls, but if I can remove the 'stop' property from walls, I can get past.

So the priority is to break the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block that's part of that rule. The 'is' is at 4 left 2 up. To reach there, the player (Baba) needs to move left and up. But the way might be blocked.

Current position of Baba: According to the objects, there's a ""rule baba"" at 4 left and 3 down. So Baba is at that position. The player starts there, I assume. To move to the 'is' block at 4 left 2 up, the player needs to move right once (from 4 left to 3 left) and up once (from 3 down to 2 down). But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 up, which is a stop. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check the walls again.

Looking at the walls:

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down

So the right side has walls from up to down. The left side has walls at 4 left 2 up, 2 left 2 up, etc.

So from Baba's position at 4 left 3 down, moving right would take him towards the walls on the right side. To get to the 'is' block at 4 left 2 up, the player needs to move left (since they are at 4 left, moving left would decrease the left coordinate?), Wait, the directions might be relative. Maybe the coordinate system is such that left and right are relative to the player's perspective. This is a bit confusing without seeing the actual map layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at a central position, and objects are positioned relative to that. For example, ""3 step to the left"" means 3 steps to the left of the player. So to reach the 'is' block at 4 left 2 up, the player needs to move left 4 times and up 2 times. But there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe the player is near the lower part of the map, and the 'is' block to break is above and to the left. But I'm not sure. This requires more precise mapping.

Assuming that moving down is possible, perhaps the previous action was 'down', which moved the player down. Now in the new observation, the key is at 3 left 4 up, door at 2 left 4 up, etc. The player's position might have changed after moving down.

But without the exact map layout, it's challenging. Let's focus on the rules. The key rule is at 6 right 1 down. The 'is' block needed to create ""baba is win"" is at 5 right 4 up, but that's far from the baba rule.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule ""you is win"" by moving the 'is' next to 'you' and 'win'. The 'you' rule is at 2 left 3 down, and 'win' is at 6 right 4 up. That's a long distance. Not feasible.

Another approach: Use the 'key' to open the door. If I can get the key, then move it to the door and use it. But how to pick up the key? If ""baba is you"", maybe touching the key would make Baba key, but then how to use it? Perhaps create a rule ""key is open"" or ""key is door"", but that requires moving the 'key' rule next to 'door' and 'is'.

This is quite complex. Let's try to prioritize. The immediate obstacle is the wall at 1 step right and 3 up, which is a stop. If I can remove the 'stop' property from walls, I can move through them. To do that, break the 'wall is stop' rule by moving its 'is' block.

The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of the 'wall' rule at 4 left 2 up, 'is' at 4 left 2 up, and 'stop' at 2 left 2 up. Wait, no. The 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". The 'wall' rule is at 4 left 2 up, the 'is' is at 5 steps right and 3 step up? Wait, no, looking back:

The objects list includes:

rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up

rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up

rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up

Wait, the 'wall is stop' rule is made by the 'wall' rule at 4 left 2 up, the 'is' rule somewhere, and the 'stop' rule at 2 left 2 up. But where is the 'is' between them? It might be that the 'is' is not adjacent, so the rule is not active. Wait, no. The active rules are listed as ""wall is stop"" and ""ball is win"", ""baba is you"". So the 'wall is stop' rule must be formed by three adjacent text blocks: wall, is, stop. But according to the objects list, the 'wall' rule is at 4 left 2 up, 'is' is at 5 right 3 up, and 'stop' is at 2 left 2 up. These are not adjacent, so the rule ""wall is stop"" is not active? But the active rules do include ""wall is stop"". Hmm, maybe the positions are different.

Wait, the active rules are determined by text blocks that are adjacent in the game grid. So even if their positions in the objects list are not directly next to each other, if they are positioned next to each other on the grid, they form a rule. The objects list probably lists their positions on the grid.

Assuming that the 'wall' rule at 4 left 2 up, 'is' somewhere next to it, and 'stop' next to that, forming ""wall is stop"". To break this rule, I need to move one of these blocks away.

The 'is' block in the ""wall is stop"" rule is probably at a position between 'wall' and 'stop'. For example, 'wall' is at (x1, y1), 'is' at (x2, y2), and 'stop' at (x3, y3), where they are adjacent. If I can move the 'is' block, then the rule is broken.

Looking at the objects list, there's a 'rule `is`' at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. That's probably part of another rule, like ""door is door"" or something else. The 'is' needed to break ""wall is stop"" must be in that rule. Wait, no. The active rule ""wall is stop"" must have its 'is' block adjacent to both 'wall' and 'stop'. So perhaps the 'is' is located between 'wall' and 'stop' on the grid.

For example, 'wall' is at (4L, 2U), 'is' at (3L, 2U), and 'stop' at (2L, 2U). This would form ""wall is stop"". In this case, moving the 'is' block from (3L, 2U) to another position would break the rule.

But according to the objects list, the 'is' rule at 5 right 3 up is probably part of another rule, like ""door is door"" which is at 5 right 1 up. So the 'is' at 5 right 3 up is not part of the ""wall is stop"" rule.

This is getting too confusing without the actual grid layout. Let's think of the simplest solution. Since the key is needed to open the door, and the door is on the way to the ball, perhaps the solution is to get the key, open the door, and then reach the ball.

To get the key, which is at 6 right 1 down, the player needs to move right and down. But the path is blocked by walls on the right. If we can remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then the walls are no longer stops, and the player can move through them.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the 'is' block that is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule and move it away.
2. Now walls are not stops, so move right past the walls to reach the key.
3. Pick up the key (if possible by changing a rule).
4. Use the key on the door to open it.
5. Move through the door to reach the ball.

But how to pick up the key? If we make a rule like ""baba is key"", then touching the key would make us key. Then, maybe we can move the key by pushing it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if we make ""baba is push"", then we can push objects.

Alternatively, once walls","

Let's see. The goal is to get the ball because ""ball is win"". I'm Baba, so ""baba is you"". But how do I reach the ball?

First, looking at the map. The key is 3 steps left and 4 up. The door is 2 left and 4 up. There are walls here and there. The ""is"" rules are scattered. Maybe I need to move some rules to change things.

Wait, the ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. But there's a wall 1 step to the right of that. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to move the wall or change its property.

Looking at the active rules: ""wall is wall"" and ""stop is stop"". If I can make the wall not a stop, or turn myself into a wall to pass through. Let's see, there's a ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up"". Maybe I can move that rule somewhere else.

But to move a rule, I have to be next to it and it's not a stop. The ""is"" rule is 5 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I can pick up that ""is"" and combine it with other rules.

Alternatively, maybe make Baba into a door. If I can create ""baba is door"", then I can go through the door. But how? The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps right and 2 step up. If I move that ""door"" rule to link with ""baba"" and ""is"".

Wait, there's a ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down"". If I can move that ""baba"" rule up and combine it with an ""is"" and ""door"" to make ""baba is door"". Then, since I'm Baba (you), I can go through the door.

But how to get those rules together. Let me see the positions. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left, 3 down. The ""rule `is`"" is at 3 left, 2 down. The ""door"" rule is at 5 right, 2 up. Maybe move the ""is"" rule down to where the ""baba"" rule is, then place the ""door"" rule next to it.

Alternatively, pick up the ""is"" rule that's at 5 steps right and 4 up. Move it down to the area where the ""baba"" rule is. Then, place the ""door"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to form ""baba is door"".

But movement is step by step. Let me think about possible steps. First, maybe move down from my current position to reach the ""is"" rule. Or check where I am. Wait, the observation doesn't specify my position. Hmm, maybe the initial position is standard, but without knowing exact coordinates, this is tricky.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""key"" to the ball. But the key is at 6 right, 1 down. Not sure. Another approach: since the ball is win, maybe just reach it, but there's a wall blocking. So I need to remove the wall's stop property or become something that can pass through.

If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 left, 2 up. If I move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop. But to move it, I have to be next to it. Let's see: the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can get there, pick it up, and place it somewhere else. But how to get there without hitting walls.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, make ""baba is push"" so I can push walls. But there's no ""push"" rule. Or ""baba is move"", but that's not a standard property. Maybe ""baba is key"" to pick up keys, but that's not helpful here.

Wait, the key is present but I don't know if I need it. The door is there, but if I become a door, maybe I can go through it. Let me try that path again.

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left, 3 down. The ""rule `is`"" is at 3 left, 2 down. The ""rule `door`"" is at 5 right, 2 up. Maybe if I move the ""is"" rule down to the ""baba"" location, then place the ""door"" rule next to them to form ""baba is door"". To do that, I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule at 5 right, 4 up, then move down.

But directionally, how? Maybe first move down from where I am. The initial position isn't clear, but assuming I'm starting at Baba's location, which has the ""rule `baba`"" at 4 left, 3 down. So maybe I need to move right to reach the ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, the key is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can get the key, maybe that unlocks something. But the key is behind a wall. So maybe move the wall's stop property.

This is getting complicated. Let's try a step-by-step plan.

1. Find the ""is"" rule that can be used to create new rules. The one at 5 right, 4 up is a good candidate.

2. Move to that ""is"" rule. To do that, need to navigate from Baba's position. Since Baba's rule is at 4 left, 3 down, moving right towards the ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up.

Wait, directions are relative. Let's assume Baba is at a certain starting point. Maybe the ""rule `baba`"" is on the map, so I need to be adjacent to it to pick it up. Wait, no, to move a text block, you have to be next to it and it's not stop. So first, I need to reach the ""is"" rules.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 5 right and 4 up is a free rule. If I can move there, pick it up, and then combine with ""baba"" and ""door"".

But how to move there. Let's think in terms of steps. Suppose I need to move down from my current position (since previous actions were down and led to a change in key and door positions). Wait, in the previous steps, moving down caused the key and door to shift down a step. Maybe the map is scrolling or the player is moving, which affects the positions of objects.

This is confusing without exact coordinates. Maybe a better approach is to look for the nearest movable ""is"" rule. The one at 5 right, 4 up. If I can get there, pick it up, and then move to the ""baba"" rule at 4 left, 3 down. Wait, that's to the left, which might be a wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, the ""is"" rule at 1 step to the left. Maybe that's closer. If I can move left to pick that ""is"" rule, then combine it with ""baba"" and ""door"".

Wait, the ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"" is probably adjacent to something. Let me visualize the map.

Looking at the objects:

- The key is moving down each time an action is taken. In previous steps, after moving down, the key was at 3 left, 4 up, then 4 step up, etc. Maybe the level is dynamic, and moving down causes objects to shift.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the simplest solution is to move towards the ball, but there's a wall. So I need to remove the wall's stop property. To do that, find the ""wall is stop"" rule (at 4 left, 2 up) and move it somewhere else. But how to get there.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba immune to stop. For example, ""baba is not stop"". But there's no ""not"" rule. Alternatively, make ""stop is you"", so stops are you and can be walked over. But that requires redefining ""stop"".

Alternatively, make ""baba is push"", allowing me to push walls. Then push the wall out of the way.

But to create ""baba is push"", I need an ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""push"". There's no ""push"" rule on the map. The available rules are is, win, wall, stop, door, key, baba, you.

Wait, there's a ""rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 1 step down"". Maybe if I make ""baba is key"", then I can pick up the key, but that doesn't help with the wall.

Hmm. Alternatively, make ""wall is win"". Then the wall becomes the win condition, but I can't reach it because it's blocked.

Another angle: The ball is win, so if I can reach the ball, I win. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up, but there's a wall at 1 right. Maybe if I can make the wall not a stop. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule away, then the wall at 1 right wouldn't be stop.

So steps:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 4 left, 2 up.

2. Pick it up (since it's not a stop? Wait, ""wall is stop"" means walls are stop. But the rule itself is a text block. Are text blocks stop? By default, text blocks are not stop unless specified. The active rules include ""wall is stop"", so the text block ""wall"" has the stop property. But the ""is"" rules themselves—are they stop? Probably not, unless there's a rule saying ""is is stop"".

Looking at active rules: ""wall is stop"" and ""stop is stop"". So the ""stop"" rule is a stop. The ""wall"" rule is a stop because of ""wall is stop"". The ""is"" rules are not stop unless specified.

So to move the ""wall is stop"" rule (which is a text block), I need to be adjacent to it and it's not a stop. But ""wall is stop"" means that any object named ""wall"" is stop. However, the text block ""wall is stop"" itself—is it a stop? It depends on the rules. Since there's no rule saying ""text is stop"", and the rules in effect are ""wall is stop"" and ""stop is stop"", the ""wall is stop"" text block is a wall (subject) with property stop. So it's a stop. Therefore, I cannot move it because it's defined as stop.

Oh, that's a problem. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is itself a stop, making it immovable. So I can't pick it up. Damn.

Alternative plan: Find another way to remove the stop property from the wall. Maybe redefine ""stop"" to something else.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 2 up. It's a text block ""stop is stop"". If I can move that rule, then stops would no longer be stop. But again, the ""stop is stop"" rule makes the ""stop"" text block a stop. So it's immovable.

This is tricky. Maybe create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, ""wall is not stop"". But how to make that rule. I need an ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""not stop"". But there's no ""not"" rule. The available rules are is, win, wall, stop, door, key, baba, you.

Alternatively, use ""baba is you"" to become the ""not stop"" by making a rule like ""baba is not stop"". But again, no ""not"" rule.

Wait, maybe use ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, then reach the ball. But I'm already Baba, and ""ball is win"", so if I can touch the ball, I win. But the ball is behind a wall.

Alternatively, push the wall using a rule like ""baba is push"". To create that, I need an ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""push"". But there's no ""push"" rule. The closest is ""door"", ""key"", etc. Maybe ""baba is door"", then go through the door. But the door is at 2 left, 4 up. If I become a door, can I go through it?

If ""baba is door"", then since I'm you (baba is you), and door is a win? No, the active rules are ""ball is win"". So becoming a door wouldn't help unless there's a door as win, which there isn't.

Alternatively, make ""baba is key"", then pick up the key and use it on the door. But the door's rule is at 5 right, 2 up. If I have the key, maybe combine it with the door's rule. But I don't know how keys work in Baba Is You. Usually, you push the key to the door, but I might need a rule like ""key is push"" or ""key is move"".

This is getting too vague. Let's try a different approach. Let's look for all movable ""is"" rules.

The ""is"" rules are at:

- 5 steps right and 3 step up

- 1 step to the left

- 5 steps right and 1 step up

- 5 steps right

- 3 step to the left and 3 step down

- 2 step to the left and 3 step down

The closest ""is"" rule might be the one at 1 step to the left. If I can move there, maybe combine it with ""baba"" and ""door"" to create ""baba is door"".

Assuming I'm next to that ""is"" rule, I can move left to pick it up, then move to the ""baba"" rule at 4 left, 3 down, place the ""is"" there, then add the ""door"" rule to make ""baba is door"".

But how to navigate there. Let's assume I need to move left to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step left. Then move down to the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, the ""is"" rule at 5 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move right and down to reach it.

This is really challenging without knowing the exact positions. Maybe the best action is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 5 right, 4 up, hoping to pick it up and then create a new rule.

Alternatively, since the previous action was down and it caused the key and door to move down, maybe continuing to move down will eventually shift the obstacles out of the way.

But in the last observation, after moving down, the key is now at 3 left, 4 up (wait, no, in the latest observation, the key is 3 step left and 4 step up after previous down actions). It seems the level is scrolling or the player is moving, causing objects to shift.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move right to reach the ball, overcoming the walls by redefining rules.

Wait, the ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right four times, but there's a wall at 1 step right. If I can make myself not a stop, or make the wall not a stop.

But how. The only way is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since that rule is itself a stop, I can't move it. So perhaps create a new rule that says ""stop is not stop"". But again, there's no ""not"" rule.

Alternatively, use ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition, then reach the ball. But the ball is win already, so maybe just touch it. But I'm blocked by a wall.

Alternatively, push the wall. If I can make walls pushable. To do that, create ""wall is push"". But no ""push"" rule exists. The available subjects are is, win, wall, stop, door, key, baba, you.

Maybe ""baba is push"", then push the wall. But to create ""baba is push"", I need an ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""push"". There's no ""push"" rule, so that's not possible.

Another idea: Use the ""key"" to unlock the door. If the door requires a key, but there's no rule stating that. In Baba Is You, usually, you need to push the key to the door, but that requires the key to be movable and the door to accept it. However, without a rule like ""key is push"" or ""door is open"", it's not straightforward.

This is really tricky. Let's try to think of the most straightforward path. The ball is win, so if I can touch it. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. The path is blocked by a wall at 1 right. If I can move that wall.

To move the wall, I need to be able to push it. For that, there needs to be a rule that allows pushing. Since there's no ""push"" rule, maybe create ""baba is push"". To do that, find an ""is"" rule and combine it with ""baba"" and ""push"".

Assuming I can reach the ""is"" rule at 5 right, 3 up, pick it up, then move to the wall and place ""baba is push"" there. Then, push the wall away.

But how to navigate there. The wall is at 1 right, 4 up. The ""is"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. So from the wall's position, move left to reach the ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, this is taking too long. Maybe the intended solution is to move down further, causing the key and door to move, making a path. But in the last observation, after moving down, the key was at 3 left, 4 up, and the door at 2 left, 4 up. Still blocked by walls.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""baba"" able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is stop"". No, that would make me a stop. Or ""baba is win"", but I'm already that.

Wait, I'm already ""baba is you"", and ""ball is win"". So if I can reach the ball, I win. The main obstacle is the wall at 1 right. If I can redefine that wall's property.

The wall's rule is at 4 left, 2 up: ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up"". If I can move that rule away, then the wall at 1 right wouldn't be a stop.

But to move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it and it's not a stop. The ""wall is","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, typically, the goal is to reach the ball because it's set as the win condition. But since Baba is You, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the left and up from my position, a door left and up, some walls, and various rule text blocks. The rule ""is"" is positioned at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. The ""win"" rule is even further right. The ""ball"" rule is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. 

The first thing I need to do is get to the ball to win. But there are walls blocking the path. The door is left and up, which might be locked unless I have the key. The key is 3 steps left and 4 steps up. So maybe I need to go get the key first. But how do I move past the walls?

Wait, the rules mention ""wall is wall"" and ""stop"" is a rule. So walls are stop, meaning I can't move through them. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can change the rules to bypass the walls. For example, if I can make a wall into something else by rearranging the ""wall is wall"" rule. 

The ""is"" rule is movable, right? So if I can move the ""is"" text block, I can create new rules. Let's see. The ""wall"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" from 5 steps right and 4 steps up to next to ""wall"", then I could say ""wall is [something else]"". But how do I get to that position?

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself not stop. If there's a ""stop"" rule, perhaps I can move that text block away or change it. But the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a wall. 

Wait, the current position of Baba (from the observation) isn't explicitly mentioned, but looking at the objects, the rule ""baba"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So maybe that's where I am. To move up towards the key and door, I need to navigate through the walls. Let's map this out.

Starting position is rule `baba` at 4 left, 3 down. To get to the key at 3 left, 4 up, I need to move up and left. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. Hmm. Maybe I can push that wall by changing its rule. If I can turn the wall into something movable, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", then I could move it out of the way.

Looking at the available rules, there's a ""stop"" rule. If I can replace ""wall is wall"" with ""wall is stop"", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can make ""stop"" into something else. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up. If I move the ""is"" next to ""stop"", I could change it. For example, moving ""is"" to make ""stop is push"" or ""stop is you"". But I need to get there first.

Alternatively, since the key is needed to open the door, maybe getting the key is the priority. The key is at 3 left, 4 up. From my position (4 left, 3 down), I need to move left once and up three steps. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see the objects:

- Wall at 1 right, 4 up.
- Wall at 1 right, 3 up.
- Wall at 1 right, 2 up.
- Then there's a rule `door` at 5 right, 2 up.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: Since ""baba is you"", I can move any text block that's not stop. The ""is"" rule at 5 right, 4 up is movable. If I can move that ""is"" to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, making ""wall is push"" so I can move them out of the way. But to do that, I need to be next to the ""wall"" rule at 4 left, 3 up. 

Let me try to plan a path. From my position (4 left, 3 down), moving left once gets me to 3 left, 3 down. Then up to 3 left, 4 up. But there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up. Wait, maybe coordinates are relative. Let me clarify the positions.

Assuming Baba is at (4 left, 3 down), the key is at (3 left, 4 up). The wall blocking the path is at (1 right, 4 up). Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the coordinates are absolute. Let me parse the positions again.

The objects are listed with their positions relative to Baba, I think. For example, ""key 3 step to the left and 3 step up"" means the key is 3 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba's current position.

So if I need to get to the key, which is 3 left and 3 up, but there's a wall at 1 right and 4 up. That wall is actually to the right and above the key. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. Let me visualize.

If Baba is at (0,0), then:

- Key is at (-3, 3) (3 steps left, 3 up)
- Door is at (-2, 3)
- Wall at (1, 3)
- Rule `is` at (5,3)
- Rule `win` at (6,3)
- Rule `wall` at (-4, 2)
- Rule `stop` at (-2, 2)
- Etc.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to prioritize moving the ""is"" text block to create a new rule. For example, to make ""wall is push"", which allows moving walls. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at (-4, 2). The ""is"" is at (5,3). That's quite far. Alternatively, the ""is"" at (5,3) could be moved to adjacent a text block. For instance, moving ""is"" to be next to ""win"" at (6,3) to make ""win is [something]"". But what's the point?

Alternatively, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"", then I can make ""baba is [something]"". For example, ""baba is push"" to push objects, or ""baba is win"" to change the win condition. 

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can make ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba would win the level. But how?

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""you"" rule at 2 left and 3 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" into ""baba is win"", but that would require moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". The ""win"" rule is at 6 right and 4 up. That's a long way.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 1 left. If I move that ""is"" to next to ""baba"", then I can create a new rule. For example, ""baba is win"". Then, since I'm Baba (you), touching me would make you win. So I just need to stand still? But that doesn't make sense. Maybe the goal is to push the ball to me? Or maybe change the ""win"" condition to something else.

Alternatively, the key is needed to open the door. The door is at (-2,3), which is left and up from the key. So if I get the key, I can open the door. The key is at (-3,3). To get there, I need to move left and up, but there's a wall at (1,3). Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the walls are arranged in a certain pattern that I can navigate around by changing rules.

Another approach: Since ""ball is win"", if I can push the ball to a place where I can reach it. But the ball is at (4 right, 1 up). From my position (0,0), that's right and up. But there are walls blocking the path. Maybe if I can make the walls stop being stop.

If I can change ""wall is wall"" to ""wall is push"", then I can move the walls. The ""wall"" rule is at (-4,2). So if I can move the ""is"" next to it, say to (-4,2), then create ""wall is push"". Then I can push the walls out of the way.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" from (5,3) to (-4,2). That would require moving left and down multiple steps. But how?

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 1 left. If I move that ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule at (-4,2), then I can create the new rule. But moving from (1 left, current y) to (-4,2) would take several steps. This seems complicated.

Maybe a better approach is to go get the key first. The key is at (-3,3). To reach there, move left three times and up three times. But the path is blocked by walls at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). Wait, maybe those are walls to the right of Baba's position. So if I'm at (0,0), moving left would go to (-1,0), etc. But the walls are at (1,3), which is to the right and up. So that's actually in the opposite direction from the key.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to focus on moving the ""is"" text block to create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. Let's see. The ""is"" at (5,3) is far to the right. If I can move that ""is"" to next to the ""stop"" rule at (-2,2), then I could change ""stop"" to something else. For example, ""stop is nothing"", making stops not stop. But how to reach that ""is""?

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 1 left. If I move that ""is"" to next to ""baba"", then I can create ""baba is [something]"". For example, ""baba is push"" to push objects, or ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition. Let's try that.

From my position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule at 4 left, 3 down), to get to the ""is"" at 1 left, I need to move right once to 3 left, 3 down. Then up to 3 left, 4 up. But there's a wall at 1 right,4 up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative differently. This is getting too confusing without a visual. 

Alternatively, think step by step. The immediate goal is to reach the ball to win. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. To get there, move right and up. But there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up. Wait, maybe the wall is not on the direct path. Let me check the objects again.

The walls are at:

- 1 step right and 3 step up
- 1 step right and 2 step up
- 1 step right and 1 step up
- Then down at 1 right and 1 down, etc.

So from the ball's position (4 right, 1 up), the path to Baba's starting position (4 left, 3 down) is blocked by walls on the right side. This seems like a maze. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules to make the walls passable.

For example, if I can change the ""wall is wall"" rule to ""wall is you"", then walls would become pushable. But the ""wall is wall"" rule is at 4 left, 2 up. To change that, I need to move the ""is"" next to it. The ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up is too far. The ""is"" at 1 left is closer.

If I can move the ""is"" at 1 left to next to the ""wall"" rule at 4 left, 2 up. So from 1 left, I need to move left 3 steps and down 1 step to get to 4 left, 2 up. That would require going left, left, left, down. But how?

Baba's position is at 4 left, 3 down. So moving left from there would be to 3 left, 3 down. Then again to 2 left, 3 down, then 1 left, 3 down, then 0 left, 3 down. Then down to 0 left, 2 down. But there might be walls blocking this path. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 1 left. If I move that ""is"" to the left, but it's already at 1 left. Maybe move it up or down. If I move it up to 1 left, 1 up, then place it next to the ""wall"" rule at 4 left, 2 up. That would require moving the ""is"" from 1 left to 4 left, 2 up, which is a diagonal move. Not sure if possible.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to push a rule block to create a new rule. For example, move the ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up to next to the ""win"" rule at 6 right, 4 up, making ""win is [something]"". But what's the point?

Alternatively, make the door not a stop. The door is at 5 right, 2 up. The ""door"" rule is there. If I can change ""door is stop"" to something else. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. Not sure.

Another angle: Since the key is needed to open the door, maybe I should first get the key. The key is at 3 left, 4 up. To reach there, move left three times and up four times. But there are walls at 1 right, 4 up. Wait, if I'm at 4 left, 3 down, moving left three steps would get me to 1 left, 3 down. Then up four steps to 1 left, 7 down? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinates are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out in a grid where each step changes the x or y coordinate. For example, moving left decreases the x-coordinate, right increases it. Up increases the y-coordinate, down decreases it.

Assuming that, the key is at x=-3, y=3 (3 steps left and 3 up from Baba's starting position at x=0, y=0). The door is at x=-2, y=3. Walls are at (x=1, y=3), (x=1, y=2), (x=1, y=1), etc.

To get to the key at (x=-3, y=3), I need to move left three times and up three times. The path is blocked by walls at (x=1, y=3), which is in the opposite direction. So maybe there's another way around.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" text blocks to create a rule that allows moving through walls. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"". Then, since walls are you, I can move through them. But how to do that?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at x=-4, y=2. The ""is"" needed to change this is at x=5, y=3. That's a distance away. Maybe use another ""is"" block. The ""is"" at x=1, y=0 (assuming the ""is"" at 1 step left is at x=-1, y=0). If I can move that ""is"" to next to the ""wall"" rule at x=-4, y=2.

From x=-1, y=0 to x=-4, y=2: move left three times and up two times. That's possible if the path is clear. But there are walls at x=1, y=3 and others, but maybe not in that direction.

Once the ""is"" is moved to x=-4, y=2, I can create the new rule ""wall is you"". Then, since walls are you, I can move through them. Then I can go around the walls to get the key.

Alternatively, make ""stop"" not a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at x=-2, y=2. If I can change that, maybe to ""stop is nothing"". But again, need to get the ""is"" next to it.

This is quite complex. Maybe the fastest way is to move the ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up to next to the ""win"" rule at 6 right, 4 up, making ""win is key"". Then, getting the key would make me win. But how to do that?

To move the ""is"" from (5,4) to (6,4), I need to move it right once. But is that possible? If there's no wall blocking, then yes. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that moving right from (5,4) to (6,4) is possible if there's no wall there.

Assuming that's the case, moving right to get the ""is"" next to ""win"" would create ""win is key"", making the key the win condition. Then, going to the key would win the level. But the key is at 3 left, 4 up, which is in the opposite direction. So this might not help.

Another idea: Make the door not a stop. The door is at 5 right, 2 up. If I can change ""door is stop"" to something else. The ""door"" rule is there, and the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. Maybe move the ""is"" next to the ""door"" rule to create ""door is key"" or something. But not sure.

Wait, the active rules include ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching myself would","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which in this case is the ball. Currently, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". Since Baba is You, that means whatever actions I can perform are based on being Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key, a door, several walls, and various rule text blocks. The key is 3 steps left and 4 up from where I'm probably starting. The door is 2 steps left and 4 up. There's a wall directly to the right and up at 4 step right and 4 step up. Also, there are rule blocks for 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'key', 'baba', and 'you' scattered around.

First, I need to get to the ball (win) behind the door. But the door is there, and normally doors are STOP unless their rule is changed. The current rules don't mention the door as anything other than a rule block. So to pass through the door, maybe I can change its rule. For example, if I make the door not a STOP, then I can move through it.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"". That means ""door is [something]"". The current active rule for door isn't listed, but the existence of that rule block might mean that if I can change it, I can alter the door's properties. Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the door's default property might still be STOP unless changed. The ""rule `door`"" block is probably a placeholder that can be modified by moving text blocks to form a new rule like ""door is not stop"" or something.

But how do I get to that rule block? The key is 3 steps left and 4 up. If I can reach the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But to get the key, I need to navigate around the walls. There are walls to the right at various positions. Let me visualize the map.

Starting position: Let's assume I'm at the position where the 'baba' rule is located, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. From there, moving up would bring me towards the door and key. There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 step up. So if I go up from my starting position, I hit a wall. Maybe I need to move left or right first.

Alternatively, looking at the objects, the 'is' rule blocks are scattered. To create a new rule, I need to move 'is' with another text block. For example, if I can move 'is' to combine with 'door' and 'not stop', but I don't see a 'not' block here. Wait, maybe the key is important. If I get the key, perhaps it allows me to move through walls or something, but the current rules don't mention key as a property. The key is just an object; unless I make a rule like ""key is push"" or ""key is you"", but I'm Baba, so maybe I can pick up the key and use it to manipulate other rules.

Let me think step by step. The immediate goal is to reach the ball. To do that, I need to pass through the door. The door is a STOP unless its rule is changed. The existing rule blocks include ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So if I can move that 'door' rule block and combine it with 'is' and something else to change its property. For example, if I make ""door is not stop"", then the door wouldn't block me.

But how to get to that 'door' rule block. It's located at 5 steps right and 1 step up. From my starting position (4 left, 3 down), moving right would get me towards the walls. Wait, the walls are at 1 step right and 4 up, 2 step right and 3 up, etc. So navigating right might hit walls. Maybe moving left instead. The key is 3 steps left and 4 up. If I go left three steps and up four, I can get the key. But the path might be blocked. Let me check the objects again.

The key is at 3 left, 4 up. From my starting position (assuming the 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down), moving left 3 steps would get me to the key's x-coordinate. Then moving up 4 steps. But along the way, are there walls? Let's see:

Starting at 4 left, 3 down. Moving left 3 steps: positions would be 3 left, 3 down; 2 left, 3 down; 1 left, 3 down; then 0 left, 3 down. Then moving up 4 steps: 0 left, 7 down? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is different. The observations mention steps in directions. Maybe each 'step' is a grid movement. So to get from the starting position to the key at 3 left and 4 up, I need to move left 3 times and up 4 times. But need to check if there are walls in between.

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down

So all the walls are on the right side, except maybe some others. The key is on the left side (3 left, 4 up). So moving left from the starting position (assuming starting at 0,0) would avoid the walls on the right. So left 3 steps to reach the key's x-coordinate, then up 4 steps. But wait, the key is at 3 left and 4 up. So from the starting position (assuming it's at 0,0), moving left 3 and up 4 would get there. However, I need to check if there are any walls in that path.

Looking at the walls, the closest wall to the left is at 4 step to the left and 2 step up (rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up). Wait, that's a rule block, not a wall object. The wall objects are at various positions to the right. So moving left should be clear of walls. Therefore, I can path left 3 and up 4 to get the key.

Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But how? Unless there's a rule that when you have the key, you can pass through doors. But currently, the rules don't mention keys. Alternatively, maybe the key is used to move other objects, like the rule blocks. For example, if I can move the 'door' rule block to change its property.

After getting the key, I need to go to the door's rule block at 5 steps right and 1 step up. But from the key's position (3 left, 4 up), moving right 5 steps would take me to 2 right (since 3 left +5 right = 2 right), and up 1 step. Along the way, are there walls? The walls on the right are at 1 step right and various ups. So moving right from 3 left (which is -3) to 5 steps right would pass through x=2,1,0,1,2,3? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider that movement is in grid steps, and the walls are positioned in specific grid cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is not the immediate solution. Let's think about the rule blocks. The 'is' rule blocks are scattered. For example, there's a rule `is` at 5 steps right and 3 step up, another at 1 step left, etc. To create a new rule, I need to combine a subject with a property using an 'is' block. For instance, if I can move 'is' next to 'door' and 'not stop', but I don't have a 'not' block. However, there's a 'stop' rule at 2 left and 2 up. Maybe I can reassign the door's property.

The existing active rules are ball is win and baba is you. So door's default might be stop. The rule `door` at 5 right, 1 up means that the current rule for door is perhaps undefined, or it's part of a potential rule. Wait, no—the active rules are the ones that are currently enforced. The other rule blocks are just available to be moved into place to form new rules.

So the 'rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up' is a text block that can be moved. If I can move it next to an 'is' block and another property, like 'not stop', then I can create a new rule. But I don't have a 'not' block. However, maybe there's another way. If I can make the door into a 'you' or 'win', but that might not help. Alternatively, make the door 'push' so I can move it out of the way.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can push objects. If I can push the door or the rule blocks. But the door is a stop, so I can't push it unless its rule is changed. So the plan is: change the door's rule from stop to something else, like 'push' or remove the 'stop' property.

To do that, I need to find where the 'stop' rule is defined. There's a 'rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up'. That means the current rule for 'stop' is defined there. But how does that affect the door? The door's rule is at 5 right, 1 up. If I can combine that with 'is' and another property, maybe I can override the stop.

Wait, the active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. The other rule blocks are potential rules that can be activated by moving them. For example, if I move 'is' to be next to 'door' and 'push', then 'door is push' becomes an active rule, allowing me to push the door.

But where is the 'push' block? I don't see a rule `push` in the objects. Unless 'push' is derived from another rule. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can make the door into a 'you', so I can move it by moving Baba. But the door is a separate object; unless I can make it 'you', then I could move it.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can move other 'you' objects. But the only 'you' rule is at 2 left and 3 down, which is part of the 'baba is you' rule. So if I can make the door 'you', then I could move it. But how?

Let me think. The current active rules are 'baba is you' and 'ball is win'. The door's rule isn't active yet because there's no active rule defining door's property except possibly inherited from 'stop'. Since there's a 'rule `stop` 2 left 2 up', which might mean 'stop is [something]', but that's not clear. Wait, the rule blocks are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the 'rule `stop` 2 left 2 up' is a text block that can be part of a rule. For example, if I move it next to an 'is' block and a property, it could form a new rule.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since the ball is the win, and it's behind the door, I need to remove the door's stop property. To do that, I can create a rule that says 'door is not stop', but I don't have a 'not' block. Alternatively, overwrite the existing 'stop' rule for door.

Alternatively, use the key to manipulate the rules. If I can get the key and then use it to move the 'is' blocks to form a new rule. For example, moving the 'key' to a position where it can be part of a rule. But I'm not sure how the key would help here.

Wait, the key is at 3 left, 4 up. If I go get the key, then maybe I can use it to push other objects. But the current rules don't make the key pushable. Unless I create a rule like 'key is push', which would allow me to move it. But to create that rule, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'key' and 'push'.

Alternatively, once I have the key, I can move it to the 'door' rule block area and combine it with 'is' and another property. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, focus on changing the door's rule. The door's rule is at 5 right, 1 up. If I can move that 'door' text block next to an 'is' and a property like 'win' or 'you', but that might not help. For example, making 'door is you' would let me move the door as if it were Baba. But the door is a separate object; unless I make it 'you', I can move it by moving Baba onto it. Wait, if the door is 'you', then I can move it by pushing it, but I need the 'push' property.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the ball (win) behind the door.
- Current active rules: ball is win, baba is you. So I am Baba, can move around, but doors are stop.
- Door is at 2 left, 4 up. Behind it is the ball.
- To pass the door, need to make it not a stop. How?
- The 'door' rule block is at 5 right, 1 up. If I can change that rule, perhaps to 'door is push' or remove 'stop'.

But how to form that rule. There's an 'is' block at 5 right, 4 up. Maybe I can move the 'door' rule block to be next to that 'is' and then add a property. For example, move 'door' to 5 right, 4 up (next to 'is'), then add a 'push' block. But I don't have a 'push' block. Alternatively, use another existing rule. There's a 'win' rule at 6 right, 4 up. Maybe combining 'door' with 'win'?

Alternatively, use the 'key' to get to the 'is' blocks. Let's try this step by step:

1. Move left 3 times and up 4 times to get the key.
2. With the key, move right to the area of the 'is' blocks at 5 right, 4 up.
3. Combine 'door' rule block with 'is' and a new property, like 'push' or remove 'stop'.

But I don't see a 'push' text block. However, there's a 'stop' rule block at 2 left, 2 up. Maybe I can move that 'stop' rule to elsewhere, effectively removing it. For example, if the active rule for stop is at 2 left 2 up, and I move that text block away, then the stop property for door might be removed.

But doors are stop by default because of the 'rule `stop`' somewhere. Wait, the active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. The other rule blocks are potential. So the door's stop property must be coming from another rule. Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up'. That probably means 'stop is [something]', but what? If that rule is 'stop is wall', then walls are stop. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the existence of the 'rule `stop`' block allows for the stop property to be applied. If I can remove that 'stop' rule, then the door's stop property might be gone. But how? To remove a rule, you need to move its text blocks away. The 'rule `stop`' is at 2 left 2 up. If I can move that text block away, then the stop rule is deactivated.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule block at 2 left 2 up.
2. Move it away, say, to the right, so it's no longer forming an active rule.
3. Then, the door's stop property is removed, allowing me to pass through.

But how to move the 'stop' rule block. To move any object (including text blocks), they must not be defined as 'stop' or similar. Currently, the only immovable things are walls and possibly STOP objects. Since the 'stop' rule is at 2 left 2 up, but unless there's an active rule saying that 'stop' is STOP, it can be moved. Wait, the active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. There's no rule making 'stop' immovable. So I can move the 'stop' rule block.

So step by step:

- Go to the 'stop' rule block at 2 left 2 up.
- Move it to a different position, say, to the right, so it's no longer part of an active rule.

Once that's done, the door's stop property might be removed, allowing me to pass through.

After removing the 'stop' rule, the door would no longer be STOP, so I can walk through it.

Then, go to the door at 2 left 4 up and pass through to get the ball.

But how to navigate there, considering the walls.

Alternatively, after removing the 'stop' rule, I can walk through the door.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Move from starting position (assuming 4 left, 3 down) to the 'stop' rule block at 2 left 2 up.
   - To get there: from 4 left 3 down, move left 2 steps (to 2 left 3 down), then up 1 step (to 2 left 2 up). But need to check if path is clear.
   - Along the way, are there walls? From 4 left 3 down to 2 left 3 down: moving left, no walls mentioned in that area. Then up to 2 left 2 up: no walls listed there either.

2. Once at the 'stop' rule block, move it. Since it's a text block, and I'm Baba (you), I can move it. The action would","

7,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the ball since it's set as ""win"", but maybe I can change that. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, as Baba, I can manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the left and up from where I probably am. A door is also up there. There are walls blocking some paths. There are also several ""rule is"" blocks scattered around. The key might be needed to open the door, but since the ball is win, maybe I just need to get to the ball. But how?

Wait, the ball is 3 steps left and 4 steps up. But there's a wall 1 step right and 4 steps up. So, maybe I can't go directly up. Let me check the other walls. There's a wall 1 step right and 3 steps up, 2 steps up, etc. So the path up is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to use the rules to change something.

The ""rule is"" blocks are at different positions. For example, there's a rule `is` 5 steps right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. If I can make ""baba is win"" or ""door is key"", that might help. But first, I need to reach those rule blocks.

Wait, as Baba, I can move unless there's a stop rule. The active rules are ball is win and baba is you, so I can move. Let me see where I am. The key is 3 steps left and 4 steps up. Maybe I'm positioned somewhere in the middle. Let's assume I'm starting at the bottom right, near the wall 1 step to the right. The rule `key` is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe I need to move towards the rule `is` blocks.

The rule `is` at 5 steps right and 4 steps up could be useful. If I can get there and pair it with ""baba"" or ""key"" to create a new rule. For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""key"" to make ""baba is key"". Then I could use the key to open the door. But the door is 2 steps left and 4 steps up, which is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe making ""door is win"" so that reaching the door makes me win. But how to do that? I need to move the ""door"" text block next to ""is"" and ""win"". The ""win"" rule is 6 steps right and 4 steps up. The ""door"" rule is 5 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move the ""door"" rule upwards and combine it with ""is"" and ""win"".

But first, I need to navigate around the walls. Let's see. The path to the upper right has walls, but maybe moving down to the lower right. There's a wall 1 step right, and then further down. The rule `baba` is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, and there's a rule `is` there. Maybe I can create ""baba is win"" by moving those blocks.

Wait, the rule `baba` is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The rule `is` is 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The rule `you` is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move the `baba` text next to `is` and `win`, that would make ""baba is win"". Then, since I'm Baba and ""you"", I could just walk to the ball which is win.

But how to get to those rule blocks? The current position of the rule `baba` is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. If I'm positioned at the bottom right, maybe I need to move left and down. But there are walls at 1 step right and various positions. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the position with the wall 1 step to the right. To reach the rule `baba` at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, I need to move left four times and down three times. But there might be walls blocking the path. Let's check the walls:

- Wall at 1 step right and 4 up.
- Walls at 1 step right, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, right, and down steps.
- Another wall at 4 left and 2 down.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the existing rules. Since ""baba is you"", I can move any object that isn't stopped. The walls are defined as stop, so I can't move them. But the rules and other objects like the key and door can be moved.

So, the plan is:

1. Move the ""rule is"" blocks to create new rules.
2. Change the win condition to something reachable, like the door or a different object.
3. Use the key to open the door if needed.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" so touching the ball wins. To do that, find the ""baba"" text block, move it next to ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe it's easier to move the ""win"" rule to be near ""baba"" and ""is"".

But moving the ""win"" rule would require moving it left and down. Let's see where the ""win"" rule is: 6 steps right and 4 steps up. To get it near the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, which are on the left side, I need to move it left and down. But can I move it? Since there's no rule preventing it unless it's under a stop. The walls are on the right side, so maybe moving left is possible.

Alternatively, find a ""rule is"" block and use it to create a new rule. For example, moving ""rule is"" 5 steps right and 4 up to combine with ""baba"" and ""key"" or something else.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps again:

- Current active rules: ball is win, baba is you.
- Goal: Reach the ball (which is win), but path is blocked by walls.
- Need to manipulate rules to either remove the wall's stop property, make myself able to move through walls, change the win condition, or create a path.

Possible solutions:

1. Change ""wall is stop"" to something else. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 4 left and 2 up. If I can move this rule to make ""wall is [something else]"", like ""wall is push"" or remove it. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule or the ""wall"" rule.

2. Make ""baba is push"" so I can push walls aside. Then move the walls out of the way.

3. Make ""baba is key"" and get the key to open the door, then go through the door.

4. Change the win condition to door, so reaching the door wins.

Let's explore option 2: Make ""baba is push"". To do this, find the ""is"" rule and combine it with ""baba"" and ""push"". The ""push"" rule isn't present, but maybe I can use another existing rule. Wait, the existing rules are ball is win, baba is you, wall is stop, stop is at 2 left and 2 up, etc.

Alternatively, create ""baba is push"" by moving the ""baba"" text next to ""is"" and ""push"", but there's no ""push"" text. Unless I can use ""key"" or another object as push. Not sure.

Alternatively, make ""baba is key"" so that when I touch the key, it becomes me. Then maybe I can move the key. But the key is 3 left and 4 up. If I become the key, touching it does nothing. Not helpful.

Option 3: Change win to door. So create ""door is win"". To do that, move the ""door"" rule (at 5 right and 2 up) next to ""is"" (like the one at 1 left and 1 up) and ""win"" (6 right and 4 up). But that seems far. Alternatively, use a different ""is"" rule. There's an ""is"" at 5 steps right and 4 up. Maybe move the ""door"" rule to be next to that ""is"" and ""win"".

But how to move those rules? Let's see the positions:

- ""door"" rule: 5 right, 2 up.
- ""is"" rule at 5 right, 4 up.
- ""win"" rule at 6 right, 4 up.

If I can move the ""door"" rule up to 5 right, 4 up, then place it next to the ""is"" there and the ""win"" at 6 right, 4 up. But moving the door up two steps. Is that possible? The path might be blocked by walls. The wall at 1 step right and various positions. The door is at 5 right, 2 up. To move it up to 4 up, need to navigate around walls. There's a wall at 1 right and 2 up, but the door is further right. Maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move ""door"" to 5 right, 4 up, then place ""is"" there and ""win"" next to it. Then ""door is win"" would be created. Then touching the door would make me win.

But to move the door rule up, I need to move it step by step. Each move is one step in a direction. So from 5 right, 2 up, move up to 3 up, then 4 up. But are there walls in between? Let's check:

At 5 right, 3 up: Is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up, but that's on the left side. On the right side, walls are at 1 step right and various up/down positions. So moving the door up from 5 right, 2 up to 5 right, 3 up should be possible if there's no wall there. The observation doesn't list a wall at 5 right, 3 up, so maybe it's clear. Then move up again to 4 up. Then place it next to the ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up and ""win"" at 6 right, 4 up.

Once ""door is win"" is created, go to the door (2 left, 4 up) which is now win. But the door is behind walls. The path to the door is blocked by walls at 1 right and 4 up, and others. Unless we can make the walls stop being stop. If we change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you"", then I can move through walls. But that requires manipulating that rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left and 2 up. To change it, move it next to a different property. For example, move ""wall"" to next to ""is"" and ""you"". The ""you"" rule is at 2 left and 2 down. That's a bit far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, make ""baba is push"" to push walls aside. To do that, find the ""is"" rule and combine ""baba"", ""is"", and ""push"". But there's no ""push"" rule. Unless we can use ""key"" as push, but that's not a property.

This is really tricky. Let's think again. The key is 3 left and 4 up. The door is 2 left and 4 up. The ball is the win. The walls are blocking the path. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that allows moving through walls or removes their stop property.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" so that just being Baba makes me win, regardless of the ball. But the current rule is ""ball is win"", so I need to change that. To make ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" text next to ""is"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left and 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 left and 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right and 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe use another ""is"" rule. The ""is"" at 5 right and 4 up. If I can move ""baba"" to 5 right and 4 up, then place ""is"" there and ""win"" next to it. But moving ""baba"" from 4 left, 3 down to 5 right, 4 up would require moving right 9 steps and up 1 step. That's impossible in one move. I need to move step by step.

Alternatively, find a shorter path. From the initial position (assuming near the wall 1 step right), move left to reach the ""baba"" rule. Let's say the player is at position (0,0), and the wall is at (1,4). The ""baba"" rule is at (-4, -3). To get there, move left 4 times and down 3 times. But there are walls at 1 right and various up/down positions. For example, at (1,3), (1,2), etc. So moving left from (0,0) would avoid those walls. Once at (-4, -3), which is the ""baba"" rule, then move the ""is"" rule from (3 left, 3 down) to adjacent, and ""win"" from (6 right,4 up) which is even further.

This seems too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the existing ""rule is"" blocks to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, create ""baba is key"" so that touching the key makes me Baba (which I already am), not helpful. Or ""key is you"", making the key controllable. Then pick up the key and use it to open the door.

To make ""key is you"", need to move the ""key"" rule (4 steps right) next to ""is"" and ""you"". The ""you"" rule is at 2 left and 2 down. So from the key's position at 4 right, move left to 2 left, which is 6 steps left. Then down to 2 down, which is 4 steps down. That's a lot, but possible step by step.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at 5 right and 4 up. Move the ""key"" there and pair it with ""you"". The ""key"" is at 4 right,1 up. So move right to 5 right, then up to 4 up. Then place ""is"" next to it and ""you"" somewhere else. But ""you"" is at 2 left, 2 down. Not close.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""rule is"" blocks to create a new rule. Let's look for a cluster of rules. The ""is"" at 5 right,4 up, ""win"" at 6 right,4 up, and ""door"" at 5 right,2 up. If I can move the ""door"" up to 5 right,4 up and then create ""door is win"", that would work. So from 5 right,2 up, move up two steps to 4 up (assuming no walls in between). Then place ""door"" next to ""is"" and ""win"". That would create ""door is win"".

To move the door up, check if the path is clear. From 5 right,2 up to 5 right,3 up: Is there a wall? The observation doesn't mention a wall there, so probably clear. Then move up to 4 up. Now, the door is at 5 right,4 up, next to the ""is"" at 5 right,4 up. Then place the ""win"" at 6 right,4 up next to it. So the rule would be ""door is win"".

Once that's done, moving to the door (2 left,4 up) would make me win. But how to get to the door? It's blocked by walls. Unless I can change the wall's property. For example, make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is you"", allowing me to move through walls. To do that, need to move the ""wall"" rule (4 left,2 up) next to ""is"" and ""you"". The ""you"" rule is at 2 left,2 down. So from 4 left,2 up, move right to 2 left (2 steps right), then down to 2 down (0 steps down). Then place ""is"" there. So the rule would be ""wall is you"".

If both ""door is win"" and ""wall is you"" are active, then I can move through walls and go to the door. But creating these rules requires moving multiple blocks step by step.

This seems like a feasible plan, but requires careful navigation. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move the ""door"" rule from 5 right,2 up to 5 right,4 up:
   - Move up twice (one step each time).
2. Place the ""door"" next to ""is"" at 5 right,4 up and ""win"" at 6 right,4 up to create ""door is win"".
3. Move the ""wall"" rule from 4 left,2 up to 2 left,2 down (next to ""you"" rule):
   - Move right two steps, then down zero steps (already at same level).
4. Place ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""you"" to create ""wall is you"".
5. Now, I can move through walls and go to the door at 2 left,4 up, which is now win.

But executing this requires precise movement. Let's think about how to move the door first.

Starting position: Assume the player is near the bottom right, next to the wall 1 step right. To move the door rule up:

- From 5 right,2 up, move up to 5 right,3 up (assuming no wall there).
- Then move up to 5 right,4 up.
- Now, the door is at 5 right,4 up, next to ""is"" at 5 right,4 up and ""win"" at 6 right,4 up.
- To create ""door is win"", need to place the door next to ""is"" and","

8,right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal here is to figure out how to get to the ball, which is the win object. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". Since Baba is You, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects, the key is 3 steps left and 4 up. The door is 2 steps left and 4 up. There are walls around, and some rule blocks like 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', etc. The rule 'is' is located 5 steps right and 4 up. The ball (win) is 4 steps right and 1 up. 

First, I need to reach the ball. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the positions. The wall is 1 step right and 4 up. So, if I'm trying to go up from Baba's current position, there's a wall blocking the way. The rule 'is' is 5 steps right and 4 up, which is probably important because combining 'is' with other text blocks can change rules.

Maybe I can move the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can get the 'win' rule next to 'ball' and 'is', I could make ""ball is win"" again, but I already have that. Alternatively, maybe change ""baba is you"" to something else. Wait, but ""baba is you"" is a rule, so if I can move 'baba', 'is', and 'you' together, maybe I can make Baba a different property. 

Looking at the rule 'you' is at 2 steps left and 2 down. If I can get Baba next to 'you' and 'is', then maybe I can change what Baba is. But how do I move? The problem is that some objects are STOP, which I can't move. The walls are STOP, so I can't push them. 

Let me focus on moving the 'is' rule. The 'is' is at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move that towards the ball, maybe I can recreate a rule. But how do I move? The possible actions are up, down, left, right, idle. Wait, but in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not STOP. So, if I can push a text block (like 'is') that's not STOP, I can move it. But the 'is' here is a rule, so maybe it's movable unless there's a STOP rule.

Wait, the active rules don't mention that 'is' is stop. So maybe I can pick up the 'is' rule and move it. The goal is to reposition text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I move 'is' next to 'ball' and 'win', that would recreate ""ball is win"", but that's already the case. Maybe I need to create a rule that makes Baba able to move through walls or doors.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the ball would win. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'is' is at 5 right, 4 up. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. The 'win' rule is at 6 right, 4 up. It's a bit far. 

Let me think about the positions. The current player (Baba) is likely at the position defined by the 'baba' rule, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So, to move right or left, I need to adjust based on that. The 'is' rule is 5 steps right and 4 up from Baba. To get to the 'is' rule, I might need to move up and right. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. So moving up from the current position would hit that wall. 

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make a new rule. For example, if I can get 'baba', 'is', and 'key' together, then ""baba is key"" would make Baba a key, allowing me to unlock the door. But the key is 3 left and 4 up. So, maybe moving towards the key first. But how?

Alternatively, the door is 2 left and 4 up. If I can make the door not a stop, or make Baba able to pass through it. Since the current rules have 'door is door', which probably means door is a stop. If I can change 'door is door' to something else, like 'door is you', then stepping on the door would make it you, but I'm already you. Not sure. 

Another idea: The rule 'key' is at 6 right and 1 down. Maybe moving the 'key' to be under Baba so he can pick it up. But the key is a separate object; I need to move it by pushing it if it's not stop. Since the key's rule is 'key is key' (implied by the active rules), but the active rules don't have a specific stop on the key. So maybe I can move the key. 

But how do I move the key? I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, but I might need to push it if it's blocked. The key is 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can get Baba to that area, maybe he can pick up the key. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, focus on the 'is' rule at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move that 'is' next to 'ball' and 'win', but that's the original rule. Alternatively, move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make 'baba is win', which would make touching the ball win. 

But how to get 'is' there. The 'is' is already at 5 right, 4 up. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. So, the distance is quite large. Maybe the agent needs to move in such a way to reposition these blocks. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to make the wall not a stop. The 'wall' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. If I can change 'wall is stop' to something else. For example, move the 'stop' rule away from 'wall', so 'wall is not stop'. But the 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. So if I can move the 'stop' rule, then the wall's property would change. 

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The 'stop' is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can get there, maybe move it. But again, the path might be blocked. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the ball (which is win).
- Rules: Ball is win, Baba is you.
- Must manipulate rules by moving text blocks.

Possible steps:

1. Move the 'is' rule to create a new rule that makes Baba able to interact differently with walls or doors.
2. For example, create ""baba is push"" to push objects, but there's no 'push' rule. Alternatively, ""baba is move"" (but no such rule).
3. Alternatively, make the door not a stop. If door is not stop, you can walk through it.
4. To do that, need to change the door's property. The current rule is ""door is door"" (implied), but the active rules have ""rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So the 'door' text block is there, but the property is defined by other rules. The active rules include 'door' as a subject, but the actual property is determined by other rules. Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The 'door' is an object, but there's no rule defining door's property except maybe the 'stop' rule. Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. So perhaps ""door is stop"" is implied because there's a 'stop' rule nearby? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the door's property is determined by the closest 'rule' text block. If there's a 'stop' rule near the door, maybe it's considered stop. But the 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up, which is not directly near the door (which is 2 left, 4 up). So maybe the door is not stop. But I'm not sure how the rules work in terms of proximity. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is a stop because there's a 'stop' rule elsewhere. The active rules don't explicitly state ""door is stop"", but if there's a 'stop' rule in the vicinity, it might apply. This is unclear. 

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""door is you"", then stepping on the door would make it you, but since Baba is already you, that might not help. 

Another angle: The key is present. If I can get the key and use it on the door. But how? In Baba Is You, typically you need to push a key into a keyhole, but this level might be different. The door is at 2 left, 4 up. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can move the key to the door's location, maybe that opens it. But to do that, I need to move the key, which requires pushing it if possible. 

Assuming the key can be moved (since it's not defined as stop), I could move it towards the door. But the path from the key to the door is blocked by walls. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. The door is at 2 left, 4 up. There are walls at various positions, making it difficult to path. 

Alternatively, focus on the 'is' rule at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move that 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win', creating ""baba is win"", then touching the ball would make Baba win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule towards the 'baba' rule's location. 

The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. The 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. So moving the 'is' rule to the left and down. But how? The 'is' rule is a separate object; I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, possibly pushing it if it's blocked. 

The 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. To move it left, I would need to be to its left and move right, but that's not helpful. Wait, no. To move an object, you have to be adjacent to it and move in the direction you want to push it. For example, if I'm to the left of the 'is' rule and move right, I can push it right. 

Assuming Baba's current position is at the 'baba' rule's location (4 left, 3 down), the 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. So the distance is quite large. Maybe the agent needs to navigate towards the 'is' rule. 

But the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving up from Baba's position (4 left, 3 down) would go to 4 left, 2 down, which is a wall. So that's blocked. Moving right would go to 3 left, 3 down, which might be open. 

This is getting too vague. Maybe the best approach is to move the 'is' rule next to the 'baba' and 'win' rules. Since 'win' is at 6 right, 4 up, and 'baba' is at 4 left, 3 down, it's a bit scattered. 

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""key is win"", so picking up the key would make it win. But the key is at 6 right, 1 down. To do that, move 'key', 'is', and 'win' together. 

The 'win' rule is at 6 right, 4 up. The 'key' is at 6 right, 1 down. So vertically aligned. If I can move the 'is' rule down to 6 right, between key and win, then ""key is win"" would be created. 

The 'is' rule is currently at 5 right, 4 up. To move it down to 6 right, 1 down, that's a long way. But maybe possible by moving step by step. 

Alternatively, check if there's a shorter path. The 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. If I move it left to 4 right, 4 up, then down to 4 right, 3 up, etc., until reaching 6 right, 1 down. But each move requires being adjacent and pushing. 

This seems complicated. Maybe the immediate step is to move down from the current position to avoid walls. Previously, the assistant tried 'down' action, but it might not have worked. 

Alternatively, look for movable objects near Baba. The 'is' rule is 5 right, 4 up. If Baba can move right and up to reach it, but the path is blocked. 

Wait, the 'rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up' – no, the 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 up from the current position. So if Baba is at 0,0 (assuming), then the 'is' is at (5,4). The walls are at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), etc. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the 'is' rule next to 'ball' and 'win' to reinforce the rule, but that's already there. Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba able to move through walls by changing 'wall is stop' to 'wall is nothing'. To do that, need to move the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' rule. 

The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. The 'wall' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. If I can move the 'stop' rule away from the wall, then the wall's property would change. For example, move 'stop' to the right, so it's no longer adjacent to the wall. 

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The 'stop' is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can get to that position, move right, pushing the 'stop' rule to 1 left, 2 up. Then, the wall at 4 left, 2 up would no longer have a 'stop' rule nearby, so it might not be a stop anymore. 

But how to get to the 'stop' rule. From Baba's position (4 left, 3 down), moving left to 5 left, 3 down, then up to 5 left, 2 down, then left to 6 left, 2 down, etc. But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'key' to the door. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. The door is at 2 left, 4 up. If I can move the key towards the door, perhaps via pushing it over walls. But the path is blocked. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'you' to create a new rule. For example, 'baba is you' is already there, but if I can make 'baba is win', that would win the game. 

To do that, move 'is' next to 'baba' (4 left, 3 down) and 'win' (6 right, 4 up). The 'is' is at 5 right, 4 up. So moving the 'is' rule left and down. 

Each step requires moving the 'is' rule one step at a time. For example, from (5,4) to (4,4), then (3,4), etc., until reaching near 'baba' and 'win'. 

But this would take many steps. Given the previous failures, maybe the immediate action is to move down to avoid the wall blocking the upper path. 

Alternatively, move right to reach the 'is' rule. From Baba's position (assuming it's at the 'baba' rule's location: 4 left, 3 down), moving right would go to 3 left, 3 down. Is that a wall? The objects list shows walls at 1 step right and various positions, but not sure about 3 left. 

This is getting too ambiguous without a visual map. Based on the text descriptions, the best guess is to move towards the 'is' rule to manipulate it into creating a new rule that allows reaching the ball. 

Perhaps the first step is to move right to get closer to the 'is' rule. So action: right.

9,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, since Baba is You, I should be able to manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the Win object, which is currently the ball. But I need to see the map layout properly.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key that's 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up from where I am. The door is 3 steps left and 4 up. There's a wall directly 4 steps up. Then there's a rule 'is' at 4 steps right and 4 up, followed by 'win' at 5 right and 4 up, and 'wall' at 5 left and 3 up. The stop rule is at 3 left and 3 up. Lower down, there's another wall, then a rule 'door' at 4 right and 2 up. A rule 'is' at 2 left and 1 up, then a wall, rule 'ball' at 3 right and 1 up, another 'is' and 'win' rules further right. The key is now at 5 right. Lower down, there's a wall 1 step down, then rule 'baba' at 5 left and 2 down, along with 'is' and 'you' rules.

Hmm, the key might be needed to open the door, but the door is blocked by a wall 4 steps up. Wait, the wall at 4 steps up is probably preventing me from going up directly. But since I'm Baba, maybe I can change some rules. The 'is' rule at 4 right and 4 up could be moved to create a new rule. For example, if I can get to that 'is' rule and combine it with 'win' or something else, maybe I can change what's win.

Looking at the positions, the rule 'win' is at 5 steps right and 4 up. If I can move the 'is' rule next to 'win', maybe I can make a new rule like ""something IS WIN"". But the 'is' is at 4 right, 4 up, and 'win' is at 5 right, 4 up. So if I move right from the 'is' rule, I can attach it to 'win' to create a new rule. But first, I need to reach that 'is' rule.

But the path might be blocked. Let me check the obstacles. There's a wall 4 steps up, which is probably immovable because of the 'stop' rule. So I can't go through that. Maybe I need to go around. The door is 3 left and 4 up, but it's blocked by the wall. Alternatively, maybe I can use the key. The key is at 5 right, so if I can get there, but there's a wall at 1 step down and then a wall 2 steps down. Wait, the key is at 5 steps right, so maybe moving right multiple times. But I need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, since the 'you' rule is at 3 left and 2 down, maybe I can combine that with 'baba' to make 'baba you' or something. Wait, the rule 'baba' is at 5 left and 2 down. The 'is' rule is at 4 left and 2 down. So if I move the 'baba' rule next to the 'is' and 'you' rules, maybe I can change the rules. For example, moving 'baba' next to 'is' and 'you' to make ""baba IS YOU"", but isn't that already the case? The active rule is ""baba is you"", so maybe that's already set.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So perhaps I need to change the 'ball is win' rule. The 'ball' is at 3 right and 1 up, and there's an 'is' at 4 right and 1 up, followed by 'win' at 5 right and 1 up. So if I can move the 'is' rule next to 'ball', then 'win' to make ""ball IS WIN"", but that's already the case. Hmm, maybe I need to create a new rule that makes something else a win. For example, if I can make ""baba IS WIN"", then since I'm Baba, that would make me the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 5 left and 2 down. The 'is' rule is at 4 left and 2 down, and 'you' is at 3 left and 2 down. So if I can move the 'is' from 4 left to be next to 'baba' at 5 left, then place 'win' next to that, I can create ""baba IS win"". But the 'win' is further down? Wait, in the current observation, the 'win' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 up, but also another 'win' at 5 right and 1 up. Maybe there are multiple instances.

Alternatively, the 'win' rule at 5 right and 1 up is lower on the map. If I can get the 'is' rule from 4 right, 4 up, move it down to the area where 'baba' is at 5 left, 2 down. That might be a longer path. Maybe I need to go down first.

Looking at my current position, I'm probably at the starting point. Let's assume I'm at the bottom right where the key is moving. Wait, the key is now at 5 steps right, so maybe I'm to the left of that. The 'baba' rule is at 5 left and 2 down, so that's to the left and down from me. The 'is' rule is at 4 left and 2 down. So moving left and down towards the 'baba' and 'is' rules.

But how do I move? The previous attempts got me to 'down' actions, but maybe I need to adjust. Let's see. If I move down once, I might get closer to the area with 'baba', 'is', and 'you' rules. Then, move left to reach the 'is' rule, and then move the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Alternatively, maybe I need to get the 'win' rule closer to 'baba'. The 'win' at 5 right and 4 up is up high, but there's also a 'win' at 5 right and 1 up. If I can move that 'win' down next to 'baba', that could work. But moving objects that are 'stop' might be impossible. Wait, the rules specify that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. The 'stop' rule is at 3 left and 3 up. So most things can be moved except those marked 'stop'.

The 'baba' text block is probably movable unless there's a 'stop' on it. Looking at the objects, the 'baba' rule is at 5 left and 2 down. There's no 'stop' on it, so I can move it. Similarly, the 'is' and 'you' rules are movable.

So the plan could be:

1. Move towards the 'baba' rule at 5 left, 2 down.
2. Pick up the 'is' rule at 4 left, 2 down.
3. Place the 'is' next to 'baba' to form ""baba IS [something]"".
4. Then place a 'win' rule next to it to make ""baba IS win"".

Since the active rules include ""ball is win"", there's a 'win' rule at 5 right and 1 up. If I can move that 'win' down to near 'baba', then combining with the 'is' rule would make the new rule ""baba IS win"", making me (as Baba) the win condition.

So the steps would involve moving left to reach the 'is' rule, then moving down to reach the 'baba' area, then manipulating the rules.

But how to navigate? Let's see the current positions:

- 'baba' is 5 left, 2 down.
- 'is' is 4 left, 2 down.
- 'you' is 3 left, 2 down.
- 'win' is 5 right, 1 up.

Assuming I'm currently positioned somewhere, maybe near the key? The key is at 5 right, so if I've moved right multiple times, but previous actions resulted in defaults. Alternatively, perhaps I'm at the starting position.

Alternatively, maybe I should first move towards the 'is' rule at 4 left, 2 down. To get there, I need to move left and down. But how?

Wait, the movement is in steps up, down, left, right. Each action moves one step in that direction.

Given the current observation, the key is now at 4 steps left and 4 up. The door is 3 left, 4 up. There's a wall at 4 up. So the path up is blocked. Maybe I need to go around to the right or left.

But the immediate goal is to create a new rule making Baba the win. So focusing on that.

Let me try to outline the possible moves:

1. From current position (unknown, but assuming near the key or lower area), move left to reach the 'is' rule at 4 left, 2 down.

But how many steps left? The 'is' rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe I need to adjust based on the map.

Alternatively, considering the 'baba' rule is at 5 left, 2 down, perhaps I'm to the right of that. So moving left 5 steps and down 2 steps would get me there. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a closer path.

Alternatively, if I can move down first to get to the area with 'baba', 'is', and 'you' rules. Let's say I move down once, then left four times, then down once more. But without knowing the exact starting position, it's tricky.

Alternatively, look for the 'is' rule that's at 4 left, 2 down. If I can move left and down towards it, then pick it up, and move it next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Another thing to note: the 'win' rule at 5 right, 1 up is in the lower right area. To get there from the 'baba' area (5 left, 2 down), I would have to move right 10 steps and up 3 steps, which is a long way. Maybe there's another 'win' rule.

Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects list includes multiple 'win' rules: one at 6 steps right and 4 up, another at 6 steps right and 1 up. So perhaps the lower 'win' at 5 steps right and 1 up is more accessible.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the 'key' to open the door. The key is at 4 left and 4 up. If I can get the key, move it to the door, which is 3 left and 4 up. But the door is blocked by a wall at 4 up. So even if I have the key, the door is blocked. So that might not help.

Back to the rule manipulation. The key is at 5 steps right, so maybe I need to move right to get to it, but there's a wall at 1 step down and 2 steps down. Wait, the wall at 1 step down is probably below the current position. If I move right towards the key, but there's a wall in the way. Let's see:

Looking at the objects:

- wall 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down

So if I'm trying to move right towards the key at 5 right, but there's a wall 1 step down. Maybe that's a vertical wall? Not sure. The movement is step by step in directions, so perhaps the walls are in specific positions.

Alternatively, maybe the path to the key is blocked by a stop rule. The 'stop' rule is at 3 left and 3 up. So not directly in the way.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to prioritize the main goal: make Baba the win. To do that, create ""baba IS win"" by moving the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'.

The 'is' rule is currently at 4 left, 2 down. The 'baba' rule is at 5 left, 2 down. So moving the 'is' one step left to be adjacent to 'baba', then adding 'win' next to it.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left from current position to reach the 'is' rule at 4 left, 2 down.
2. Pick up the 'is' rule.
3. Move left one step to place it next to 'baba' at 5 left, 2 down.
4. Then find a 'win' rule and place it next to the 'is' to make ""baba IS win"".

The 'win' rule is at 5 right, 1 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, there's another 'win' at 6 right, 1 up. Maybe I can move that 'win' down to the area.

But moving the 'win' from 5 right, 1 up to 5 left, 2 down would require moving left 10 steps and down 1 step, which is impossible in one go. So perhaps there's another 'win' closer.

Wait, in the current objects list, there's a 'win' at 6 steps right and 4 step up, and another at 6 steps right and 1 step up. The lower one (6 right, 1 up) is closer. But still, to get there from the 'baba' area, it's a long way.

Alternatively, maybe use the existing 'win' rule that's part of the active rules. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The 'win' text block for the active rule is probably at 6 right, 4 up. But that's high up, blocked by walls.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe another approach: instead of making Baba the win, change the 'ball is win' to something else. For example, make ""door IS WIN"", then go through the door. But the door is blocked by a wall.

Alternatively, make ""key IS WIN"", then pick up the key and reach it to win. The key is at 4 left and 4 up. If I can make the key the win, then getting the key would solve the level.

To do that, I need to create ""key IS WIN"". The 'key' rule is at 6 right, 1 step down. The 'win' rule is at 6 right, 1 step up. So if I can move the 'is' rule next to 'key' and 'win', that would work.

The 'is' rule is at 4 right, 4 up. So from there, move down to 4 right, 1 up, then right to 5 right, 1 up, then place 'is' between 'key' and 'win'.

But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

From 'is' at 4 right, 4 up:

- Move down to 4 right, 3 up (but there's a wall at 4 up? No, the wall is at 4 step up, which is the same as the 'is' position. Wait, the wall is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So moving down from 4 right, 4 up would be to 4 right, 3 up. Is there a wall there? The objects list shows a wall at 4 step to the left and 2 step up, and others, but not at 4 right, 3 up. So maybe it's clear.

Then move right to 5 right, 3 up, then down to 5 right, 2 up, then right to 6 right, 2 up. But the 'win' is at 6 right, 1 up. So maybe move down to 6 right, 1 up and place 'is' there between 'key' and 'win'.

This seems possible. So the steps would be:

1. Move down from 'is' at 4 right, 4 up to 4 right, 3 up.
2. Move right to 5 right, 3 up.
3. Move down to 5 right, 2 up.
4. Move right to 6 right, 2 up.
5. Move down to 6 right, 1 up.
6. Place the 'is' rule between 'key' (at 6 right) and 'win' (at 6 right, 1 up), creating ""key IS WIN"".

Then, since the key is at 4 left, 4 up, I would need to go get it. But if ""key IS WIN"", then picking up the key would make me win. However, I need to be able to move to the key's location.

But the path to the key is blocked by the wall at 4 step up. The wall is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So if I'm at 6 right, 1 up, moving left to reach the key's area would require going through the wall. Unless there's a way around.

Alternatively, if I make ""key IS WIN"", then perhaps just being near the key would make me win. But I'm not sure. The rules might require touching the object. So I need to move to the key's position.

But the wall at 4 step up (1 step right, 4 up) blocks the path upwards. So to get to the key at 4 left, 4 up, I would have to go around the wall. Maybe go left from the current position, around the wall.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe the initial approach of making Baba the win is better, even if it requires more steps.

Alternatively, think about the 'you' rule. Since ""baba is you"", maybe combining 'baba' with 'win' directly.

Another idea: use the 'key' to unlock something, but I don't see a 'lock' rule. Alternatively, push objects, but I don't know if that's possible.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not stopped. So maybe I can push the door or the key if possible. But the door is blocked by a wall.

Hmm. Let's recap. The main goal is to create a rule where","

10,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. In Baba Is You, the goal is usually to get to the WIN object, but sometimes you have to change the rules to do that. The current active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means whatever I control (since Baba is You) can manipulate the rules, and the ball is what I need to reach.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. There's also a door 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up. There are several walls and rules scattered around. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are important because they can be moved to create new rules. My plan is probably to get to the key, use it to open the door, and then reach the ball which is the WIN condition.

But wait, the key is 4 steps left and 4 up from my current position. How do I move there? The walls might be blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout. There's a wall 4 steps up, and some other walls at lower steps. Also, there are rule `is` blocks at various positions. Since I'm Baba, I can move any text blocks that aren't STOP or other immovable properties. 

First, I need to navigate around the walls. If I move left or right, but there's a wall 1 step down, maybe I need to go up first. The door is to the left and up, but it's protected by a wall. Wait, the door is a rule `door` block, which I might need to change. But the key is more urgent because the door might require the key to open. 

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""key is you"", then I could control the key and use it to open the door. But right now, I'm Baba, so I can move the `is` blocks. 

So, the steps might be: move to the `is` block at 4 steps right and 4 up, then combine it with the key or door to create a new rule. Alternatively, move the key to the door. But how to do that? Since I can pick up text blocks, I need to move them adjacent to their target. 

Wait, the key is at 4 left and 4 up. If I move up 4 steps and left 4 steps, but there are walls in the way. Let me check the positions again. The wall 4 step up is directly up from where I am? Or is it in another direction? The walls are listed as ""wall 4 step up"", ""wall 3 step up"", ""wall 2 step up"", etc., so there's a wall forming a barrier upwards. Similarly, to the left and right, there are walls. 

Maybe I need to go around the walls. For example, move right to reach the `is` block at 4 steps right and 4 up. But there's a wall 1 step down, which might be blocking the path. Alternatively, move up first to get past the walls. 

Another approach: since ""ball is win"", I need to get to the ball. But the ball is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's a rule `win` at 5 steps right and 1 step up, which is adjacent to the ball. So if I can move the `win` rule to be under the ball, but the ball is already defined as win. Wait, the rule is ""ball is win"", so the ball is the win object. So maybe I just need to reach the ball. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the current position, if I'm at the same position as Baba, which is rule `baba` at 5 step left and 2 steps down. So my position is 5 left, 2 down. The key is 4 left and 4 up. So from my position, to get to the key, I need to move left 1 step and up 4 steps. But there's a wall at 4 step up. So maybe I have to go around. 

Alternatively, move right to reach the `is` blocks. Let's see: if I move right once, I'm at 4 left, 2 down. Then up to 4 left, 3 up. But there's a wall at 5 step left and 3 step up. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is to move the `is` block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I could pick up the key. But to do that, I need to move the `is` block next to Baba and the key. 

The key is at 4 left, 4 up. The rule `is` is at 4 steps right and 4 up. Wait, my position is 5 left, 2 down. So the `is` block is to the right and up from me. To reach it, I need to move right and up. But there are walls in the way. Maybe move right first: from 5 left, 2 down to 4 left, 2 down (moving right once). Then up to 4 left, 3 down? No, the directions are a bit confusing. Maybe the coordinate system is relative. 

Alternatively, focus on creating a rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, ""wall is stop"" is already there, but ""stop"" is a property that makes objects immovable. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is nothing"", then walls wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the `wall` rule. The `wall` rule is at 5 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that to a different position, maybe I can rewrite it. 

But how to get there? My current position is 5 left, 2 down. The `wall` rule is at 5 left, 3 up. So I need to move up 1 step and left 0. But there's a wall at 5 left, 3 up. Wait, the wall is at 5 left and 3 up, which is the same position as the `wall` rule? Or is the `wall` rule a separate object? The objects listed include ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 3 step up"", so that's a text block. The actual wall objects are separate, like ""wall 4 step up"". 

So the `wall` rule is a movable text block at 5 left, 3 up. To get there, I need to move up from my current position. From 5 left, 2 down, moving up once gets me to 5 left, 1 down. Then up again to 5 left, 0 down (assuming down is negative). But there's a wall at 5 left, 3 up, which might be blocking. Wait, maybe the directions are in steps relative to the player. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Perhaps a better approach is to move towards the `is` block at 4 steps right and 4 up. If I can pick that up and place it next to the key, then I can create ""key is you"", making the key controllable. Then I could pick up the key and use it on the door. 

But first, I need to navigate to that `is` block. From my position (5 left, 2 down), moving right would decrease the left steps. So moving right once gets me to 4 left, 2 down. Then up to 4 left, 1 down. Then up again to 4 left, 0 down. But there's a wall at 1 step up, which is 4 left, 1 up. So I can't go past that. 

Alternatively, move up first. From 5 left, 2 down, moving up to 5 left, 1 down. Then right to 4 left, 1 down. Then up to 4 left, 0 down. But again, walls might be in the way. 

This is tricky. Maybe the key is not the immediate priority. The ball is already the win condition, so perhaps I just need to reach it. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. There's a rule `win` at 5 steps right and 1 step up, which is adjacent to the ball. If I can move the `win` rule to be under the ball, but it's already defined as ""ball is win"". So maybe I just need to get to the ball's position. 

The path to the ball: from my position (5 left, 2 down), moving right 4 steps and up 1 step. But there are walls at various points. For example, wall at 4 step up, 3 step up, etc. So maybe I need to find a way around. 

Alternatively, use the `is` blocks to create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing"", then walls wouldn't block. But to do that, I need to move the `stop` rule. The `stop` rule is at 3 step left and 3 step up. 

This is getting really complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move to a nearby `is` block to start creating new rules.
2. Combine the `is` block with the key to make ""key is you"", allowing me to pick up the key.
3. Use the key on the door to open it.
4. Navigate past the door to the ball (win condition).

But how to execute this? Let's break it down:

- Current position: rule `baba` at 5 step left and 2 steps down.
- Nearest `is` block: 4 step right and 4 step up (from my position?), but that's probably not adjacent.
- Alternatively, there's an `is` block at 1 step left. Maybe move to that first.

Wait, the `is` blocks are at various positions. Let's list them:

- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up (from the initial observation, but after some moves, positions might have changed).
- In the latest observation, there's a rule `is` at 4 steps to the right and 4 step up, and another at 1 step to the left.

Assuming the latest observation, the `is` blocks are at:

- 4 steps right, 4 up (from where? Maybe from the player's position)
- 1 step left.

To reach the `is` block at 1 step left, I need to move left once. From 5 left, 2 down to 4 left, 2 down (moving left once). Then, maybe up or down? If I can get adjacent to that `is` block, I can move it.

Once I have an `is` block, I can move it next to the key (4 left, 4 up) and create ""key is you"". Then, I can pick up the key and go to the door.

Alternatively, move the `is` block to the ball's location to reinforce ""ball is win"", but that's already the case.

Another angle: since ""baba is you"", I am Baba. If I can make ""baba is win"", then I would be the win condition, and touching any space would win. But to do that, I need to move the `win` rule next to Baba.

The `win` rule is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. From my position (5 left, 2 down), moving right 10 steps and up 3 steps seems impossible due to walls. Not practical.

Back to the key and door. The door is at 3 step left and 4 step up. There's a rule `door` at 4 steps right and 2 step up. Maybe I can change the door's rule. For example, make ""door is key"", so pressing the door requires a key. But I already have a key, so if I can place it near the door.

But how to get the key there? If I can make the key controllable (by making ""key is you""), then I can pick up the key and move it to the door.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the `is` block at 1 step left.
2. Move it next to the key (4 left, 4 up) to create ""key is you"".
3. Now, as the key, move it to the door's position (3 left, 4 up).
4. Open the door and proceed to the ball.

But navigating past the walls is the challenge. Let's think about movement.

From current position (5 left, 2 down):

- To reach the `is` block at 1 step left, move left once to 4 left, 2 down.
- Then, move up to 4 left, 1 down, then to 4 left, 0 down, but there's a wall at 1 step up (4 left, 1 up). So maybe can't go that way.
- Alternatively, move up from 5 left, 2 down to 5 left, 1 down (but is there a wall there? The objects list has walls at 4 step up, 3 step up, etc., but not sure about the exact positions).

This is getting too vague without a visual map. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the nearest `is` block to start manipulating rules. For example, if there's an `is` block at 1 step left, moving left once to get there.

So, the action would be ""left"".

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which right now is a ball. But the active rules say ""ball is win,"" so touching the ball should win the game. Also, ""baba is you,"" which means I can control Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key that's 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up from my current position. There's a door 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up. The walls are positioned around, and there are rule text blocks around. The ""is"" rules are scattered, which might be important for creating or changing rules.

First, I need to navigate to the key to possibly unlock the door. But the door is blocked by walls. Wait, the door is a ""door"" object, and there's a rule ""door is door"" maybe? Not sure. Also, there's a ""rule `is`"" block 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule and combine it with other text blocks, I might be able to change some rules.

But right now, I'm controlled by ""baba is you,"" so I can move around. The walls are marked as ""wall"" and there's a ""stop"" rule. So if I try to move into a wall or a ""stop"" object, I can't pass. Let me check the positions again.

The ball is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. To get there, I might need to go around the walls. But the path might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to make a path. For example, if I can make ""door is key"" or something, but I don't have the key yet.

Wait, the key is 3 steps left and 4 steps up. So from my current position, I need to move left three times and up four times. But there are walls in the way. Let me visualize the map:

- There's a wall 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So if I'm moving up, I have to check the path. The ""rule `is`"" is 5 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" to combine with ""door"" or ""key""?

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""win"" rule to make something else the win condition. But the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can change ""ball is win"" to ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make me win. But how?

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" text block and the ""win"" text block and combine them with an ""is"" rule. But the ""is"" rules are scattered. Let's see:

There's a ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win,"" I could change the rule. But moving that ""is"" would require me to navigate around walls. Maybe I can go right, right, right, right, up, up, up, up to reach that ""is"" block. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, wall 1 step right and 4 up is in the way. So maybe I need to find another path.

Alternatively, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that one. To get there, I need to move left once and up once. But is that possible? Let's check the surrounding objects. If moving left from my current position (assuming standard starting point, but the exact position isn't specified here), but given the objects listed, maybe I'm near the right side of the map.

Wait, the key is at 6 steps to the right, which might mean I'm on the left side. The walls are to the right and left. This is a bit confusing without a visual map, but I'll proceed with the info given.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push objects. But the rules say ""stop"" is a property, so if something is ""stop,"" I can't move it. The walls are likely ""stop,"" so I can't push them. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe I can move that ""stop"" rule to disable the stop property.

But how? To move a rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, provided I'm not blocked by a ""stop."" Let's see. The ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 4 up: if I can get to that position, I can combine it with other rules. But getting there requires moving right past walls. For example, there's a wall 1 step right and 4 up, so moving right from my current position would hit that wall. Unless there's a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can go down to the lower part of the map where the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba"" the win condition, then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" text block, the ""win"" text block, and an ""is"" rule together.

Looking at the objects: ""rule `baba`"" is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. ""rule `win`"" is 6 steps right and 1 step up. ""rule `is`"" is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move the ""baba"" rule to be next to ""win"" and ""is,"" then ""baba is win"" would be created, making me win upon touching.

But how to move those blocks? Let's think step by step. To move the ""rule `baba`"" block from 4 steps left and 3 steps down to a position where it's adjacent to ""win"" and ""is,"" I need to navigate there. From the current observation, the ""rule `baba`"" is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So from my current position, moving left 4 times and down 3 times. But there are walls in the way. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down"" might be blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a path through other areas. This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: Since the key is present, maybe I need to get it to unlock the door. The door is 2 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can push the door with the key, but doors are usually ""stop,"" so I can't push them. Alternatively, if I make the door not a stop, but that requires changing the rules.

Wait, there's a ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""door"" rule and combine it with another rule, maybe I can change its properties. For example, if I make ""door is not stop,"" then the door wouldn't block movement. But how to do that? I need to find an ""is not"" rule, which I don't have. The available rules are ""is"" and the defined properties.

Another idea: The ""key"" is nearby. If I can pick up the key and use it to move something. But in Baba Is You, typically you can't pick up objects; you can only move text blocks. So the key is probably a regular object that you can step on, but it doesn't do anything unless there's a rule about keys.

Since the goal is to touch the ball (which is win), maybe the fastest way is to reach the ball. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The path there might be blocked by walls. Let me check the path:

From my current position, moving right 4 times and up 1 time. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up (wait, no, the wall is 1 step to the right and 4 step up in the initial observation). Wait, the current observation after some moves might have changed. Let me check the latest observation.

In the last observation before the current one, the key is at 4 step left and 4 step up, door at 3 step left and 4 up, wall 4 step up. So the wall is directly above the door and key. The ""rule `is`"" is at 4 steps right and 4 up. So to get to the ball at 4 steps right and 1 step up, I need to go right 4 times and down 3 times. But there's a wall at 4 step up, so maybe I have to go around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" at 4 steps right and 4 up to a different position. If I can move that ""is"" rule down to where the ball and win rule are, I could create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to make ""ball is win"" again, but that's already the case. Not helpful.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" text block, the ""win"" text block, and an ""is"" rule together. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""rule `win`"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. The ""rule `is`"" is at 5 steps right and 1 step up.

So maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" from 5 steps right and 1 step up to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's see the positions:

- ""rule `baba`"": 4 left, 3 down
- ""rule `win`"": 6 right, 1 up
- ""rule `is`"": 5 right, 1 up

To bring ""is"" next to both ""baba"" and ""win,"" I need to move it left and down. But how? From its current position (5 right, 1 up), moving left 5 times would get to the ""baba"" rule, but there's a wall at 1 step right, so maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, moving down from ""rule `is`"" at 5 right, 1 up to 5 right, 0 up, etc., but need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left and 1 step up (mentioned in previous observations) to a better position. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of the simplest solution. Since the ball is the win condition, maybe I just need to reach it. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Let's check if that's reachable.

From current position, moving right 4 times and up 1 time. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up (from the initial observation, but positions might have changed). Wait, in the latest observation, the wall is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So if I'm trying to move up from my current position, I might hit that wall. Unless there's a different path.

Alternatively, maybe I can go around the wall by moving left or right first. For example, move left to avoid the wall, then up, then right. But I need to know the exact layout.

Another angle: The ""rule `key`"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe I need to get the key and use it to unlock something. But how? Unlocking usually requires a key object, but there's no rule about that here. The door is a door, but without a rule like ""key unlocks door,"" I can't use the key.

Wait, the door is at 2 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can push the door out of the way, but since it's a stop object, I can't. Unless I change its property. For example, if I make ""door is not stop,"" then I could move through it. To do that, I need to create a rule ""door is not stop."" But I don't have a ""not"" rule. The available rules are ""is.""

Alternatively, if I can remove the ""stop"" property from door. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the door's stop property would be removed. But moving the ""stop"" rule would require navigating to its position.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to manipulate the ""is"" rules to create a new rule that allows passage. For example, making ""baba is push"" so I can push objects, but I don't have a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move to the ball by finding a path that's not blocked by walls. Let's see the path to the ball:

Ball is at 4 right, 1 up. Current position isn't specified, but assuming I'm somewhere else. Let's assume I'm near the left side. To get to the ball, move right 4 times and up 1. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. So moving right once gets me to the wall. Then I can't go further right. So maybe I need to go around the wall by moving down first, then right, then up.

But where am I starting? If the wall is at 1 step right and 4 up, and the ball is at 4 right and 1 up, perhaps the path is:

1. Move down from the wall's position to avoid it.
2. Move right past the wall.
3. Move up to the ball.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe the key is necessary to unlock the door, but without a rule, it's useless.

Wait, in the latest observation, the key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. The door is at 2 steps left and 4 steps up. Maybe if I can get the key and bring it to the door, but again, without a rule, that doesn't help.

Another Idea: The ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule down to the area where the ball and win rule are, I could create a new rule. For example, placing ""is"" next to ""ball"" and ""win"" to reinforce ""ball is win,"" but that's already the case. Alternatively, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win.""

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 4 step up.
2. Move down to align it with ""baba"" and ""win"" rules.

But how to navigate there? Let's see:

From current position (unknown), but assuming the ""rule `is`"" is at 5 right, 4 up. To get there, move right 5 times and up 4 times. But there are walls in the way. For example, wall at 1 step right and 4 up. So moving right 5 times from my current position would hit that wall at step 1. Therefore, this path is blocked.

Alternative path: Find another ""is"" rule. There's one at 1 step left and 1 step up. Maybe use that to create a new rule. For example, move that ""is"" to near ""baba"" and ""win.""

Let's try:

1. Move to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 left and 1 up.
2. Move right to align with ""baba"" (which is 4 left and 3 down) and ""win"" (6 right and 1 up). This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move to the ball. If the path is blocked by walls, perhaps I can push the walls if they're not ""stop."" But the walls have the ""wall"" property and ""stop,"" so I can't.

Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is at 4 step left and 3 step up. If I can change that rule to something else, like ""wall is push,"" then I could push the walls. But how?

To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push,"" I need to move the ""wall"" text block, the ""stop"" text block, and an ""is"" rule. For example:

1. Move the ""wall"" rule from 4 left, 3 up to be next to ""stop"" and ""is.""
2. Create a new rule ""wall is push,"" allowing me to push walls.

But this seems involved. Let's see if there's a quicker way.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is move,"" but I don't have a ""move"" rule. The default is that you can move, but maybe not.

Another Idea: The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 step left and 2 step down. If I can make ""you"" be something else, like ""baba,"" then I could have multiple yous. But not sure.

Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you"" and ""ball is win."" If I can create a new rule like ""key is you,"" then touching the key would also make me win. But the key is at 6 steps right, so maybe that's a way. To do that, I need to move the ""key"" text block, the ""you"" text block, and an ""is"" rule together.

The ""key"" is at 6 right, the ""you"" rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 5 right, 1 up. This seems challenging.

Perhaps the simplest solution I can think of is to move towards the ball, avoiding walls. Let's assume that moving right and down is possible.

For example:

1. Move right until I hit a wall, then try another direction.
2. Since the ball is to the right and down, maybe move right, then down, then right again.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard. Alternatively, the correct action is to move right to get closer to the ball, or down to avoid the wall.

Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to move right to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 1 step up, then use it to create the ""baba is win"" rule.

So, the sequence would be:

- Move right to reach the ""is""","

12,left,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to figure out how to get to the ball because the active rule says ""ball is win"". But how do I get there? First, I should look at the current state of the level.

The player is controlled by Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"" is a rule. So I'm Baba. The key is 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up from my current position. Then there's a door 2 steps left and 4 up. But there are walls blocking the path. There's a wall 1 step to the right and 4 up. Hmm, maybe I can move around that by going left or down?

Wait, the rules also include ""rule `is`"" blocks. Those are important because I can move them to create new rules. For example, if I can get to the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""you"", maybe I can change the rule to make Baba something else. Or maybe combine the ""is"" with ""key"" and ""win"" to make the key win?

Looking at the objects again: there's a rule `is` at 5 steps right and 4 up. That's near the wall. The ball is 4 steps right and 1 step up. The key is at 6 steps right. There's also a rule `is` at 5 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe if I move that ""is"" block next to ""ball"" and ""win"", I can change the rule to make the ball something else. But right now, ""ball is win"" is active, so touching the ball would win, but maybe the door is behind a wall.

Alternatively, maybe I need to get the key first. The key is 3 left and 4 up. But there's a wall at 4 step up. So I can't go directly up. Maybe I have to go around the walls. Let me map this out.

Current position (assuming I'm Baba at 4 left and 3 steps down? Wait, the observation shows ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down"". So Baba's position is at 4 left and 3 down. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I need to reach the ball, but the path is blocked.

Looking at the objects around: there's a rule `is` at 5 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win"", maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win"", which would let me win by getting the key instead. But how to move the ""is"" block?

To move an object, it can't be tagged as ""STOP"" or similar. The walls are ""STOP"", but the ""is"" blocks aren't. So maybe I can move the ""is"" block from 5 right, 4 up to somewhere else. For example, moving it down to where the ""key"" is at 6 right. Then create a rule ""key is win"".

But first, how to reach that ""is"" block. Let's see. From Baba's position (4 left, 3 down), to get to the ""is"" block at 5 right, 4 up. The direction would be right and up. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. So maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, maybe move left to get to the ""is"" block at 1 step left and 1 step up. Wait, there's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can get there, maybe I can combine it with other rules.

Alternatively, look for other movable objects. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable. Let me check the positions again:

- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up

So multiple ""is"" blocks. Maybe the key is at 6 steps right, so if I can create a rule ""key is win"", then getting the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move an ""is"" next to ""key"" and ""win"".

The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. The key is at 6 steps right. So if I can move an ""is"" block between them, say at 5 steps right and 4 step up (but that's blocked by a wall), or maybe at 6 steps right and 1 step up where there's a rule `is` already. Hmm.

Wait, there's a rule `is` at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The ""win"" is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. The key is at 6 steps right. So if I can move that ""is"" from 5 right, 1 up to 6 right, 1 up, that would be next to ""win"" and ""key"". But how?

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from 5 right, 4 up down to 5 right, 1 up. Then create ""key is win"" by placing the ""is"" between them. But how to move it down?

Baba's current position is 4 left, 3 down. To get to the ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up, need to move right 4 steps and up 3 steps. But the path is blocked by walls. The wall is at 1 step right and 4 up, which is on the way. So maybe another approach.

Looking at the other ""is"" blocks. The one at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that to where the key is. From Baba's position (4 left, 3 down), moving left 1 step and up 1 step would take me to that ""is"" block. Then, I can move it right towards the key.

So steps:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up.
2. Then move right to carry the ""is"" block towards the key at 6 right.
3. Once the ""is"" is next to ""key"" and ""win"", create the rule ""key is win"".
4. Then go to the key and touch it to win.

But how to navigate without hitting walls. Let's see the walls:

- There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up.
- Walls at steps right and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up.
- Walls at 1 step right, 1 step down, 2 steps down.

So moving right from Baba's position (4 left, 3 down) would be towards the walls. Maybe better to move left first.

Baba is at 4 left, 3 down. So to get to the ""is"" at 1 left, 1 up:

- Move left once (to 3 left, 3 down).
- Then up once (3 left, 2 down).
- Then left again to 2 left, 2 down.
- Then up to 2 left, 1 down.
- Then left to 1 left, 1 down.
- Now up to 1 left, 0 down (assuming directions are relative). Wait, maybe the steps are in grid coordinates. Need to clarify.

Alternatively, each ""step"" is a movement in one direction. The key is 3 steps left and 4 up from the current position. So the current position is key's position minus 3 left and 4 up. Similarly for other objects.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to focus on the immediate surrounding. The ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up is adjacent to Baba's current position? Let's see:

Baba is at 4 left, 3 down. The ""is"" block is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So from Baba's position, moving left once brings him to 3 left, 3 down. Then moving up once brings him to 3 left, 2 down. Then left to 2 left, 2 down, up to 2 left, 1 down, left to 1 left, 1 down, then up to 1 left, 0 down. But the ""is"" is at 1 left, 1 up. Hmm, maybe the coordinates are offset. Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" is one step to the left and one step up from Baba's current position. So if Baba moves left and up, he can pick up the ""is"" block.

Once he has the ""is"" block, he can move it to where the key and win are. The key is at 6 steps right, and win is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. So placing the ""is"" between key and win would make ""key is win"".

Then, once that rule is active, Baba can go to the key (which is now win) and touch it to win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left and up to get the ""is"" block.
2. Carry the ""is"" block to the key's location.
3. Place the ""is"" next to key and win to create the new rule.
4. Move to the key and touch it.

But how to move the ""is"" block without hitting walls. The path from Baba's position to the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up: need to move left and up. But are there walls in between?

Looking at the walls:

- Wall 1 step to the right and 4 up (which is not on the way).
- Walls at 1 step right and 3, 2, 1 up (also not on the path to the left/up).
- So assuming the path is clear to the left and up from Baba's position.

So moving left once, then up once to reach the ""is"" block. Then carry it right towards the key.

After picking up the ""is"", move right multiple times past the walls. Wait, there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, but that's higher up. When moving right from the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up, the path to the key at 6 right would pass through some walls?

Looking at the walls on the right side:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 up (already known)
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 up
- wall 1 step to the right (at same level as key?)

So moving right from the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up, the path to the key at 6 right would have walls at 1 step right in various up positions. But the key is at 6 steps right, which is far to the right. So maybe the way is blocked by multiple walls on the right side.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way around the walls by moving down first. For example, from the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up, move right and down to avoid walls.

Alternatively, create another rule to make walls passable. For example, ""wall is stop"" is already there, but if we can change it to ""wall is nothing"", then walls wouldn't block. But how?

To do that, we'd need to move an ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and change its property. For example, move an ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""nothing"", making ""wall is nothing"". But where is ""nothing"" located? Not sure if that's an object.

Alternatively, ""stop"" is a property. If we can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is not stop"", but that requires redefining the rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the priority is to first create the ""key is win"" rule.

So, after getting the ""is"" block, move it to the key's location. The key is at 6 steps right. From the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up, moving right 6 times would get to the key. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 1 step right, there's a wall at 4 up, but that's higher up. When moving right from 1 left, 1 up, the path down to the key's level (assuming the key is at the same down level) might be clear.

Wait, the key is at 6 steps right, and the ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. So the key is below the ""win"" rule. So to place the ""is"" between key and win, Baba needs to be at 6 steps right, between the key and the win rule.

But how to get there without hitting walls. There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, but that's on the upper part. The lower part towards the key might be clearer.

Alternatively, maybe the key is accessible by moving down from the ""is"" block. For example, after picking up the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up, move down to avoid walls, then right to the key.

This is tricky. Maybe the best action right now is to move towards the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up to pick it up. Then, once have the ""is"", move right towards the key, avoiding walls by moving down if necessary.

But the user asked for the next action. Given the current observation, the immediate action should be to move left to reach the ""is"" block. Because the previous actions were ""down"" and ""left"", but maybe those didn't work due to walls or incorrect reasoning.

So the next action is to move left once to get to the ""is"" block at 1 left, 1 up.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, I'm Baba because of the ""baba is you"" rule. My goal is usually to reach the ball, but since ""ball is win"", touching the ball should make me win.

Looking at the map, the key is 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up from my current position. There's a door 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. There are walls blocking some paths. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are important because I can move them to create or change rules.

First, I need to get to the ball. The path to the ball is blocked by walls on the right. The door is there, but I don't have a key yet. The key is 2 steps left and 4 up. Wait, maybe I need to move the key closer? But the key is an object, and I can only move things that aren't stopped. Let me check if anything is stopping the key. Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `key`"" 7 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe that's making the key immovable? But ""key"" is a subject here, not a property. Wait, the rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""rule `key`"" is probably a text block that says ""KEY IS [something]"". But in the current active rules, I don't see any rule defining the key's properties. So maybe the key is movable unless there's a ""stop"" rule. Let me check for ""stop"" rules. There's a ""rule `stop`"" 1 step to the left and 3 step up. But that's a text block saying ""STOP IS [something]"". Without knowing the exact property, it might not be affecting the key directly.

Wait, the walls are there. To get to the key, which is 2 steps left and 4 up, I need to move left and up, but the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 1 step right and 4 step up might be part of the obstacle. Maybe I can push the wall if it's not stopped. Let me check if the wall has a ""stop"" property. The active rules include ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up"", which probably means ""WALL IS STOP"" or something. So walls are stoppable. That means I can't push them. So I can't go through the walls.

Alternative approach: Maybe I can rearrange the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" or ""YOU IS BALL"", then I could win by touching something else. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text blocks. There are several ""rule `is`"" blocks around. Let's see their positions.

The ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 4 step up is part of ""ball is win"". If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", then I can change the win condition. Similarly, the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left is near the key. Maybe if I move that ""is"" to make ""baba is win"", that would help.

Wait, the player is Baba (since ""baba is you""). So if I can make ""baba is win"", then just touching Baba (myself) would make me win. That's a possible solution. But how to do that? The existing rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". To create ""baba is win"", I need to take an ""is"" text block and place it between ""baba"" and ""win"".

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down. And a ""rule `win`"" at 6 steps to the right and 4 step up. There's also a ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps to the right and 4 step up, which is part of ""ball is win"". If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" and ""win"", that would work. But how to get there?

The player is currently at a position where they need to navigate through the map. The walls are blocking direct movement. The key is 2 steps left and 4 up, but behind walls. Maybe the key isn't necessary if I can change the rules instead.

Another idea: The door is 1 step left and 4 up. To open the door, I need a key. The key is 2 steps left and 4 up. But if I can't reach the key because of walls, maybe I can use text blocks to make the door passable or remove the walls.

Alternatively, if I can push a ""stop"" rule away, maybe the walls become movable. But ""stop"" is a property, and the walls are defined as ""wall is stop"" perhaps. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, the walls might become passable.

But this seems complicated. Let's focus on moving the ""is"" text block. The ""rule `is`"" at 5 steps right and 4 step up is part of ""ball is win"". If I can move this ""is"" to connect ""baba"" and ""win"", that would create ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from its current position to between ""baba"" and ""win"".

The player's current position isn't clear from the observation, but based on the objects listed, perhaps the player is near the bottom left. The ""rule `baba`"" is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down from somewhere. Maybe the player is near there.

To move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. The ""is"" block is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. The player needs to be next to it and move towards it. For example, if the player is to the left of the ""is"" block, moving right would push the ""is"" block to the right.

But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the layout. There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 step up. So moving up from there would hit a wall. Maybe the player needs to go around the wall by moving left or right first.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Identify the positions of the important text blocks: ""baba"", ""win"", and ""is"" rules.
2. Determine if the player can move to the location of the ""is"" block that's part of ""ball is win"".
3. Once adjacent, move in the direction that pushes the ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" and ""win"".

Alternatively, if the player can create a new rule ""baba is win"" by combining existing text blocks.

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. If the player can make ""you"" be ""win"", then since Baba is you, that would work. But again, this requires rearranging text blocks.

Considering the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" block at 5 steps right and 4 step up to try and push it towards the ""baba"" and ""win"" text blocks. But I need to check if that's possible given the current map layout.

Alternatively, move left to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step left, which might be near the key area. But the key is behind walls.

Wait, the key is now at 2 steps left and 4 up, which is closer. Maybe obtaining the key first would allow movement through a door, but there's no door nearby the key. The door is 1 step left and 4 up, which is next to the key. So if I get the key, I can open the door and proceed.

But how to get the key? The key is at 2 steps left and 4 up. The player needs to move left and up, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 step up. So the path is blocked. Maybe push the wall if it's not stopped. But the wall is probably stopped because of the ""rule `wall`"" text block making it a stop.

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to change the rules first. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching myself would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from ""ball is win"" to connect ""baba"" and ""win"".

The ""is"" block is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 4 step up. So the distance between ""baba"" and ""win"" is quite big. Maybe moving the ""is"" block to the left and down to connect them.

But the player's current position isn't specified, so it's hard to say. However, based on the previous observations, the player might be near the bottom left, needing to move up and right to reach the ""is"" block.

Another possibility: The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""you"" into ""win"", then since Baba is you, that would work. To do that, take the ""is"" block next to ""you"" (if any) and move it to connect ""you"" and ""win"".

But looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down, which is near the ""rule `you`"" at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that ""is"" block to connect ""you"" and ""win"", that could work.

The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. So the distance is significant. Maybe this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step up is near the ""rule `ball`"" at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" and ""win"", that would be ideal.

But again, the player's position is unclear. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, I think the best bet is to try moving the ""is"" block that's part of ""ball is win"" to connect ""baba"" and ""win"". To do that, the player needs to move towards that ""is"" block and push it in the direction towards ""baba"" and ""win"".

Assuming the player is near the ""ball is win"" rule, moving left or right to get adjacent to the ""is"" block and then pushing it towards the ""baba"" and ""win"" text blocks. The action would involve moving in the direction of the ""is"" block to push it.

After several failed attempts, maybe the correct action here is to move left to get closer to the necessary text blocks or to push an ""is"" block.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is currently a ball. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, since Baba is You, I can manipulate the rules by moving the text blocks.

First, I need to look at the objects on the map. There's a key somewhere, a door, walls, and various rules like 'is', 'win', 'wall', and 'stop'. The key might be needed to open a door, but right now the door's position isn't clear from the observation. Let me check again.

Looking at the objects: the key is 1 step to the left and 4 steps up. The door is 4 steps up. There are walls blocking paths, especially to the right. The rule blocks like 'is' and 'win' are positioned towards the right side. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. 

Since I'm Baba (because ""baba is you""), I can move around unless stopped. The walls are defined as 'stop', so I can't move into them. The goal is the ball, which is also the 'win' condition. But to get there, I need to navigate past the walls and maybe interact with the rules.

The key is up at 4 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can get there, maybe I can use it on a door. But the door's location isn't explicitly stated, but there's a rule 'door' at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. That might be the door's position. However, moving right is blocked by walls and 'stop' rules. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to change the rules. For example, if I can move the 'is' text block next to 'baba' and 'you', maybe I can make Baba a different thing. Like, making Baba ""win"" so that touching Baba itself wins. Or making ""you"" something else so that I can become that. 

Looking at the current setup, the 'is' rule is at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move that 'is' next to 'baba' and 'you', maybe I can change the rules. But moving the 'is' block requires that it's not stopped. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps up, which might not block the 'is' movement. 

Wait, the 'stop' property applies to objects that are defined as stop. So any object with 'stop' can't be moved. Looking at the objects, the walls are defined as 'wall' and they have 'stop' as a rule. So I can't move the walls. But the 'is', 'win', 'key', 'door' rules are separate text blocks that I can move if they're not stopped. 

The 'is' rule at 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up might be movable. If I can move that 'is' next to 'baba' and 'you', I could create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or ""you is win"". That would change the game dynamics. 

But how to reach that 'is' block? The current position of Baba is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Let me map out the positions. If I'm at, say, the starting point, moving left would take me towards the 'baba' rule. Moving right is blocked by walls. Up might be possible, but there are walls at 3 steps up. 

Wait, the observation lists objects with their positions relative to the player. For example, ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down"" means the 'baba' text block is 4 steps left and 3 down from the player's current position. So the player is somewhere, and these objects are in different relative directions. 

The player's current position isn't given, but the objects are described relative to it. So to navigate, I need to figure out which direction to move to reach the 'is' blocks or the key. 

The 'is' block at 5 steps right and 4 steps up might be the key target. If I can move there and combine it with other rules, I can change the game. But moving right 5 steps might be blocked by walls. Let's check the walls. 

There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps up. Then another at 3 steps right and 4 steps up. So moving right from the player's position, steps right 1 and 3 are walls. The 'is' block is at 5 steps right, which is beyond the walls. So to get there, I need to go around the walls. 

But how? The player might need to move up first, then around the walls. Let's think step by step. 

Current active rules: ball is win, baba is you. So the player (Baba) can move around unless stopped by walls. The goal is to reach the ball (which is win). 

Possible actions: Move towards the ball, but the path might be blocked. Alternatively, move the 'is' text block to create a new rule. For example, if I can move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win', making ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make you win. 

Looking at the objects: 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. So to connect them with an 'is', I need to move the 'is' block from 5 steps right and 4 steps up to between them. But that might require navigating around obstacles. 

Alternatively, the 'is' block at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that 'is' next to 'baba' and 'you', maybe create ""baba is you"" again, but that's redundant. 

Another idea: If I can make ""you"" something else, like ""key"", then touching the key would make me win. But the 'you' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. 

Alternatively, make ""win"" be ""baba"", so touching Baba wins. To do that, move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and 'is'. 

But the 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. These are in opposite directions. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to get the key and use it on the door. The key is 1 step left and 4 steps up. If I can reach it, move up 4 steps left to get the key. But the path might be blocked. 

Let me visualize the map. The player is at the center. To the left are walls and the key. Upwards, there are walls at certain steps. To the right, there are more walls and rules. 

If I move left, I might hit a wall at 1 step left. So maybe I need to move up first, then left. For example: move up to avoid the wall, then left. But the 'stop' rule is at 3 steps up, which might be a wall. 

Alternatively, move down to get to a clearer path. The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, so moving down 3 steps might reach there. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the key is 1 step left and 4 steps up. So from the player's position, moving left 1 and up 4 would get to the key. But between there are walls at 3 steps up (step right 3, 4 up). So maybe the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, use the 'is' blocks to redefine rules. For example, move 'is' to create ""key is win"", making the key the win object. Then pick up the key to win. 

The key is at 1 left, 4 up. The 'is' block is at 5 right, 4 up. To connect key, is, win: key is win. So move the 'is' from 5 right,4 up to between key (1 left,4 up) and win (6 right,4 up). But the key is left of the player, and the 'is' is to the right. This would require moving the 'is' block left past the walls. 

But moving left from the 'is' at 5 right,4 up would pass through walls at 3 right,4 up and 1 right,4 up. So that's not possible. 

Hmm. Maybe another approach. The 'you' rule is at 2 left, 2 down. If I can make ""you"" be ""door"", then pushing the door would move it, but the door is a 'stop' object. Or if ""you"" is ""key"", then picking up the key. 

Alternatively, make ""baba is door"", then maybe move the door, but doors are usually stop unless rules change. 

This is tricky. Let's think about the latest observation. The key is now 1 step left and 4 steps up. The door is 4 steps up. So the door is directly above the key? Not sure. 

The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. The ball (which is win) is there. But to get there, I have to go through walls. 

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to the ball's position. But the ball is part of the active rule ""ball is win"", so maybe moving the 'win' text block next to the ball would make it redundant. 

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects include a ball at 3 steps left and 4 steps up. The 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. So the ball is separate from the 'win' rule. To make the ball the win object, it's already the case because of the rule. So maybe the goal is to reach the ball's position. 

But the path to the ball is blocked by walls. Let's check the path. From the player's position, moving up 4 steps left would reach the key. Then from there, moving up to the ball. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps up. So maybe need to go around. 

Alternatively, use the 'is' blocks to create a new rule that allows passage. For example, making ""wall is stop"" redundant by moving the 'stop' rule somewhere else. 

The 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But moving the 'stop' rule requires that it's not itself stopped. Since it's part of a wall's property, maybe walls are still stop even if the 'stop' rule is moved. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest valid action is to move left towards the key, even if blocked, but the walls are there. So perhaps the correct action is to move up to avoid the wall and then left. 

Wait, the player's position isn't given, but the objects are relative. Let's assume the player is at the origin (0,0). Then:

- Key is at (-1,4)
- Door is at (0,4)
- Wall at (1,4), (3,4), etc.
- 'is' at (5,4)
- 'win' at (6,4)
- 'baba' rule at (-4,-3)
- 'you' rule at (-2,-2)

So the player is somewhere between these points. To reach the key at (-1,4), the player needs to move left 1 and up 4. But the path is blocked by walls at (1,4) and (3,4). So moving up first might help. 

If the player moves up to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), then up to (-1,4), that might work. But need to check if there are walls in between. 

Looking at the walls: 

- At (3,4) which is right side up 4.
- At (1,4), (3,4), etc. 

So moving left from the player's position (assuming they are at (0,0)):

- Move up to (0,1)
- Move left to (-1,1)
- Move up to (-1,2)
- Move up to (-1,3)
- Move up to (-1,4) to get the key.

But need to check if any steps are blocked. Between (0,1) and (-1,1), is there a wall? The walls are at (1,4), (3,4), etc., so probably not. 

Once the key is picked up, the player can go to the door. But the door's position is at (0,4), which is directly above the key. However, the door might be a 'stop' object. 

Alternatively, with the key, move to the door and use the key to open it. But in Baba Is You, using a key usually involves pushing it into a door, which might require specific rules. 

Alternatively, after getting the key, redefine the rules to make Baba able to move through walls. For example, making ""wall is not stop"" by moving the 'stop' rule away. 

The 'stop' rule is at (0,3) according to the observation (rule `stop` 3 step up). If I can move that 'stop' rule elsewhere, then walls wouldn't block movement. 

To do that, find the 'stop' rule and move it. The 'stop' rule is at (0,3) (3 steps up). To move it, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. 

Assuming the player is at (-1,4) after getting the key, they need to move down to (0,3) to reach the 'stop' rule. But the path might be clear. 

Once the 'stop' rule is moved, walls no longer block, making it easier to reach the ball. 

But this requires multiple steps: get the key, move to 'stop' rule, move it away, then go to the ball. 

However, the current observation shows the key is at 1 step left and 4 steps up. So the player needs to navigate there. 

Given the time constraints and previous failed actions, perhaps the best immediate action is to move left towards the key, even if blocked, but considering the walls. 

Alternatively, move up to avoid the wall and then left. For example:

1. Move up once to get past the wall at (1,4).
2. Then move left to reach the key.

But without knowing the exact player position, it's hard to be precise. 

Another angle: The 'baba' rule is at (-4,-3). If the player can move that 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win', creating ""baba is win"", then touching Baba (the player) would win. To do that, the player needs to move the 'is' block from (5,4) to between (-4,-3) and (6,4). That seems impossible due to distance and walls. 

Given all this, the most feasible action is to move left towards the key, assuming that path is possible. So the action would be ""left"".

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you,"" which means that if I can get to the ball, I win. But looking at the objects on the map, the key is somewhere above, and there's a door blocking the path down. Let me parse the current observation again.

The key is 4 steps up. The door is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. There's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. The rules ""is,"" ""win,"" and other related text blocks are positioned to the right. The ball is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up, and the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a rule ""baba"" 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"" rules.

Since I'm controlled by ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped by a ""stop"" rule. The walls are marked as ""wall,"" which might be stoppable. The door is a rule ""door"" at 5 steps to the right and 2 step up, but I need to check if it's movable. The key is at 4 steps up, but there's a door blocking the path down. Wait, the key's position is 4 step up, same as the door. So maybe I need to move the door out of the way to get to the key.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""door"" rule at 5 steps to the right and 2 step up. To move the door, I need to either push it or rewrite the rules. But the door is a stoppable object unless I change its property. Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""door"" rule to something else. For example, if I can move the ""is"" text block next to ""door"" and ""stop"" or another property, I could reassign what door does.

Wait, the current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you."" The other rules are ""wall is wall,"" ""stop is stop,"" ""door is door,"" etc. So the door's behavior is fixed as a stop. To get past the door, I need to make it not a stop. Maybe if I can change the ""door is door"" rule to ""door is you"" or something else. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to ""door"" and another property.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another `win` at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move the `is` next to `door` and change its property, perhaps to `win` or `you`. But how do I move the `is`? Since I'm Baba, and assuming I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. The key is 4 steps up from there. The door is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So the path to the key is blocked by the door. To get past the door, I need to either move the door or change its rule.

The ""door"" rule is at 5 steps to the right and 2 step up. If I can move that rule next to a different property, like replacing ""stop"" with another property. For example, if the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" changing it to ""door is win"" would make the door a win condition, but that's probably not helpful. Alternatively, changing it to ""door is you"" would let me walk through it.

To do that, I need to move the `is` text block that's associated with the door. The current `is` for door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 step up. There's another `is` at 1 step to the left (maybe part of ""baba is you""). Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you,"" which are likely formed by other `is` text blocks.

The key is at 4 steps up, but the door is blocking the path. Maybe I should first go get the key, but I can't get past the door. Alternatively, maybe I can use the key on the door? But keys usually open doors, but in Baba Is You, that might depend on rules. If there's a ""key is door"" rule, then the key would open the door. But currently, the rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you,"" and other rules like ""door is door.""

Wait, there's a rule `key` at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. And the `key` object is at 4 steps up. Maybe I need to move the key to the door to unlock it. But how? If I can move the key object towards the door. The key is 4 steps up from Baba's position. The door is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, so the key is directly above the door? If so, maybe pushing the key down towards the door. But the key is at 4 steps up, and the door is also at 4 steps up but 1 step to the right. So the key is above the door? If I can move the key down one step, it might align with the door.

But the key's current position is 4 steps up. To move it down, I need to be able to push it. Since the key isn't a stop unless defined otherwise. The walls are stops, but the key isn't. So if I move towards the key, maybe I can push it down. Let's check the positions.

Baba's position is at the rule `baba` which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. The key is 4 steps up from Baba. So to reach the key, I need to move up 4 steps. But the path is blocked by the door at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So unless I can move the door, I can't get to the key.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the ball, which is a win condition. The ball is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right and down. But there are walls at 4 steps to the right and various positions. The rule `win` is at 9 steps to the right and 1 step up, so the ball being win means if I reach the ball, I win.

But how to get past the walls? The walls are stops, so I can't push them. Unless I can change their rule. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop. The rule ""wall is wall"" is at 4 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that `is` text block next to ""wall"" and another property, like ""you"" or ""push,"" maybe I can change the wall's behavior.

But this seems complicated. Let me think step by step.

1. Current active rules: ball is win, baba is you.
2. Need to reach the ball (which is a win object) to win.
3. The ball is at 7 right, 1 up. The path might be blocked by walls and the door.
4. The door is at 1 right, 4 up. It's a stop, so can't pass through.
5. To get past the door, need to either move it or change its rule.
6. The door's rule is ""door is door"" at 5 right, 2 up.
7. If I can change that rule to something else, like ""door is you,"" then the door becomes passable.
8. To do that, I need to move the `is` text block next to ""door"" and a new property.
9. There's an `is` at 5 right, 1 up. Maybe moving that `is` to connect door with a different property.
10. Alternatively, use another `is` rule. There's an `is` at 1 left (part of ""baba is you"").
11. The player (Baba) is at 1 left, 2 down. So from there, need to move to the `is` at 5 right, 1 up to modify the door's rule.
12. The distance is quite far. Maybe the player needs to move rightward towards the `is` block.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to push the door by pushing the `is` rule that defines it. If the `is` block is movable, then moving it would change where the rule applies.

But I'm not sure about the exact layout. Let me try to visualize the map again based on the latest observation:

- The key is 1 step to the left and 4 step up from Baba.
- The door is 1 step to the right and 4 step up.
- The `is` rules for door are at 5 right, 2 up.
- The `win` rule is at 9 right, 1 up, and the ball is at 7 right, 1 up.

If I can change the door's rule to, say, ""door is key,"" but that doesn't help. Alternatively, ""door is you"" so I can walk through it.

To change the door's rule, I need to move the `is` next to door and a new property. The `is` at 5 right, 1 up is close to the door's rule at 5 right, 2 up. Maybe moving that `is` down to connect with door and a new property.

For example, if I move the `is` at 5 right, 1 up to be between door (which is at 5 right, 2 up) and, say, ""you"" which is at 2 right, 2 down. Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. That's quite far.

Alternatively, there's a ""you"" rule at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down, but that's also far.

Alternatively, maybe use the ""win"" rule. If I can make door a win, then stepping on it would win, but that's not ideal.

Alternatively, make the door a pushable object. But ""push"" isn't a current rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move the key to the door to unlock it, but I don't see a rule that allows keys to open doors unless specified. Since ""key is key"" by default, unless there's a ""key is door"" rule, which there isn't.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the ball, which is a win, even if blocked by walls. But the walls are stops, so I can't pass through them. Unless I can change the wall's rule to not be a stop.

The ""wall is wall"" rule is at 5 left, 3 up. If I can move that `is` to connect wall with a different property, like ""you"" or ""push,"" then the wall becomes passable.

To do that, I need to move the `is` at 5 left, 3 up next to another property. For example, moving it next to ""stop"" so that ""wall is stop"" becomes ""wall is [another property].""

But the player is at 1 left, 2 down. The `is` at 5 left, 3 up is quite far. Moving right and up to reach it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules for ""baba"" to become something else. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe changing ""baba"" to ""win"" so that Baba itself is the win condition. But that would require changing the ""baba is you"" rule to ""baba is win.""

The ""you"" rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The ""is"" for ""baba is you"" is at 3 left, 3 down. If I can move that `is` to connect ""baba"" with ""win"" instead of ""you,"" then stepping on Baba would make you win. But that requires manipulating that specific `is` rule.

This is quite complex. Considering the time I've spent and the previous attempts where moving left or right didn't work, perhaps the correct action now is to move towards the `is` rule that defines the door's properties to change it. Since the latest observation shows the door at 1 right, 4 up, and the `is` for door at 5 right, 2 up, maybe moving down towards that `is` block to reassign the door's property.

But how to get there? The player is at 1 left, 2 down. To reach the `is` at 5 right, 2 up, the player needs to move right 6 steps and up 4 steps. That's a long way, but possible with multiple moves. However, the previous actions of moving left or right didn't lead to a solution, so maybe the correct action now is to move right to get closer to the relevant `is` blocks.

Alternatively, since the key is now at 4 steps up (closer to the player's position), maybe moving up towards the key, but the door is in the way. If I can push the door by moving it, but doors are likely stops unless specified. Alternatively, if I can change the door's rule to ""door is you,"" then I can walk through it.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, I'll try to move right to reach the `is` block that defines the door's property. So the chosen action is ""right.""

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to reach the ball since it's set as ""win"". But right now, I'm probably controlled by Baba because ""baba is you"". The key is somewhere to the left and up, but there's a door blocking the path. The door is likely a stop or wall unless rules say otherwise. Active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"".

Looking at the objects, the rule `is` is positioned at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps up. The `win` rule is at 8 steps right, 4 up. The `ball` is at 6 steps right, 1 step up. The `key` is at 8 steps right. There's a `baba` rule at 2 steps left, 2 steps down, and another `is` and `you` there. 

I need to get to the ball, which is the win condition. But the path might be blocked by walls or stop rules. Let's see the positions. If I'm positioned near the `baba` rule, maybe I can move around. The `is` and `you` rules at the bottom might be important. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to change properties. For example, if I can make a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""door is not stop"", that could help. 

The `rule 'is'` is at 7 right, 4 up. If I can move that close to the `ball` or `win` rule, I could create a new rule. But I need to check if I can move the `is` text block. Since `is` is a rule, I assume it's movable unless there's a stop rule. Looking at the map, the walls are at various positions, but the `is` rule is near the right edge. Maybe moving left or up is possible. 

Alternatively, if I can push the `ball` to the `win` position, but I don't think objects can move on their own. I need to move the `ball` by pushing it if it's not stopped. The `ball` is at 6 right, 1 up. To get there, I might need to navigate around walls. The walls are at 3 right, 4 up and decreasing steps down. There's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. So moving right from my current position (assuming I'm near the `baba` rule) might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the `key` first to get it and unlock the door. The `key` is at 8 right, which is to the right of the current `win` rule. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it on the door. But the door is at 4 up, which is in the upper part. The door's rule is at 7 right, 2 up. If I can change the door's property from `stop` to something else, like `push` or remove the `stop` rule, that would help. 

Looking at the active rules, there's a `stop` rule at 3 step up. Maybe I can move that `stop` rule away or replace it. To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to the `stop` rule and then create a new rule. For example, moving `is` to where `stop` is and then making ""stop is nothing"" or similar. 

But first, I need to figure out where I am. The observation lists objects relative to me, but the exact position isn't clear. The `rule 'baba'` is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I'm standing on that, maybe I can move. Let's assume I'm near the `baba` rule. To reach the `is` rule at 7 right, 4 up, I need to move right and up. But there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. So maybe I can't go that way directly. 

Alternatively, moving down to the `you` rule at 2 steps down. If I can change the `you` rule to something else, maybe become the key or ball. But I'm already ""baba is you"", so maybe I can make ""baba is win"" by placing the `is` next to `baba` and `win`. The `win` rule is at 8 right, 4 up. The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. So moving diagonally up and right? But movement is step by step. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the `ball` to the `win` position. The `ball` is at 6 right, 1 up. The `win` is at 8 right, 4 up. To get the ball there, I might need to push it right and up. But the path is blocked by walls and other rules. Maybe I can move the `win` rule closer to the `ball`. The `win` rule is at 8 right, 4 up. If I can move it left to 7 right, then align it with the `ball` at 6 right, but that might not be possible. 

Another angle: the `key` is at 8 right, which is where the `win` rule is. Maybe getting the key and using it on the door. The door is at 4 up, but its rule is at 7 right, 2 up. If I can change the door's property from `stop` to `pass`, then I can go through. To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to `door` and `pass`, but I don't have a `pass` rule. Alternatively, remove the `stop` rule by moving it away. 

The `stop` rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that `stop` rule away, the door would no longer be stopped. To move the `stop` rule, I need to move the `is` rule next to it and then create a new rule. For example, move `is` to where `stop` is and then make ""stop is nothing"". 

So the plan could be: move towards the `is` rule at 7 right, 4 up, then move it to the `stop` rule's position (3 step up) and create ""stop is nothing"". Then the door becomes passable. Once the door isn't stopped, go through it to reach the ball. 

Alternatively, since the ball is the win condition, maybe just reach it directly. But obstacles are in the way. Let's check the path from where I am (near `baba` at 2 left, 2 down) to the `ball` at 6 right, 1 up. 

Moving right from 2 left would get to center. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. So maybe can't go straight right. Need to navigate around. Maybe up first, then right. From 2 left, 2 down: move up to 2 left, 1 down. Then right to 1 left, 1 down. But then walls at 3 right, 1 up. Hmm, this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, focus on rearranging the rules. The key is at 8 right, which is where the `win` rule is. If I can get the key and use it, but I don't know how the key is used in rules. Maybe ""key is unlock"" or something. But there's no such rule active. 

Another thought: the `rule 'is'` is a movable object. If I can move it next to the `baba` and `win` texts, I can make ""baba is win"". The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The `win` rule is at 8 right, 4 up. So moving the `is` rule from 7 right, 4 up to somewhere between them. Let's see, the `is` is currently at 7 right, 4 up. To get to the `baba` at 2 left (which is 2 steps left from my current position?), maybe move left and down. 

Wait, the exact positions are relative. Let's assume I'm at the position of the `baba` entity. The `baba` rule is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down from wherever I am. This is getting confusing without a map grid. 

Alternatively, prioritize moving the `is` rule to link `baba` with `win`. If I can place `is` between `baba` and `win`, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition, allowing me to touch the ball without needing to move it. 

The `baba` rule is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down. The `win` rule is at 6 steps to the right and 4 step up. The `is` rule is at 5 steps to the right and 4 step up. So to move the `is` to connect `baba` and `win`, I need to move it left and down. 

If I move left from the `is` position (5 right, 4 up) to 4 right, 4 up (closer to `win` at 6 right). Then down to 4 right, 3 up. Then left to 3 right, 3 up, etc., until positioning `is` between `baba` and `win`. 

But this requires navigating around walls. The wall at 3 right, 4 up is in the way. Maybe move down first. From `is` at 5 right, 4 up: move down to 5 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 3 right, 3 up, but I'm at 5 right, so maybe clear. Then move left to 4 right, 3 up. Then up to 4 right, 4 up. Then left to 3 right, 4 up (which is a wall). Can't go there. 

This is tricky. Maybe another approach. Since the `ball` is the win, and I'm Baba, maybe I just need to reach the `ball` object. The `ball` is at 6 right, 1 up. The path might be blocked by walls and rules. Let's see the objects around there. 

At 6 right, 1 up: there's the `ball` and the `is` rule at 7 right, 1 up. To get to 6 right, 1 up, I need to move right from my current position. If I'm near the `baba` rule at 2 left, 2 down, moving right would be towards the center. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. So maybe I can't go straight right. 

Alternatively, move up first. From 2 left, 2 down: up to 2 left, 1 down. Then right to 1 left, 1 down. Then up to 1 left, 0 down (assuming down is negative). Then right to 0 left, 0 down, which is center. Then right to 1 right, 0 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up, which is not in the way here. 

This is getting too vague without knowing the exact grid. Maybe the best action is to move towards the `is` rule to manipulate the rules. For example, move right to get closer to the `is` at 5 right, 4 up. Then, once next to it, move it to link `baba` and `win`. 

But how to do that in steps. Let's say I'm currently at the position of the `baba` entity. To move right towards the `is` rule at 5 right, 4 up. So from `baba` at 4 left, 3 down, moving right would decrease the left steps. So moving right once would be 3 left, 3 down. Then again to 2 left, 3 down. Continue until reaching 5 right? No, that's conflicting. Maybe the coordinates are relative. 

Alternatively, focus on the `is` rule at 7 right, 4 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since `is` is a rule, it's likely movable unless there's a stop. The `stop` rule is at 3 step up, which is below the `is`. So moving the `is` rule up or left might be possible. 

If I can move the `is` rule to the position between `baba` and `win`, then create ""baba is win"". The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The `win` rule is at 8 right, 4 up. So the `is` needs to be placed such that it forms the link. For example, if `is` is at 4 right, 3 up, between `baba` (2 left, 2 down) and `win` (8 right, 4 up), but that's a stretch. 

This is really challenging without a visual map. Maybe the immediate action is to move right towards the `is` rule to get closer and then manipulate it. So the chosen action would be to move right.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is currently a ball. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means whatever I control (Baba) can interact with the ball as if it's the win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 2 steps to the left and 4 steps up. Then a door at 1 step left and 4 steps up. There are several walls and rules scattered around. The 'is' rules are important because I might need to rearrange them to change the rules.

First, I need to figure out how to reach the ball. The door blocks the path directly to the ball, which is up at 4 steps up. But the door is there, and there's a key. Wait, keys usually open doors. The key is at 2 left and 4 up. If I can get to the key, then move it to the door to unlock it. But how do I move the key?

Since Baba is You, I can move around unless there's a STOP rule. Looking at the rules, there's a 'stop' rule at 1 left and 3 up. So any object with 'stop' property is immovable. The walls are also there, but since I'm Baba, maybe I can push them if they're not stopped. Wait, the rules don't mention pushing, but in Baba Is You, you can move objects that aren't stopped. So maybe I can move the walls if they're not stopped. Let me check the walls' positions.

There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 step up. That's near the door. The door is at 1 left and 4 up. So maybe the wall is blocking the door. But the door is a rule 'door' at 5 steps right and 2 step up. Wait, the door's position might be different. Let me parse the objects again.

Key is 2 left, 4 up. Door is 1 left, 4 up. Wall is 2 right, 4 up. So the door is at 1 left, same level as the key but one step left. The key is two steps left from the player's position? Wait, the player's position isn't explicitly mentioned here. Maybe the 'rule baba' is somewhere. Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'baba' at 4 step left and 3 steps down. So the player (Baba) is at that position.

So the player is at 4 left, 3 down. The key is 2 left, 4 up. So from Baba's position, to get to the key, I need to move left twice and up once. But there's a wall at 1 right and 4 up. Wait, Baba is at 4 left, 3 down. So moving left from there would be towards negative steps. Maybe the map is laid out with coordinates where up and down change the y-axis, left and right the x-axis.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are relative. Let me visualize the map. The player (Baba's rule) is at 4 left, 3 down. The key is 2 step to the left and 4 up from the player's position. So from Baba's location, moving left two steps and up four steps lands at the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 4 up from the player. Wait, that's in the opposite direction. So maybe the walls are blocking other paths.

The door is at 1 left and 4 up from the player. So the door is one step left and four up. To reach the door, I need to move left once and up four steps. But the door is likely closed, so I need the key. The key is two steps left and four up. So the path to the key is left two, up four. But there's a wall at 1 right and 4 up. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the coordinates are absolute. Let me try to sketch a grid.

Assuming Baba is at position (0,0). Then:

- The key is at (-2, 4).
- The door is at (-1, 4).
- The wall at (2,4) is to the right of Baba.
- The 'rule is' at (5,4) is far to the right.
- The 'win' rule is at (6,4).
- Lower area: the 'rule baba' is at (-4, -3).
- The 'you' rule is at (-2, -2).

So the player (Baba) is at (-4, -3). The key is at (-2,4). To get there, need to move right two steps (from -4 to -2 on x-axis) and up four steps (from -3 to 4 on y-axis). But along the way, are there walls blocking?

Looking at the objects:

At (2,4): wall.

At (3,3): wall.

At (4,2): wall.

At (5,2): rule door.

At (1,1): wall.

At (6,1): rule ball.

At (7,1): rule is, win.

At (2,-1): wall.

At (-4,-2): rule baba, is, you.

So moving from (-4,-3) to (-2,4):

First, move up from -3 to 4: that's four steps up. But moving up from (-4,-3) to (-4,1), then right to (-3,1), (-2,1), then up to (-2,4). But along the way, at (-4,4), there's a wall at (2,4), which is far to the right. Wait, maybe the walls are at different positions. Let me check again:

The walls listed are:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up: that's (1,4).

- wall 3 step up: at (3,4).

- wall 2 step up: at (2,3).

- wall 1 step up: at (1,2).

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: (2,3).

- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2).

- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up: (3,3).

So the path from (-4,-3) to (-2,4):

First, move up to (-4,1), then right to (-3,1), (-2,1). From (-2,1), move up to (-2,2), (-2,3), (-2,4). But at (-2,4), there's the key. But along the way, from (-2,3) to (-2,4), is there a wall? At (-2,4), the key is present, no wall. So that path seems possible.

But wait, the door is at (-1,4), which is one step right from the key. So after getting the key, move right to (-1,4) (door) and use the key to open it. Then go through the door to the ball at (6,1), since the 'win' rule is at (6,1), and the ball is also there.

But how to move the key to the door? Because the key is at (-2,4), the door is at (-1,4). So the key is adjacent to the door. To unlock the door, I need to be next to the door with the key. But since I'm Baba, I can pick up the key and move it. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects that aren't stopped. The key isn't stopped, so I can move it.

So steps could be:

1. Move from (-4,-3) to (-2,4) to get the key.

2. Move the key to the door at (-1,4).

3. Stand next to the door with the key to unlock it.

4. Open the door and go through to (6,1) where the ball (win) is.

But how exactly to move the key. Let's think step by step.

First, navigate to the key. From Baba's position (-4,-3):

- Move up once to (-4,-2).

- Up again to (-4,-1).

- Up again to (-4,0).

- Up again to (-4,1).

- Now move right to (-3,1).

- Right again to (-2,1).

- Up to (-2,2).

- Up to (-2,3).

- Up to (-2,4), which is the key's position.

Now, pick up the key. Since I'm Baba, I can move the key by pushing it. From (-2,4), the key is there. To move it to the door at (-1,4), I need to move right. So:

- Move right from (-2,4) to (-1,4), which is the door's position. Now the key is on the door. In Baba Is You, placing a key on a door unlocks it. So now the door is unlocked.

Then, move through the door. From (-1,4), move down to (-1,3), etc., towards the ball. The ball is at (6,1), so need to navigate there. But there are walls along the way. For example, at (2,4) is a wall, but we've passed that. The path from (-1,4) down to (6,1) would require moving down four steps to ( -1,0 ), then right to (0,0), (1,0), etc., but there are walls at (1,4), (2,3), etc. Maybe need to go around.

Alternatively, since the 'win' rule is at (6,1) and the ball is there, once the door is open, moving through it would allow access to that area. But I need to figure out the exact path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since 'ball is win', if I can turn myself into the ball, then wherever I go would be a win. But to do that, I need to create a rule like 'baba is ball' by moving the 'is' text next to 'baba' and 'ball'.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule baba' at (-4,-2), a 'rule is' at (-3,-2), and a 'rule you' at (-2,-2). Also, there's a 'rule ball' at (4,1) and 'rule win' at (6,1).

If I can move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'ball', then I can change the rule to 'baba is ball', making me a ball, and then any ball would be me, and since 'ball is win', touching a ball (myself) would win.

So the steps for this approach:

1. Move to the 'rule baba' at (-4,-2), 'rule is' at (-3,-2), and 'rule ball' at (4,1).

2. Rearrange the 'is' to connect 'baba' and 'ball', making 'baba is ball'.

But how to get the 'is' rule there. The 'is' rules are scattered: at (5,4), (6,1), (7,1), (1,1), (4,-1), etc.

From the current position after getting the key, which is at (-2,4), I need to navigate to the area where 'baba', 'is', and 'ball' are. The 'baba' rule is at (-4,-2), 'ball' rule is at (4,1). The 'is' rules are at (5,4), (6,1), etc. So this might be a longer path.

Alternatively, maybe after unlocking the door and reaching the ball area, I can take that path. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the current active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. So as Baba, I can touch the ball to win. But the ball is at (6,1), which is behind the door. So I need to unlock the door by getting the key.

So the priority is to get the key, move it to the door, unlock it, then go through.

To get the key, navigate from Baba's position to (-2,4). Then move the key to (-1,4). Then enter the door.

Once inside, move to (6,1) where the ball is. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, at (2,4) is a wall, but we're coming from the left. From (-1,4), moving down to ( -1,3 ), ( -1,2 ), ( -1,1 ), ( -1,0 ), (-1,-1 ). Then move right to (0,-1), (1,-1), but there's a wall at (2,-1). So need to go around.

Alternatively, from (-1,4), move down to (-1,3), then right to (0,3), (1,3), but there's a wall at (2,3). So can't go that way. Maybe go down to ( -1,0 ), right to (0,0), (1,0), but wall at (2,0)? Not sure. This might be complicated.

Alternatively, once the door is unlocked, maybe the path is clear. Let's assume that after unlocking the door, moving through it to the right leads to the ball. But I need to confirm the positions.

The 'win' rule and 'ball' are at (6,1). So from the door at (-1,4), moving down to (-1,0), then right to (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), but there's a wall at (3,0)? Not sure. Maybe need to find another route.

Alternatively, since I have the key, maybe I can push walls if they're not stopped. The walls have 'stop' properties? Let's check. The 'stop' rule is at (1 left, 3 up), which is (-1,3). So any object with 'stop' is immovable. So walls at (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), etc., are not stopped, so I can push them.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the simpler solution is to rearrange the rules to make Baba the win object.

To do that, I need to create a rule 'baba is win'. The current rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. If I can change 'ball is win' to 'baba is win', then touching Baba would win. Or create 'baba is win' directly.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule win' at (6,1). To make 'baba is win', I need to move 'is' between 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at (-4,-2), and the 'win' rule is at (6,1). The 'is' rules are at various places, like (5,4), (6,1), (7,1), etc.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the area where 'baba', 'is', and 'win' are located.

2. Rearrange the 'is' to connect 'baba' and 'win', making 'baba is win'.

To do this, from the current position after obtaining the key (-2,4), need to navigate to (-4,-2) where 'baba' is, then get an 'is' rule and place it between 'baba' and 'win'.

The 'is' rules are available at (5,4), (6,1), (7,1), etc. So from (-2,4), move down to ( -2,3 ), ( -2,2 ), ( -2,1 ), ( -2,0 ), ( -2,-1 ), ( -2,-2 ). But at ( -2,-2 ), there's a wall. So maybe can't go that way. Alternatively, move left to (-3,4), then down to (-3,3), etc., but not sure.

Alternatively, move right to (-1,4), then down to (-1,3), (-1,2), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), then left to (-2,-1), which is a wall. Hmm.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the immediate way is to get the key, unlock the door, and then reach the ball. Let's focus on that.

So, after getting the key at (-2,4), move right to the door at (-1,4). Now the door is unlocked. Move through the door. From (-1,4), move down to (-1,3), (-1,2), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1). Then move right to (0,-1), (1,-1), but there's a wall at (2,-1). So can't go that way. Maybe move down further to (-1,-2), then right to (0,-2), (1,-2), but not sure about walls there.

Alternatively, from the door at (-1,4), move down to ( -1,1 ), then right to (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). At (2,1), there's a wall. So can't go right. Maybe move up again?

This is tricky. Maybe there's a different path. Let's think about the 'win' rule at (6,1) and the ball there. If I can push the 'win' rule to be next to the ball, but that's not necessary because 'ball is win' is already a rule.

Alternatively, since I have the key, maybe I can use it to move other objects. But the key is just a key, not a pushable object unless there's a rule allowing it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the key can be moved if it's not stopped. So once I have the key, I can carry it and move it around. So after placing the key on the door to unlock it, I can move it elsewhere if needed.

But the main issue is navigating from the door to the ball. Let's assume that after unlocking the door, moving right from (-1,4) through the door leads to a corridor where the ball is at (6,1). But there are walls along the way. For example, at (2,4) is a wall, but we're coming from the left. From (-1,4) moving right through the door, the path would be clear until (6,1).

Alternatively, maybe the door leads directly to the ball area. Once inside, move right along the bottom row (y=1) from (-1,1) to (6,1). But there's a wall at (2,1), so need to go around. Maybe up to (2,2), then","

Let's see. The goal is to reach the ball because it's defined as ""win"". But how?

First, check the active rules. ""ball is win"" means touching the ball wins. And ""baba is you"" means I'm controlling Baba. So I need to move Baba to the ball.

Looking at the objects, the ball is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls and doors in the way. Let me map out the positions.

The key is nearby, but I might need it to open a door. The door is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps up, but currently, there's a rule ""door"" at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, doors are usually stop unless their rule changes. Since the default is ""door is stop"", I can't go through them unless I change the rule.

Hmm, the rule `is` is present. Maybe I can move that ""is"" text block to change a rule. For example, if I can make ""door is not stop"" or ""baba is door"", then I could pass through. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 6 steps to the right and 4 step up. Also, there's a rule `win` and `wall` nearby. The key is at 7 steps to the right. Maybe I should go get the key first to see if it opens a door, but I don't know which door.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a rule `is` near the door's rule to modify it. Let's see. The door's rule is at 6 steps to the right and 2 step up. If I can move the `is` from (6 right,4 up) to near the door's rule, then I could create a new rule like ""door is key"" or something. Wait, but I need to have the subject and property nearby.

Wait, the current rules are ""ball is win"", ""baba is you"". To change ""door"" from stop to something else, I need to create a new rule ""door is [something]"". To do that, I need to pick up the ""door"" text block and the ""is"" text block, then place them together with a new property.

But the ""is"" text block is at 6 steps right,4 up. The ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right,2 up. So if I can move down from the ""is"" block to the ""door"" block, maybe I can create a new rule. Let's check movement.

Assuming I'm currently at Baba's position, which is at 5 step left and 2 steps down. Let me confirm Baba's location from the observation. The objects list includes ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So Baba is at (4 left, 2 down). The ""you"" rule is at 2 step left and 2 steps down, which makes sense because ""baba is you"".

So my current position is 4 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule I want is at 6 right,4 up. That's quite far. To get there, I need to move right multiple times and up. But there are walls in the way. Let's check the map.

Looking at the walls: wall 1 step right and 4 up, wall 3 step left and 3 up, etc. The path might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules instead of moving through walls.

Another approach: Since the key is at 7 steps right, maybe obtaining the key allows access to a door. But which door? The door is at 1 left,4 up. There's also a rule `door` at 6 right,2 up. If I can make that door not a stop, I could pass through.

To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is key"" or ""door is win"", but how? I need to move the ""is"" text block next to the ""door"" rule and the desired property.

The ""win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up. If I could make ""door is win"", then touching the door would win, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, ""door is you"" would let me push through it, but I need to be ""you"", which I already am.

Wait, ""baba is you"" means I'm you. So if I can make ""door is you"", then I can push through. But the default is ""door is stop"", so unless I change that rule.

So the plan is: gather the necessary text blocks (""door"", ""is"", and ""you"") and create a new rule ""door is you"". Then I can go through the door.

Where are the ""you"" and ""door"" text blocks? The ""you"" rule is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. The ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right and 2 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up.

Let me see the positions:

- ""you"" rule: 2 left, 2 down (Baba's position is 4 left, 2 down, so this is two steps left from Baba)
- ""door"" rule: 6 right, 2 up (from Baba's position, that's 10 steps right and 4 up)
- ""is"" rule: 6 right, 4 up (from Baba's position, 10 steps right and 6 up)

This seems too far. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's another ""is"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. That's closer.

So ""is"" at 1 left,1 up. The ""door"" rule is at 6 right,2 up. The ""you"" rule is at 2 left,2 down.

If I can move the ""is"" from 1 left,1 up to near the ""door"" rule at 6 right,2 up, but that's still a long way. Maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules step by step.

Alternatively, focus on getting to the ball. The ball is at 5 right,1 up. From Baba's position at 4 left,2 down, moving right 9 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, wall at 3 step right and 4 up, which is along the way if I go up first.

Perhaps a better path: Move right to avoid walls. Let's see. If I go right from 4 left to 0 left, then up. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe need to find another route.

Alternatively, use the key. The key is at 7 right. If I can get the key, maybe it opens a door. But which door? The door at 1 left,4 up or the one at 6 right,2 up.

If I go to the key at 7 right, I need to move right from 4 left (which is 4 steps right from zero) to 7 right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. So path might be blocked.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the key isn't necessary right now. Let's focus on modifying the rules.

The ""is"" text block at 1 left,1 up is closer. If I can pick that up and move it near the ""door"" rule to create a new rule.

But to move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. Baba is at 4 left,2 down. The ""is"" block is at 1 left,1 up. So from Baba's position, move left 3 steps and up 1 step to reach the ""is"" block. But are there any walls in the way?

Looking at the walls: There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, but that's not on this path. The path to 1 left,1 up would be left three steps from 4 left to 1 left, then up one step to 1 up. Are there walls there?

Checking the objects: The walls are at various positions, but I don't see a wall blocking that path. So possible to move there.

Once I have the ""is"" block, I can move it to near the ""door"" rule at 6 right,2 up. But that's a long way. Alternatively, create a rule near the existing ""door"" rule.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 6 right,2 up. If I can place ""door"" + ""is"" + ""you"" nearby, then ""door is you"" would make the door passable.

But where is the ""you"" rule? It's at 2 left,2 down. So from the ""is"" block at 1 left,1 up, move left to 2 left (passing through open spaces), then down to 2 down, then right to 6 right (but that's a long way), then up to 2 up. This seems impractical.

Alternatively, maybe use the existing ""you"" rule at 2 left,2 down. If I can move ""door"", ""is"", and ""you"" together.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to push the ""win"" rule to reach the ball. But ""win"" is at 7 right,4 up. Not sure.

Alternatively, since the ball is the win condition, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to be under the ball. But the ball is a static object; you can't move it. Only text blocks can be moved.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 6 right,4 up. The ball is at 5 right,1 up. If I can make the ball the win by moving the ""win"" rule onto the ball, but the ball is an object, not a text block. So maybe not.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""ball is win"", but that's already the case. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe I need to push through a door. The door at 6 right,2 up. If I can make it not a stop. To do that, create ""door is key"" or something. But where's the key? It's at 7 right. So maybe get the key first.

To get the key at 7 right, I need to move right from 4 left (which is 4 steps right from zero) to 7 right. But there's a wall at 3 step right and 4 up. So path might be blocked.

Alternatively, find another way around. Maybe go up to 4 up, then right around the wall. The wall at 2 left,3 up. If I move up to 4 up, then right past the wall.

Wait, Baba's position is 4 left,2 down. Let's map this step by step.

Current position: 4 left, 2 down.

Goal: Get to the ball at 5 right,1 up.

Possible path:

1. Move up from 2 down to 1 down, then 1 up, 2 up, 3 up, 4 up. But there's a wall at 2 left,3 up. So can't go straight up.

Alternative route: Move right to avoid walls. Move right to 3 left, then up.

But how?

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the answer is to move right towards the ball, but considering the walls.

Alternatively, since the previous actions were left, right, etc., maybe the correct action is to move right to reach the ""is"" rule and then create a new rule.

But given the time I've spent, the best possible action now is to move right towards the ""is"" rule at 6 right,4 up. But from current position, that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, move up to reach lower rows.

Wait, the ball is at 1 up. Maybe move up to 1 up first. From 2 down, move up to 1 down, then 1 up. But is that possible?

Looking at the map, the wall at 1 step right and 4 up isn't in the way here. So maybe:

Action: up

But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking. The observation shows walls at certain positions, but not necessarily in that path.

Alternatively, the correct action is to move right to get closer to the key or rules. Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the right move is to go right to grab the ""is"" rule and then create a new rule.

I need to figure out the correct action here in Baba Is You. Let me start by understanding the current situation based on the observation provided.

Looking at the active rules, there's ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means if I can turn into the ball, then I would be the win condition, right? Or maybe since ball is already win, perhaps getting to the ball would make me win? Wait, the goal is usually to reach the win object, but since ball is win, maybe I just need to touch the ball. But the user also mentioned that sometimes you can change what counts as a win. 

Now, looking at the objects on the map. The key is 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up. The door is 2 steps left and 4 up. There are walls blocking some paths. There's a rule 'is' at 5 steps right and 4 up, and 'win' at 6 steps right. Also, there's a rule 'ball' at 4 steps right and 1 up. 

The player is currently at the position of rule 'baba' which is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So, my current position is where the 'baba' text block is. The goal is to reach the 'win' object, which is the ball in this case. But how do I get there?

The walls are positioned such that moving directly right might be blocked by walls. Let me check the map layout more carefully. 

Looking at the vertical columns:

- In the 4 steps up row: key is left, door is left, wall is right, then 'is' rule, 'win' rule.
- At 3 steps up: walls left and right.
- At 2 steps up: door rule on the right.
- At 1 step up: wall right, then 'ball' rule, 'is', 'win' rules.
- At ground level (0 steps up): wall right, key at 6 steps right.
- Down one step: wall right, and then the 'baba' rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from here.

Hmm. So, the player is at the 'baba' rule block located 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the bottom right corner? Not sure about the exact coordinates, but the movement is relative.

The main obstacles here are the walls that are labeled as 'stop' or 'wall'. Since I'm Baba and the rules are ""baba is you"", I can move through any objects unless they are 'stop' or have other restrictive properties. Wait, but the walls are defined as 'wall', which might be a stop property. Let me check the active rules. There's a rule 'wall' at 4 steps left and 3 step up, and another 'stop' rule at 2 steps left and 3 step up. So, walls are probably 'stop' meaning they block movement. 

To get to the 'win' which is the ball, I need to navigate around the walls. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. But between me (at baba's position) and the ball, there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So moving right directly might hit that wall. 

Looking at the rules: there are multiple 'is' rules. Maybe I can manipulate the rules to change properties. For example, if I can move the 'win' rule to be under 'baba', then I could become the win condition. Alternatively, change 'ball' to be 'you' so that touching the ball makes me you, but since I'm already Baba and 'baba is you', that might not help. 

Wait, the active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. So if I can make 'baba' be 'win', then I would win just by existing. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule next to 'baba'. The current 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe moving the 'is' rule to create a new 'baba is win' rule. 

But how do I move the rules? I need to move the 'is' text block and attach it to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that 'is' down to connect with 'baba' below, perhaps creating 'baba is win'. But to move the 'is' rule, I have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that brings it next to 'baba' and 'win'. 

Alternatively, there's another 'is' rule at 1 step left and 1 step up, and another at 5 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe using those. 

The current position of the player (Baba) is at the 'baba' rule block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the bottom right corner. The 'win' rule is 6 steps right and 4 step up. That's a long way. Maybe moving in a different direction. 

Looking at the objects again: there's a key at 3 steps left and 4 step up. Maybe picking up the key helps, but I don't know if keys are used here. 

Another approach: since the ball is the win, maybe I can push the ball towards me. But to push, the ball would need to be not 'stop'. However, the ball's rule is 'ball is win', which doesn't make it stop. So if I can push the ball, but I need to check if there's a way to move it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can change the 'ball' rule to something else. For example, if I can make 'ball' be 'you', then touching it would make me you, but I'm already you. Hmm. 

Wait, the active rules are 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. If I can make 'baba' be 'win', then I would automatically win. To do that, I need to create a rule 'baba is win'. The existing 'is' rules are at various positions. The closest 'is' to Baba is at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down (rule 'is' at 3 step left and 2 steps down). If I can move that 'is' next to Baba and the 'win' rule, that would work. 

But how to get there? The player is at the 'baba' rule block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The 'is' rule is 3 steps left and 2 steps down, which is one step to the left of Baba's current position. So if I move left from my current position, I can reach that 'is' rule. Then, move it downwards to connect with the 'win' rule? 

Wait, the 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far. Alternatively, there's a 'win' rule at 6 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe that's closer. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is a distraction. Let me focus on the immediate area. The player is at the 'baba' rule block. To the left is another 'is' rule. If I move left to grab that 'is' rule, then I can move it somewhere else. 

But can I move the 'is' rule? Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move objects that are not 'stop'. The 'is' rule isn't 'stop', so I can move it. So the plan is: move left to the 'is' rule at 3 step left and 2 steps down, pick it up, then move it to connect with 'baba' and 'win'. 

But how to position it. The current 'baba' rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. If I move the 'is' to be adjacent to both 'baba' and 'win', that would create the new rule. But the 'win' is far away. Maybe there's a closer 'win' rule. 

Looking at the objects, there's a 'win' rule at 6 steps right and 1 step up. That's maybe reachable. So the steps could be: 

1. Move left to the 'is' rule at 3 step left and 2 steps down.
2. Move the 'is' rule down to be next to the 'baba' rule.
3. Then move the 'is' rule to the right to connect with the 'win' rule at 6 steps right and 1 step up.

But navigating around the walls. From the current position (Baba at 4L, 2D), moving left takes me to 3L, 2D, which is the 'is' rule. Then, moving that 'is' down to 3L, 3D? But there's a wall at 2 step up (maybe?). Wait, the walls are at certain positions. Let me check again. 

Walls are at:
- 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- 4 step left and 3 step up
- 2 step left and 3 step up
- 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- 4 step right and 3 step up
- etc.

So moving down from 3L, 2D would be to 3L, 3D. Is there a wall there? Not that I see. So moving the 'is' rule down to 3L, 3D. Then, move it right to 4L, 3D (adjacent to Baba's original position). Then, move it up to 4L, 4D? But the 'win' rule is at 6R,4U. This seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer 'win' rule. The 'win' at 6R and 1U is closer. So from the 'is' rule at 3L,2D, move right to 4L,2D (Baba's position), then up to 4L,1D. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So that path is blocked. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to the right past the wall. But the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up is a 'stop' rule? Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. Maybe the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up is just a regular wall (stop). So I can't push through it. 

Hmm. Maybe a different approach. Since the ball is the win, perhaps I can move to the ball's location. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. From my current position (Baba at 4L,2D), moving right would take me towards the wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. So that's blocked. 

What if I can change the 'wall' rule to something else? For example, make 'wall' be 'push' or 'you', but that requires moving the 'wall' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 4L,3U. If I can move that 'is' rule next to it, maybe I can redefine it. 

Alternatively, use the 'key' to unlock a door. The door is at 2L,4U. There's a key at 3L,4U. If I can get the key and bring it to the door, maybe the door becomes passable. But how to move the key. 

To pick up the key, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction of the key. The key is 3 steps left and 4 steps up from me. So from my current position (4L,2D), moving left 3 steps and up 4 steps would reach the key. But there are walls in the way. The path upwards would have walls at 1R,4U and others. 

This seems complicated. Maybe the key isn't necessary here. Let's go back to the initial idea of creating a 'baba is win' rule. 

The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that 'is' down to be next to 'baba' and 'win', but that's a long distance. Alternatively, use the 'is' rule at 1 step left and 1 step up. 

From my current position (4L,2D), moving left to 3L,2D (the 'is' rule), then moving that 'is' down to 3L,3D, then right to 4L,3D (adjacent to Baba), then up to 4L,4D. But the 'win' rule is at 6R,4U. So from 4L,4D, moving right 2 steps and up to reach the 'win' at 6R,4U. But there's a wall at 1R,4U. So that path is blocked. 

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to the right after placing it next to Baba. Let's say I move the 'is' from 3L,2D to 4L,2D (next to Baba), then move it up to 4L,3D, then right to 5L,3D, then up to 5L,4D, where there's an 'is' rule. Then combine them? Not sure. 

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach: since the ball is the win, and I'm Baba who is you, maybe I can just push the ball towards me. But to push, I need to be adjacent to the ball and move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. The ball is at 4R,1U. From my current position (4L,2D), the ball is to the right and above. So to push the ball left, I would need to be to the right of the ball and move left. But I'm currently to the left of the ball. 

Alternatively, move right towards the ball, but there's a wall at 1R and 1U. So that's blocked. 

Wait, the 'door' is at 2L,4U. Maybe using the door to open a path. But I don't see a rule that makes door passable unless it's changed. 

Another thought: the 'key' is at 3L,4U. If I can get the key and bring it to the door, maybe the door becomes unlockable. But again, movement is blocked by walls. 

Maybe I need to focus on moving the 'win' rule closer. The 'win' is at 6R,4U. If I can move that 'win' rule down to 6R,1U, which is another 'win' rule. But that doesn't help. 

Wait, there's a 'win' rule at 6R,1U. Maybe combining that with 'baba' by moving an 'is' next to both. The 'is' rules are at various positions. The closest 'is' to the lower 'win' is at 5R,1U. So if I can move that 'is' to be next to 'baba' and the 'win' at 6R,1U. 

From my current position (4L,2D), moving right to 5R,2D (but there's a wall at 1R and 1U, which might block this path). Alternatively, move the 'is' from 5R,1U to 4R,1U (next to 'baba' at 4L,2D? No, that's not adjacent). Hmm. 

This is really tricky. Maybe I should try moving right to see if I can reach the 'is' rule at 5R,4U. From current position (4L,2D), moving right 5 steps would get to 5R,2D. But there's a wall at 1R and 1U, which is in the way. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, move up to 4L,1D. But there's a wall at 1R and 1U, which is 1 step right and 1 step up from me. So moving up from 4L,2D to 4L,1D is possible if there's no wall. Wait, the wall at 1R and 1U is a separate wall. So from 4L,2D, moving up to 4L,1D is allowed unless there's a wall there. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1R and 1U, but that's not in my path. So moving up to 4L,1D is possible. 

At 4L,1D, what's there? The rule 'ball' is at 4R,1U. So if I move up to 4L,1D, then move right to 4R,1D, but the 'ball' rule is at 4R,1U, which is diagonally up-right from my current position. So to get to the 'ball' rule, I need to move right and up. 

But from 4L,1D, moving right to 4R,1D, then up to 4R,2D. However, there's a wall at 1R and 2U, which might block that. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move right towards the 'win' rule, but avoiding walls. Wait, the 'win' rule is at 6R,4U. From my position (4L,2D), moving right and up. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, look for a way to redefine the rules to make walls passable. For example, if I can change 'wall' to 'push' or 'you', then I can move through them. 

The 'wall' rule is at 4L,3U. If I can move an 'is' next to it and another object, like 'push', then 'wall is push' would make walls pushable. But I don't have a 'push' rule. 

Alternatively, make 'wall' be 'you', so I can walk through walls. To do that, create 'wall is you'. But I need the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 2L,2D. 

So steps could be:
1. Move to the 'you' rule at 2L,2D.
2. Grab it.
3. Move to the 'wall' rule at 4L,3U.
4. Create 'wall is you' by placing the 'is' rule next to both.

But from my current position (","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to get past this level in Baba Is You. Let me start by understanding the current setup.

The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means if I can turn into the ball, or maybe change the win condition, I could reach the ball to win. But right now, the ball is defined as the win object, so touching it should win the game. But maybe there's a wall or a stop blocking the way.

Looking at the objects on the map: The key is 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up. The door is 2 steps left and 4 up. There are several walls and rules scattered around. The rule `is` is at 5 steps right and 4 up, and `win` is at 6 right and 4 up. Down below, there's a rule for `baba` being you, along with `is` and `you` rules.

Since I'm controlled by ""baba is you"", I can move as Baba. The goal is to reach the ball, which is the win object. But the path might be blocked. Let me check the positions. The ball is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's a wall at 1 step right, so moving directly right from my current position might hit a wall. Wait, but where exactly am I located? The observation doesn't specify my position, only the positions of other objects. Hmm, maybe I need to infer my position based on the objects.

Looking at the door at 2 steps left and 4 up, and the key at 3 left and 4 up. If I'm assuming Baba's position is somewhere near the `baba` rule at 4 left and 2 steps down, maybe that's my starting point. So from there, I need to navigate to the ball.

But how to get past the walls. The walls are at 1 step right, 3 step up, etc. The `is` and `win` rules are to the right, maybe I can move those to change rules. For example, if I can move the `win` rule next to the ball, then maybe redefine something else as win. Or move the `is` rule to create a new rule like ""baba is win"", but I need to see if that's possible.

Wait, the current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can push the `win` rule (which is at 6 right, 4 up) closer to the ball, maybe I can make a new rule like ""ball is stop"" or something else. But to do that, I need to move the `win` text block. However, text blocks can only be moved if they aren't defined as stop or similar. Are any of the rules making `is` or `win` immovable? The active rules don't have anything like ""is is stop"", so `is` should be movable. The `win` rule is part of the active rule ""ball is win"", but that doesn't make `win` itself stop. So I can probably move the `win` rule.

So the plan could be: move the `win` rule to be next to the ball, then create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by combining `baba` (which is a text block at 4 left, 2 down) with `win` (now next to the ball). Then, since I'm Baba and can push text blocks, I can create ""baba is win"", making me the win condition. Then, moving to the ball would win the game.

Let me check the positions. The `win` rule is at 6 steps right and 4 up. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So to get from the `win` rule to the ball, I need to move down and left. But the path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe move the `win` rule to the ball's location by pushing it left and down. But I need to see if there's a way to navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe use the `is` rule to create a new rule. The `is` rule is at 5 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that `is` to be next to `baba` and `win`, then I could create ""baba is win"". But first, I need to get to that `is` rule. The current position of the `is` is at 5 right, 4 up. To reach it, I might need to move up and right, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. Wait, the wall is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So from my assumed position (4 left, 2 down), moving up to 4 up would be possible, but there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up. Hmm, maybe I need to find another path.

Alternatively, perhaps push the `key` to somewhere. The key is at 6 steps right. But I'm not sure if the key is needed here. The door is at 2 left, 4 up. If I had the key, I could open the door, but the door's rule is at 5 right, 2 up. The door itself is at 2 left, 4 up. So maybe the door is blocking a path upwards. But with the current rules, can I push the door? The door's rule is ""door is door"" implicitly, unless there's a rule making it stop. The active rules don't have anything against moving the door. So maybe I can push the door aside, but that would require being able to move it, which might not be possible if it's considered a stop. Wait, the active rules have ""stop"" at 2 left, 3 up. So perhaps the door is not stop, so I can move it.

But this seems complicated. Let me focus back on the win condition. The ball is the win object. If I can reach it, I win. The problem is the path to the ball is blocked by walls. Looking at the map, from the ball's position (4 right, 1 up), there's a wall at 1 right. So to get to the ball, I need to go around the wall. But where am I starting? Maybe my position is near the `baba` rule at 4 left, 2 down. So moving right towards the ball would hit the wall at 1 right. Wait, the walls are at 1 step right, 4 up, 3 step up, etc. Maybe I need to go around the wall by moving up first.

Alternatively, use the `is` rule to create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into something else, like ""wall is you"", then I could walk through walls. But that would require rearranging the rules. Let's see: the existing `wall` rule is at 4 left, 3 up. So if I can move that `wall` rule and the `is` rule together to create a new rule like ""wall is you"", then walls would be passable. But to do that, I need to push the `wall` rule and the `is` rule next to each other.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop is nothing"", but I don't have a `nothing` text block. Hmm. This is tricky.

Alternatively, since the goal is the ball, which is win, maybe I can just push the ball to the win rule? No, the ball's position is fixed; you can't push objects unless they're not stop. The ball isn't defined as stop, so maybe I can push it. Wait, the ball is the win object, but unless there's a rule saying ""ball is stop"", I can push it. So if I can push the ball towards the win rule, but the win rule is already at 6 right, 4 up. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. So maybe moving the ball down and right? But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So touching the ball wins. But the path is blocked by walls. So maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules to change the win condition to something else I can reach. For example, make ""baba is win"", then I just need to reach any safe spot, which is easier.

To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"". The components are the `baba` text block at 4 left, 2 down, the `is` rule at 5 right, 4 up, and the `win` rule at 6 right, 4 up. So I need to move the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`.

But how to get there? My current position is likely near the `baba` rule. Let's assume I'm at 4 left, 2 down. To get to the `is` rule at 5 right, 4 up, I need to move up and right. But the way might be blocked. There's a wall at 1 step right, 4 up. So moving right from my position (4 left, 2 down) to 5 right would require moving through steps. Let's see:

From 4 left, 2 down, moving up to 4 up. There's a wall at 1 step right, 4 up. So if I move right from my position, I can go to 3 left, 2 down, then 2 left, etc. But the `is` rule is at 5 right, 4 up. This seems a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move the `win` rule closer to the ball so that I can create a new rule there.

The `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. So moving the `win` rule down and left. To do that, I need to push it. Since `win` is a text block, and unless there's a rule making it stop, I can push it. The active rules don't have ""win is stop"", so I can move it. So if I move the `win` rule left to 5 right, 4 up (which is where the `is` rule is), then I can create a new rule by combining `baba` (at 4 left, 2 down) with `win` (now at 5 right, 4 up). But I need to get the `is` rule between them.

Alternatively, move the `is` rule to be between `baba` and `win`. Let's think step by step.

1. Move the `is` rule from 5 right, 4 up to a position next to `baba` (4 left, 2 down). But the distance is quite far. Maybe move the `is` rule down and left.

But the `is` rule is at 5 right, 4 up. To get to `baba` at 4 left, 2 down, I need to move left and down. However, there are walls in the way. For example, at 1 step right, 4 up is a wall. So moving left from the `is` rule's position (5 right, 4 up) would go to 4 right, 4 up. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, at 4 step to the left and 3 step up is a `wall`, but that's at 4 left, 3 up. So from 5 right, 4 up, moving left to 4 right, 4 up is possible unless there's a wall. The walls listed are at specific positions, so maybe it's clear.

Assuming I can move the `is` rule left to 4 right, 4 up, then down to 4 right, 3 up, then to 4 right, 2 up, and finally to 4 right, 2 down, which is next to the `baba` rule. But I need to check if any walls are in the path. The wall at 1 step right, 4 up is not in the way. The wall at 4 left, 3 up is on the opposite side. So maybe possible.

Once the `is` rule is next to `baba` and `win`, I can create ""baba is win"". Then, since I'm Baba, I would be the win condition, allowing me to touch anything (or just stand there) to win. But I need to reach the `win` rule or the `is` rule to create the new rule.

Alternatively, if I can move the `win` rule closer to the ball, then maybe the ball becomes the win by default, but I still need to reach it.

This is getting quite complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to push the `win` rule next to the ball and create a new rule. Let's see:

The `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. The ball is at 4 right, 1 up. To move the `win` rule down to the ball's level, I need to push it left and down. Each move would require moving the `win` rule one step at a time. Since it's a text block, and there's no rule saying it's stop, I can push it.

So, starting at 6 right, 4 up, move left to 5 right, 4 up (there's an `is` rule there; can I push past it? Probably not, unless I move the `is` rule out of the way first). Alternatively, move the `win` rule down to 6 right, 3 up, then left to 5 right, 3 up, etc., but this might take several steps.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""baba is win"" by rearranging the existing rules. Let's say I move the `is` rule to be between `baba` and `win`. The `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. The `is` rule is at 5 right, 4 up. So if I can move the `is` rule down to 5 right, 3 up, then to 5 right, 2 up, then to 5 right, 1 up, and finally to 5 right, 2 down, placing it next to the `baba` rule at 4 left, 2 down. But this requires navigating around walls.

This is quite involved. Given the time constraints, maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the `is` rule to start rearranging the rules. For example, from the assumed position (4 left, 2 down), move right towards the `is` rule at 5 right, 4 up. But the path might require going up and right.

Alternatively, check if there's a way to push the `key` or other objects to create a path. The key is at 6 right, which is probably on the other side of the walls. Not sure.

Another angle: since the ball is win, and it's positioned at 4 right, 1 up, maybe there's a way to push the ball past the walls. The ball isn't stop, so I can push it. If I can get next to the ball and push it towards the win rule, but the win rule is already at 6 right, 4 up. Maybe pushing the ball towards the win rule would make touching it win, but the ball's position is fixed unless I can move it.

Wait, no, the ball's position is where the object is placed. Unless I can push the ball object. Since the ball isn't defined as stop, I can push it. So if I move to the ball's location and push it, maybe I can move it closer to the win rule. But the ball is at 4 right, 1 up. To push it right, there's a wall at 1 step right. So pushing it right is blocked. Pushing it up from 1 up to 2 up, but is there a wall there? There's a wall at 1 step right, 2 step up. So pushing the ball up from 4 right, 1 up to 4 right, 2 up would hit the wall at 1 right, 2 up. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, push the ball left. From 4 right, 1 up, pushing left to 3 right, 1 up. Is that possible? If there's no wall there, then yes. Looking at the objects, at 1 step right and 1 step up is a wall. So 3 right, 1 up might be clear. If I can push the ball left, then maybe create a path around the wall.

But this requires being adjacent to the ball and having a clear path. If I can move to the ball's position and push it left, that might open up a path. Let's see:

Assuming I'm at 4 left, 2 down. To reach the ball at 4 right, 1 up, I need to move right and up. There's a wall at 1 step right, 4 up, but that's higher up. Moving from 4 left, 2 down to 4 right, 1 up would require moving right 8 steps and up 3 steps. That's a long way, blocked by several walls.

This seems too tedious. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to get the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`. Let's try to move the `is` rule down and left.

The `is` rule is at 5 right, 4 up. Move down to 5 right, 3 up. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, at 2 left, 3 step up is a `stop` rule, but that's at 2 left, 3 up. So 5 right, 3 up is clear. Move `is` down to 5 right, 3 up. Then left to 4 right, 3 up. Check for walls: at 4 step left and 3 step up is a `wall`, which is at 4 left, 3 up. So from 4 right, 3 up, moving left would be to 3 right, 3 up, which is clear. Continue moving left to 2 right, 3 up, then 1 right, 3 up, then to 0 right, 3 up. But the `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down. This path might not lead directly.

Alternatively, move the `is` rule down to 5 right, 2 up. Then left to 4 right, 2 up. Then down to 4 right, 1 up, placing it next to the `win` rule at 4 right, 1 up. Wait, the `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. No, the `","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to reach the ball because it's defined as win. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move around.

Looking at the objects, the ball is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up from where I am. But there are walls blocking the path. The wall to the right at 1 step right and 4 steps up might be a problem. Wait, maybe I can move the 'is' rule or 'win' rule to change something. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. If I can move that, maybe I can change a rule.

Wait, the key is 3 steps left and 4 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock the door? The door is 2 steps left and 4 steps up. But the door is probably a 'stop' because of the 'rule stop' somewhere. So to open the door, maybe I need to change the 'stop' property. But how?

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the text blocks to make 'baba' win instead of the ball. For example, if I can create a rule like ""baba is win"", then I can just move to Baba himself, which is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. But how to do that?

The 'is' rule is movable if it's not defined as 'stop'. Looking at the active rules, there's no rule saying 'is' is stop, so maybe I can pick up the 'is' rule and move it. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. If I move it next to 'baba' and 'win', I can create ""baba is win"". But how to get there?

First, I need to navigate past the walls. The walls at 1 step right and 4 steps up are blocking the direct path to the 'is' rule. Maybe I can move left or down to find a path. Let's see the current position of the player. The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, which I assume is my position because ""baba is you"". So I'm at that location.

To reach the 'is' rule at 5 steps right and 4 steps up, I need to go right and up, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps up. So maybe I need to move around the wall. Let's check the map layout.

From my position (4 left, 2 down), moving up 4 steps would take me to the 'is' rule's x-coordinate (5 right), but the wall at 1 right and 4 up is in the way. So perhaps I can move right first to get past the wall. Wait, the wall is at 1 step right and 4 up. If I move right once, am I stepping into that wall? Because the wall is at 1 step right from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative. This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize.

Assuming my position is (0,0). The 'wall' is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, so (1,4). The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 up, which is (5,4). There's a wall at (1,4), so moving right from (0,0) to (1,4) would hit the wall. So I can't go directly right and up. Maybe I need to go around. Let's check other directions.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'door' at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe that's a movable object. If I can move the door, maybe it opens a path. But the door is a 'stop' because of the 'rule stop' at 2 left and 3 up. So unless I change that rule, the door is stoppable.

Alternatively, maybe move the 'win' rule from (6,4) to somewhere else. But 'win' is currently defining the ball as win. If I can move 'win' to point to Baba, that would be better. But how?

Wait, the key is at 3 left and 4 up. If I can get the key, maybe it unlocks something. The door is at 2 left and 4 up. If I have the key, moving the door (which is a stop) might allow passage. But doors are usually opened with keys, but in Baba Is You, you have to move the door object and the key together, or maybe the key is used to modify the door's rule. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule like ""key is you"" so I can pick up the key. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'key' and 'you'. The 'you' rule is at 2 left and 2 down. The key is at 3 left and 4 up. So moving 'is' to connect them might be possible.

But first, I need to reach those positions. Let's think step by step.

Current position: rule `baba` at 4 left, 2 down.

Active rules: ball is win, baba is you.

Goal: reach the ball (4 right, 1 up) but blocked by walls.

Alternative goal: change the rule to make baba the win, so I can just stand on myself.

To do that, need to create ""baba is win"" rule. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'.

The 'win' rule is at 6 right, 1 up. The 'baba' text block is at 4 left, 2 down. The 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up.

So the path from my position to the 'is' rule is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From (4 left, 2 down), moving up would go towards (4 left, 1 down), then (4 left, 0 down), etc. But the walls at 1 step right and 4 up are probably in a different coordinate system. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the map's grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the 'is' rule to link 'baba' and 'win'. Let's see where those are located.

'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up. 'baba' text block is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up.

So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the 'is' rule between 'baba' and 'win'. But the positions are quite apart. Maybe I can move the 'is' rule down to the area of 'baba' and 'win'.

Alternatively, maybe move the 'win' rule closer to 'baba'. But 'win' is at (6,4), and 'baba' is at (4,-2). Not sure.

Alternatively, pick up the 'is' rule and move it towards 'baba' and 'win'. Let's say I move right to get to the 'is' rule. But the path is blocked.

Wait, the 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. From my position (4 left, 2 down), moving right 5 steps and up 4 steps would reach it. But along the way, there's a wall at 1 right and 4 up. So maybe I need to detour.

Maybe move up first to avoid the wall. From (4,-2), move up to (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). But at (1,4), there's a wall. So if I'm moving right while going up, maybe I can go around.

Alternatively, move left to get past the wall. From (4,-2), move left to (3,-2), then up. But not sure if that helps.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: since the ball is win, but it's behind walls, perhaps I need to move the walls. But walls are defined by the 'wall' rule at 4 left, 3 up. If I can change that rule, maybe turn it into something else. For example, create ""wall is push"" so I can move the walls. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'wall' and 'push'.

The 'push' rule isn't present, so I need to create it. But how? The available text blocks include 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'key', 'baba', 'you'.

Alternatively, create ""wall is stop"" which it already is, but that doesn't help. Maybe create ""you is push"" so I can push walls. But I need to be 'you' to push. Since I'm already 'baba is you', I am you. So if I can make myself push, maybe I can move the walls.

Wait, 'you' is a property. So if I can make 'you' equal to 'push', then I can push objects. So create ""you is push"". To do that, move the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'push'. The 'you' rule is at 2 left and 2 down. The 'push' text block isn't present, but maybe it's somewhere else. Wait, the available objects don't list 'push', so I need to create it by moving existing rules.

Alternatively, use existing rules. For example, if there's a 'stop' rule, maybe rearrange it. But not sure.

Alternatively, since I'm 'you', maybe I can move the walls by stepping on them? But walls are 'stop', meaning I can't move through them. Unless I have a 'push' property.

This is tricky. Let's recap:

- Goal: reach the ball (which is win) but blocked by walls.
- Alternative: change the rule to make Baba win, so I don't need to move to the ball.

To make Baba win, need ""baba is win"". To create this rule, need to move the 'is' rule between 'baba' and 'win'.

Current positions:

- 'baba' text block: 4 steps left, 2 steps down.
- 'win' rule: 6 steps right, 1 step up.
- 'is' rule: 5 steps right, 4 steps up.

So the 'is' rule is quite far from both 'baba' and 'win'. To move it, I need to navigate to its location, but the path is blocked by walls.

Let me try to map out the positions more clearly. Assuming my starting position is at (0,0):

- 'baba' is at (-4, -2).
- 'is' rule is at (5,4).
- 'win' rule is at (6,1).
- Wall at (1,4).

So to get to the 'is' rule at (5,4), I need to go from (0,0) to (5,4). But there's a wall at (1,4), which is on the way if I go straight right and up.

Possible path:

1. Move up to (0,4), but that's blocked by the wall at (1,4). So can't go straight up.
2. Move right to (5,0), then up to (5,4). But is there a wall in that path?
   - From (0,0) to (5,0): no walls mentioned in the current observation except those listed.
   - Then up to (5,4): but the 'is' rule is at (5,4), so maybe that's possible.

Wait, the walls listed are:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up: (1,4)
- wall 4 step up: (any x,4)? The observation says ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"", ""wall 2 steps to the right and 4 step up"", etc. So multiple walls at y=4.

So moving up to y=4 would hit those walls. So the path right then up is blocked.

Alternative path: move left to avoid the wall. From (0,0), move left to (-1,0), then up. But the 'baba' text block is at (-4,-2), so moving left might take me away.

Alternatively, move down first, then right and up. From (0,0) to (0,-1), then right to (5,-1), then up to (5,4). But are there walls in that path?

The observation lists walls at various positions, but not along that path. So maybe possible.

But I need to check the objects listed. The walls are at specific positions:

- Wall 1 step right and 4 up: (1,4)
- Wall 4 steps up: probably (any x,4) but the observation says ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"", ""wall 2 steps to the right and 4 step up"", etc., so multiple walls at y=4.

Other walls:

- At 4 step left and 3 step up: (-4,3)
- Stop at 2 step left and 3 step up: (-2,3)
- Wall 1 right and 3 up: (1,3)
- Wall 1 right and 2 up: (1,2)
- Etc.

So moving from (0,0) down to (0,-1), right to (5,-1), then up to (5,4) would avoid the walls at y>=2.

Once at (5,4), which is the 'is' rule's position, I can pick it up and move it to link 'baba' and 'win'.

But how to get from (5,4) to 'baba' at (-4,-2) or 'win' at (6,1)?

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to near 'win' first. 'win' is at (6,1). So from (5,4), move right to (6,4), then down to (6,1). But there's a wall at (6,4)? Not sure. The observation lists a rule `win` at (6,4), so that's a text block, not a wall. So maybe possible.

Once the 'is' rule is at (6,4) next to 'win', then move it down to (6,1) to create ""win is win""? No, that doesn't help. Wait, need to create ""baba is win"".

So perhaps move the 'is' rule from (5,4) to between 'baba' (-4,-2) and 'win' (6,1). That would require moving it left and down, which might be possible if there are no walls in the way.

But the distance is quite large. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, use the 'key' to unlock something. The key is at 3 left and 4 up (-3,4). If I can get the key and move the 'door' which is at 1 left and 4 up (-1,4). The door is a 'stop', but if I have the key, maybe I can move the door. In Baba Is You, usually you push doors with the key in hand, but here it's about moving text blocks.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""key is push"", then use the key to push the door. But that requires rearranging text blocks.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the 'is' rule to create ""baba is win"".

To do that, I need to be near both 'baba' and 'is', then move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win'.

But given the current positions, it's a long movement. Perhaps the best action is to move right towards the 'is' rule, step by step, avoiding walls.

From the initial position (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then (2,0), etc., until reaching (5,4). But need to check for walls.

Looking at the walls listed, the only walls at y=0 are not mentioned, so maybe possible. Then once at (5,4), pick up the 'is' rule and move it down to (5,1), then right to (6,1) to place it next to 'win', and left to (4,-2) to place it next to 'baba'.

But this requires multiple steps and might not be feasible in one action. Since each action is a single step, I need to choose the next immediate action.

Alternatively, the best immediate action is to move right towards the 'is' rule, as that seems like the key to changing the rules. So the next action should be 'right' to get closer to the 'is' rule at (5,4).

I need to figure out how to get to the win object, which is a ball. Right now, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means I need to reach the ball to win, and since Baba is You, I can move like Baba.

Looking at the map, the key is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up from my current position. There's a door 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up. There are walls blocking the way. The 'is' rule is 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that 'is' rule to change a rule?

Wait, the rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". The 'is' rule is a keyword to create new rules. If I can move the 'is' rule near other text blocks, I can create new rules. But first, I need to navigate through the walls. The walls are at positions that I can't pass through unless they're not 'stop'. The 'stop' property makes things immovable. Let me check the objects again.

The wall at 4 steps up is a 'wall' object. The rule 'wall' is at 5 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe I can use that? Not sure. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps up. That might be important. The door is a 'door' object, which I assume can be opened if I have a key. The key is far left, 4 steps left and 4 steps up. But there's a wall at 4 steps up, so maybe I need to move that wall or change its property.

Let me think about movement. The key is to the left, but there's a wall blocking the path. Maybe I need to move the 'wall' rule to change its property. For example, if I can make 'wall' into 'stop' or something else. But how?

The 'is' rule is 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I move that 'is' to the 'wall' rule (5 steps left and 3 steps up), I could create a new rule like 'wall is [something]'. But I need to reach that 'is' rule first. The problem is that moving right 4 steps from my current position would take me to the 'is' rule. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the current position, perhaps I'm centered. To the right is the 'is' rule at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. Wait, no, the 'is' is 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the key's position? Maybe I need to adjust my understanding of the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at a certain position, and other objects are relative to that. The observation lists the key's position as 3 steps left and 4 steps up from the player's current position. Similarly, other objects are relative. So, the player is somewhere, and all objects are positioned relative to the player.

In this case, to reach the key, which is 3 steps left and 4 steps up, I might need to move left and up. But there's a wall 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So moving up directly would hit a wall. Hmm. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make that wall passable.

The 'is' rule is 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I can move that 'is' rule next to the wall's rule (4 steps left and 3 steps up), perhaps I can create a new rule like 'wall is stop', which it already is, but maybe changing it. Wait, the existing rules are 'wall is stop' at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can make that 'wall' not 'stop', then the wall would be passable.

To do that, I need to use the 'is' rule to redefine 'wall'. For example, if I move 'is' next to 'wall' and another property, like 'key', then 'wall is key' would make walls act like keys. But how to get there?

Alternatively, the 'baba is you' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule involving 'baba'. For example, making 'baba' a 'win' or 'key'.

But the immediate goal is to get to the ball (win). The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. There's a rule 'ball is win' at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So the ball is right there, one step to the right. But wait, the ball's position is 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move right once, I reach the ball. But is there a wall in between?

Looking at the objects on the map: wall 1 step to the right. So if I'm one step left of the ball, there's a wall at 1 step right. That would block my path. So I can't go straight right to the ball because of the wall. Therefore, I need to remove that wall or change its property.

The wall at 1 step right is a 'wall' object. Its rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can change that rule, maybe to 'wall is stop' is already there. Wait, the rule 'wall' is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which defines that wall has the property 'stop'. So the wall is immovable. To get past it, I need to either move the wall (which I can't because it's stop) or change its property.

So perhaps I need to use the 'is' rule to redefine 'wall' into something else. For example, if I can make 'wall' a 'key' or 'win', but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, create a rule that makes 'stop' not apply to walls.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. The rule 'stop' means that objects with the 'stop' property cannot be moved. So if I can remove the 'stop' property from walls, they would become movable. How?

If I can create a new rule like 'stop is nothing', that would remove the stop property. But to do that, I need to have the 'is' rule next to 'stop' and 'nothing'. But 'nothing' isn't an existing object here. This might be tricky.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the existing rules. The 'is' rule is 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If I move that 'is' rule to the 'stop' rule's position, I could create a new rule. For example, moving 'is' next to 'stop' and 'key' might make 'stop is key', which would make stop act like a key, allowing me to move it. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Since Baba is You, I can move any object that is not 'stop'. The wall is 'stop', so I can't move it. But maybe I can change the 'wall' rule to not be 'stop'. The 'wall' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that 'wall' rule next to another property, perhaps 'ball' or 'key', to redefine it.

For example, if I move the 'wall' rule to be next to 'key', creating 'wall is key', then walls would function like keys. But how to do that? I need to use the 'is' rule to connect them. So first, move the 'is' rule to the position of 'wall' (4 steps left and 3 steps up), then place it next to 'key' (which is at 5 steps right). But the distance might be an issue. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. To move it to the 'wall' rule's position, I need to move left 4 steps and down 1 step. But that might be possible.

Alternatively, focus on the ball. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. There's a rule 'ball is win' at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So the ball is adjacent to its own rule. If I can move the ball to the 'win' rule's position, but the ball is a 'win' already, so maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, the goal is to be on the ball, since 'ball is win' and 'baba is you'. So being on the ball makes me win. So I need to reach the ball's position.

But the path is blocked by a wall at 1 step right. So how to get past it? Maybe push the wall? But since it's 'stop', I can't. Unless I change its property.

Alternatively, use another rule to override 'stop'. For example, create a rule that says 'stop is you', which would make stop behave like you, but I don't know if that's possible.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to redefine 'stop'. For example, if I can make 'stop is nothing', then stops would have no effect. But I need to have the 'is' rule next to 'stop' and 'nothing'. 'Nothing' isn't an object here, so maybe that's not feasible.

Another idea: The key is 4 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to open the door. The door is 3 steps left and 4 steps up. But there's a wall at 4 steps up, blocking the path to the key. So first, I need to reach the key, but the wall is in the way. To get the key, I might need to remove the wall or change its property.

Alternatively, use the 'is' rule to create a new rule that allows movement through walls. For example, 'wall is you', making walls behave like you, so you can walk through them. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'wall' and 'you'.

The 'you' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The 'wall' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. It's a bit far, but maybe possible to move the 'is' rule left and down to connect to 'wall' and 'you'.

Alternatively, focus on the immediate goal. The ball is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. There's a rule 'ball is win' at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move right once, I reach the ball. But there's a wall at 1 step right. How to bypass that?

Wait, the wall at 1 step right is a 'wall' object with the 'stop' property. If I can create a rule that makes 'stop' not apply to me, maybe. Since I'm Baba, and 'baba is you', maybe create a rule like 'you is not stop'. But how?

To create such a rule, I need the 'is' rule next to 'you' and 'not stop'. 'Not stop' isn't a standard property, but maybe possible. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. If I can move it to be next to 'you' (2 steps left and 2 steps down) and 'stop', then create 'you is not stop'. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, create a rule that changes 'stop' to another property. For example, 'stop is win', making stops act like win, so you can walk on them. But again, the positioning is tricky.

Maybe the easiest way is to move the 'is' rule to the 'wall' rule's position and redefine 'wall' as something else. For example, move 'is' to be next to 'wall' and 'key', making 'wall is key'. Then walls would be movable like keys. But how to do that?

The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. To get to the 'wall' rule at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, I need to move left 9 steps and down 1 step. That's a long way, and the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule to the 'stop' rule's position (2 steps left and 3 steps up) and create a new rule. For example, 'stop is nothing', removing the stop property. But again, positioning is an issue.

Alternatively, focus on moving towards the ball despite the wall. Since the wall is 'stop', and I can't push it, maybe I need to find another way around. Looking at the map, there's a door at 3 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can open the door with the key, that might lead to a path to the ball. But the key is 4 steps left and 4 steps up, behind a wall.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to create a new rule that allows passing through walls. For example, 'wall is you', making walls part of you, so you can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'wall' and 'you'.

The 'wall' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. The 'you' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. It's quite far, but maybe possible to move the 'is' rule left and down.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' rule to create a new rule nearby. For example, move the 'is' rule to the position of 'ball' (4 steps right and 1 step up) and create 'ball is you', but 'ball is win' is already active, and 'baba is you', so that might not help.

Wait, the ball is already the win object. If I can get to the ball, I win. The problem is the wall blocking the path. Since I can't move the wall, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the wall passable.

Another idea: The 'key' is 4 steps left and 4 steps up. If I can reach the key, maybe I can use it to open a door elsewhere, but the door is at 3 steps left and 4 steps up, which is adjacent to the key. So if I have the key, I can open the door, which might provide a path to the ball.

But to get the key, I need to move left 4 steps from my current position, but there's a wall at 4 steps up. Wait, no, the key's position is 4 steps left and 4 steps up from the player. So moving left 4 steps and up 4 steps would reach the key. But the path is blocked by a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps up. That's in the way when moving up.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap:

- Goal: Reach the ball (which is win) at 4 right, 1 up.
- Blocked by a wall at 1 right.
- Wall is 'stop', so can't push.
- Need to change wall's property or find a way around.

Possible solutions:

1. Redefine 'stop' to remove its effect on walls.
2. Make walls passable by changing their rule.
3. Use the key to open a door that provides a new path.
4. Change the ball's rule to be at a reachable position.

Let's try solution 1: Redefine 'stop'.

The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can create a rule like 'stop is win', then stops would be win, allowing passage. To do that, move 'is' next to 'stop' and 'win'.

The 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. To reach 'stop' at 2 left, 3 up, need to move left 7 steps and down 1 step. That's a long move, but possible. However, the path might be blocked by other objects.

Alternatively, move 'is' to the 'win' rule's position (5 right, 4 up) and adjacent to 'stop'. But not sure.

Alternatively, solution 3: Use the key to open the door.

The door is at 3 left, 4 up. The key is at 4 left, 4 up. So to get the key, move left 4 steps and up 4 steps. But the wall at 4 up is in the way. Wait, the wall at 4 up is 1 step right from the player's position? Or is it relative?

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving the 'is' rule to the 'wall' rule's position to change its property.

The 'wall' rule is at 4 left, 3 up. The 'is' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. To move 'is' to 'wall', need to move left 9 steps and down 1 step. That's a lot, but perhaps possible by moving left repeatedly.

Alternatively, the current position of the player is such that moving right once would take them to the 'is' rule. Once there, they can use it to create a new rule.

Wait, the 'is' rule is 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. If the player is at position (0,0), then the 'is' is at (4,4). The ball is at (4,1). The wall is at (1,4). So to get from (0,0) to (4,1), need to go right 4 and down 3. But there's a wall at (1,4), which is on the way up.

Hmm. Maybe the player's current position is somewhere else. This is challenging without a visual map.

Alternatively, think of the grid as the player's position is in the center, and objects are placed relative to them. To move right towards the 'is' rule at 4 right,4 up, then down to the ball.

But the wall at 1 right is blocking the direct path. So perhaps move around the wall by going down, then right, then up.

For example, move down to avoid the wall, then right, then up. But the map's layout isn't clear.

Alternatively, use the 'is' rule to create a new rule that allows movement through walls. For example, create 'wall is you', making walls part of you.

To do that, move the 'is' rule next to 'wall' and 'you'. The 'wall' rule is at 4 left,3 up. The 'you' rule is at 2 left,2 down. The 'is' rule is at 5 right,4 up. It's quite far, but maybe possible to move the 'is' rule in that direction.

Alternatively, focus on the immediate goal: reach the ball. Since the ball is","

I need to figure out the correct action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let's look at the current observation again.

The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, my goal is to get to the ball since it's defined as win. But how?

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up. There's a door at 3 steps left and 4 up. Walls are blocking some paths. The ""rule is"" blocks are scattered, probably important for manipulating the game rules.

I notice that there's a ""rule win"" at 5 steps right and 4 up. Also, a ""rule ball"" at 3 steps right and 1 up. Maybe I can move these text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""key is you"", that might help.

Wait, the player (Baba) is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down, according to the last part of the observation. The rule `baba` is there with `is` and `you` rules. So, if I can move the `you` rule to Baba, that makes me the YOU, allowing me to push other objects or move through STOP properties?

But right now, ""baba is you"" is active, so I am already considered as YOU. Hmm. What's blocking the path to the ball? There are walls and possibly STOP rules. The door is at 3 left and 4 up, but the key is further left. Maybe I need the key to open the door?

The key is at 4 left, 4 up. To get there, I might need to move left or up from my current position. But the walls are at 4 up, so maybe moving up isn't possible. The rule `is` is at 4 right, 4 up. If I can move that rule near another text block, I can create a new rule.

Alternatively, if I can change ""ball is win"" to something else, but that might not help. Maybe I need to reach the ball by rearranging the rules. Let's see: the ball is at 3 right, 1 up. There's a `rule win` at 5 right, 1 up. If I can move the `win` rule to the ball's location, then the ball becomes the WIN, but it's already the WIN. So that's not necessary.

Wait, the `rule ball` is at 3 right, 1 up. If I can move that `ball` rule next to the `is` rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""something is ball"". But I'm not sure. My goal is to reach the ball, which is the WIN. So maybe I just need to get there directly.

Looking at the map layout again, from my position (Baba at 5 left, 2 down), how do I get to the ball? Let's see:

The ball is at 3 right, 1 up. From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving right once gets me to 4 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, the wall is at 1 step right and 2 steps down? Or is that another wall? Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects list:

- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `you` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down

So, from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving right would take me to 4 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged such that moving right from Baba's position is blocked. Alternatively, maybe I need to move up.

But the path up might have walls. For example, wall 4 step up. So moving up from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down) would take me to 5 left, 1 down. Then up again to 5 left, 0 down (which might be the same as 5 left, same level). But there's a wall at 4 step up. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the rules to change the behavior of walls or doors. The door is at 3 left, 4 up. If I can make the door not a STOP, then I can go through it. To do that, I might need to move the `stop` rule away from the door or replace it.

Looking at the objects, there's a `rule stop` at 3 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that `stop` rule somewhere else, the door might no longer be a STOP. But how do I move it? I need to be able to push text blocks that are not STOP.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can push objects unless they have the STOP property. The `rule stop` is a text block. If I can move it, I can then move the `door` rule or others.

But where am I located? Let me confirm Baba's position. The last part of the observation says:

Objects on the map:
... 
rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down

So Baba is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down. The player (Baba) is here, and the `is` and `you` rules are adjacent. So maybe I can move the `you` rule to make Baba have another property.

But the immediate goal is to reach the ball. The ball is at 3 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's position. Let's map the steps:

Baba's position: (5 left, 2 down)

To reach the ball at (3 right, 1 up):

- Move right twice: 5 left → 4 left → 3 left (but need to check if there are walls)
- Move up once: 2 down → 1 down

But between these steps, are there walls blocking?

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 4 step up
- wall 3 step up
- wall 2 step up
- wall 1 step up
- wall 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down

But these are general positions. Maybe the walls are in specific coordinates. For example, ""wall 4 step up"" might be at 4 steps up from Baba's position. So moving up from Baba (5 left, 2 down) to 5 left, 1 down (which is one step up) would be blocked by wall 1 step up? Wait, the walls are listed as:

- wall 4 step up
- wall 3 step up
- wall 2 step up
- wall 1 step up
- wall 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down

This might mean that in the upward direction from Baba's position (2 down), moving up 1 step would be to 1 down, which has a wall. Moving up 2 steps would be to 0 down (same level), which has a wall at 2 step up? Not sure. The description is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are placed at specific positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 4 step up"" means there's a wall 4 steps above the player's current position. So moving up 4 steps from (5 left, 2 down) would land at (5 left, 2 down -4) = (5 left, -2), but that's probably not relevant.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the text blocks. The ""rule is"" at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule, I could create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" to the right next to ""ball"", then it would become ""ball IS [something]"". But what's the purpose?

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba would win, but the goal is the ball. Hmm.

Another approach: Since the key is at 4 left, 4 up, maybe I need to get the key first to open the door. But the door is at 3 left, 4 up. If I have the key, I can unlock the door. But how do I get the key? The key is at 4 left, 4 up. From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving left 4 steps and up 2 steps would get to the key. But there might be walls in the way.

Looking at the walls again, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which is adjacent to Baba's position. So moving right from Baba's position is blocked by a wall. Therefore, moving right isn't possible. Maybe I need to move left to reach the key.

Wait, the key is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps up from Baba. So from (5 left, 2 down):

- Move left 4 steps: 5 left → 1 left
- Move up 4 steps: 2 down → -2 down (assuming up is positive direction)

But along this path, are there walls? The walls are listed at various positions, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged in a grid that I need to navigate around.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""rule is"" blocks to create a new rule that allows movement through walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into something else, like ""wall is nothing"", then walls wouldn't block me.

But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall. The ""rule stop"" is at 3 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, then perhaps the walls would no longer be STOP.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be able to push it, which requires that it's not itself a STOP. Since the ""stop"" rule is a text block, and unless there's a rule saying ""rule is stop"", it can be moved. But in the current active rules, ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"", there's no rule making text blocks or rules themselves stop.

So, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule. If I move it to a different location, then the associated wall might no longer be a STOP.

But where is the ""stop"" rule located? It's at 3 step left and 3 step up. From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving left 3 steps and up 3 steps would reach the ""stop"" rule. But that's a long way, and there might be obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule, making ""baba is [something]"". But what's the something I need?

The goal is to reach the ball. Since the ball is already the WIN, maybe I just need to get there. But how?

Another idea: Since ""baba is you"", maybe I can push other objects. For example, if I can push the key or the door. But to push, I need to be adjacent and move in a direction, and the object behind should be empty or a pushable object.

But the key is at 4 left, 4 up. From Baba's position, that's left and up. To push the key, I would need to be next to it and move in the direction away from it. But I'm not next to the key right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make ""key is you"", allowing me to control the key. Then I could move the key to open the door. But how to do that?

To make ""key is you"", I need to have a text block ""key"" and ""you"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""you"" rule is currently at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down, which is adjacent to Baba's position. The ""key"" rule is at 5 steps to the right. So from Baba's position, I need to move the ""you"" rule to the ""key"" rule and connect it with an ""is"" rule.

But the ""is"" rules are scattered. There's an ""is"" rule at 4 steps right and 4 steps up, and another at 2 steps to the left and 1 step up, etc.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the ball, avoiding walls by using the rules to change their properties.

Alternatively, since the ball is the WIN, maybe I can just walk towards it once the path is clear. Let's see:

From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), to reach the ball at (3 right, 1 up), the path would be:

Right twice (to 3 left), then up once. But there's a wall at 1 step up. So moving up from 2 down to 1 down is blocked. How to get around that?

Maybe if I can make the wall at 1 step up not a STOP. The ""rule stop"" is at 3 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall might no longer block.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 left, 3 up. From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving left 3 steps and up 3 steps would reach the ""stop"" rule. But that's a long way with possible walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule that I can use to create a new rule allowing movement through walls. For example, creating ""wall is push"" or something. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: The door is at 3 left, 4 up. If I can open the door, maybe I can go through it. To open the door, I might need the key. The key is at 4 left, 4 up. So the sequence would be: get the key, unlock the door, then go through to the ball.

But how to get the key? The key is 4 left and 4 up from Baba. To reach it, move left and up. But there are walls blocking. For example, the wall at 4 step up. If I can make that wall not a STOP, then I can move through.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a rule like ""wall is nothing"". But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 5 step left and 3 step up. From Baba's position, that's left and up. To move the ""is"" rule at 4 right, 4 up to near the ""wall"" rule.

This requires navigating through the map, moving the ""is"" rule towards the ""wall"" rule, then creating a new rule. But this seems complicated.

At this point, I think the most straightforward action, given the previous failures, is to keep moving right towards the ball, hoping that eventually, the path clears or I can manipulate a rule to bypass obstacles. Alternatively, move up to see if there's a clearer path.

But considering the previous attempts and the defaulting to idle, perhaps the correct action is to move right towards the ball, assuming that the path will eventually be cleared by manipulating rules. Alternatively, move up to reach the ""is"" rule and create a new rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. From Baba's position, moving right 4 steps and up 4 steps would reach there, but that's a long way. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule.

Another observation: The ""rule is"" at 4 steps right and 4 steps up is quite far. Maybe there's a way to use the existing rules to create a ""baba is win"" rule, which would make touching Baba itself a win condition. But the ball is already win, so that might not help.

Alternatively, create ""key is win"" so that grabbing the key wins. But the key is on the other side of a door.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving right again, as previous attempts to move left didn't work, and idle isn't helping. Let's choose right as the action.

Let's try to figure out what the solution here is. The active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means the goal is to reach the ball, since it's defined as win, and I'm Baba because ""baba is you"".

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up from my current position. There's a door at 4 steps left and 4 up, and a wall at 1 step left and 4 up. Then there are some rule blocks like ""is"" and ""win"" positioned to the right of the upper structures.

The key is probably needed to open the door. But how do I get to the key? The path might be blocked by walls. The wall at 1 step left and 4 up could be a problem. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass it. The ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can change a property. 

Wait, the rules that are movable are those that aren't defined as STOP or similar. The current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"", which are probably fixed. The other rules like ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"" can be moved because they aren't part of the active immutable rules. 

So, if I move the ""rule `is`"" block from 3 steps right and 4 up to somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls or the stop blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then I would become a stop, which is immovable, which is bad. Alternatively, maybe make ""key is you"", so I can pick up the key. But how to do that?

Looking at the current setup, the ""rule `key`"" is at 4 steps to the right. If I could move that ""key"" rule next to the key object, then combining them might make the key a YOU, allowing me to push it. But I need to be Baba to do that, and since ""baba is you"" is active, I can move. 

Alternatively, the ""rule `win`"" is at 4 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that to be under the ball, making ""ball is win"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe the goal is to reach the ball, but there's a wall blocking the path. The wall at 1 step left and 4 up is directly in the way. If I can change the wall's property, maybe to ""stop"", but that's already a rule. Wait, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 4 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to the wall's position, then the wall would become stop, which is immovable. Not helpful. 

Another idea: The ""door"" is at 4 steps left and 4 up. If I can get the key (which is 5 left, 4 up) first, then use the key on the door. But the door is to the right of the key. So maybe the path is key -> door -> ball. But how to get past the wall at 1 left, 4 up. 

Wait, the current position of the player (Baba) is not explicitly listed, but the rules and objects are positioned relative to something. Assuming Baba is at a starting point, perhaps the key is to the left and up, and the door is further left. To get to the key, need to move left and up, but there's a wall at 1 left,4 up. Maybe that wall is a STOP, which I can't pass through. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away from that wall, then maybe the wall isn't a stop anymore. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 4 step left and 3 step up. If I move that rule to somewhere else, perhaps the wall at 1 left,4 up would no longer be a stop. Then I could move through it. 

So the plan might be: move the ""rule `stop`"" block from (4 left,3 up) to a different position, like above the wall at (1 left,4 up). Then the wall would lose its stop property, and I could walk through it. Then go get the key, use it on the door, and reach the ball. 

But how to move the ""rule `stop`"" block? The player (Baba) needs to move to the position of the ""rule `stop`"" block, which is at 4 left and 3 up, then move it. But first, check if the path to that rule is blocked. The objects around there: wall at 3 step up, so maybe the player can move there. 

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 3 right,4 up. If I move that ""is"" rule next to the ""rule `stop`"", maybe I can create a new rule. For example, combining ""is"" with ""stop"" and ""something else"". But I'm not sure. 

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 3 step left and 2 steps down. If I can make Baba a YOU, but that's already the case since ""baba is you"" is active. 

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So Baba is the player. The goal is to reach the ball, which is win. The key is nearby. So maybe the solution is to pick up the key, unlock the door, and then get to the ball. 

To get the key, which is 5 left and 4 up. The path is blocked by a wall at 1 left,4 up. If that wall is a STOP, I can't pass. So need to remove the STOP property from that wall. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 4 left,3 up. If I can move that rule to overwrite the wall's position (1 left,4 up), making the wall no longer a stop. 

But how to move the ""rule `stop`"" block. The player needs to be adjacent to it and move it. The player's position isn't specified, but assuming they are near the lower part. Let's say the player is at the position of ""rule `baba`"" which is at 5 step left and 2 steps down. From there, need to move up and right to reach the ""rule `stop`"" at 4 left,3 up. 

The path from 5 left,2 down to 4 left,3 up: move left once, up once. But is there a wall in between? The wall at 1 left,4 up is far, but the path to 4 left,3 up: from 5 left,2 down, move left to 4 left,2 down, then up to 4 left,3 up. Are there walls there? The wall at 1 step left and 4 up is not in the way. The wall at 3 step up is at 1 left,3 up? Not sure. Maybe the path is clear. 

Once the player reaches the ""rule `stop`"" at 4 left,3 up, they can move it to the wall's position (1 left,4 up) by moving up and left. Overwriting the wall's rule would remove the STOP property. Then the player can pass through the wall at 1 left,4 up. 

After that, go get the key at 5 left,4 up, pick it up (if possible), then move to the door at 4 left,4 up, use the key to open it, and then reach the ball. 

But the key's position is 5 left,4 up, which is directly where the wall was. If the wall's STOP property is removed, the player can move through. So from the player's starting position (5 left,2 down), move left to 4 left,2 down, up to 4 left,3 up (rule `stop`), then move up to 4 left,4 up (door), but need to move the rule `stop` to 1 left,4 up. 

Wait, moving the ""rule `stop`"" from 4 left,3 up to 1 left,4 up would require moving it diagonally or in steps. Each move is one step in a direction. So from 4 left,3 up, to reach 1 left,4 up, the player needs to move left 3 times and up 1 time. But each move can only be one step. So the player would have to move left, left, left, up, up, etc., but that might take several steps. However, in the current observation, after several left and right moves, the key's position changes? Or is the key's position static?

Looking back at the observations, each time the assistant moves left or right, the key's position changes. For example, initially, the key was 4 steps left and 4 up, then after a left move, it became 3 steps left, then 2, then 1, etc. So the key is moving left each time the assistant moves left. That implies that the player's movement affects the positions of the objects? Or perhaps the key is an object that's being pushed when the player moves into it. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, when you push an object (like a key or a rock), you have to move in the direction opposite to where you want the object to go. For example, to push a key to the right, you move left, and the key moves right. 

So if the assistant keeps moving left, the key is being pushed to the right. Similarly, moving right would push the key to the left. 

In the current observation, the key is at 5 step to the left and 4 step up. The player (Baba) needs to reach the key. But the path is blocked by a wall that's a STOP. So the solution is to remove the STOP property from that wall. 

To do that, the player needs to move the ""rule `stop`"" block to overwrite the wall's rule. The ""rule `stop`"" is currently at 4 step left and 3 step up. The wall with STOP property is at 1 step left and 4 step up. 

So the player needs to move the ""rule `stop`"" block from (4L,3U) to (1L,4U). To do that, the player has to move in the direction towards that wall. 

Assuming the player's current position is near the ""rule `baba`"" block at 5L,2D, the steps would be:

1. Move left from 5L,2D to 4L,2D.
2. Move up to 4L,3D (but need to get to 4L,3U).
Wait, directions are up, down, left, right. So from 5L,2D, moving left would be 4L,2D. Moving up from there would be 4L,1D, then 4L,0D, then 4L,1U, etc. This is getting confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative to a central point, and moving up/decreases the Y-coordinate, down/increases Y, left/decreases X, right/increases X. 

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are described as steps from a reference point. For example, the key is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up from the reference point. The player's position is somewhere else. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to focus on moving the ""rule `stop`"" to the wall's position. 

The ""rule `stop`"" is at 4L,3U. The target position is 1L,4U. The difference is 3 steps left and 1 step up. So the player needs to move from 4L,3U to 1L,4U. 

To do that, the player can move left three times and up once. But each move must be one step at a time. So from 4L,3U:

- Move left to 3L,3U
- Move left to 2L,3U
- Move left to 1L,3U
- Move up to 1L,4U

Now, placing the ""rule `stop`"" at 1L,4U would overwrite any existing rule there. The wall at 1L,4U has a STOP property, so overwriting it with the ""rule `stop`"" might not change anything, but if the rule is moved there, it could redefine the property. Wait, but the wall's position is at 1L,4U, and the rule `stop` is being moved there. So if the wall was previously defined by a ""wall is stop"" rule, moving the ""rule `stop`"" there might not remove the wall's stop property. Hmm, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe the wall's existence is separate from its properties. So moving the ""rule `stop`"" to the wall's position would make that position have the stop property, but the wall is still there. So the player can't pass through. That might not help. 

Another approach: Instead of moving the ""stop"" rule, create a new rule that makes the player (Baba) not stop. For example, ""baba is not stop"". But to create that, you need to have the ""is"" rule and combine it with ""baba"", ""not"", and ""stop"". However, the game might not allow negation unless there's a ""not"" text block. 

Looking at the current objects, there's no ""not"" rule present. The available rules are ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""key"", ""baba"", ""you"". So without a ""not"" rule, it's difficult to create negation. 

Therefore, the best bet might be to remove the STOP property from the wall. To do that, move the ""rule `stop`"" away from the wall's position. For example, move it to a different spot where it doesn't affect anything. Then the wall at 1L,4U would no longer be a STOP, allowing the player to pass. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""rule `stop`"" at 4L,3U.
2. Move the ""rule `stop`"" to a different position, say, 1L,4U (the wall's spot), but that might not help. Alternatively, move it to 5L,4U (where the key is) or another spot.
3. After moving, the wall at 1L,4U loses its STOP property, and the player can pass through.

Once that's done, the player can move left and up to reach the key. 

But how to move the ""rule `stop`"" block. The player needs to be adjacent to it and push it in the desired direction. 

In the current observation, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 4L,3U. The player's position is at 5L,2D (rule `baba`). To reach 4L,3U, the player needs to move left once and up once. From 5L,2D:

- Move left to 4L,2D
- Move up to 4L,1D
- Move up to 4L,0D
- Move up to 4L,1U
- Move up to 4L,2U
- Move up to 4L,3U

Once there, the player can push the ""rule `stop`"" block. To move it left to 3L,3U, the player needs to move left, and the block moves right. Wait, in Baba Is You, to push an object, you move in the opposite direction. So to move the ""rule `stop`"" block to the left (from 4L,3U to 3L,3U), the player needs to move right. 

Yes, so if the player is at 4L,3U and wants to move the ""rule `stop`"" block to the left (3L,3U), the player should move right, causing the block to move left. 

So the sequence would be:

- From 5L,2D, move left to 4L,2D.
- Move up to 4L,3U.
- Now, push the ""rule `stop`"" block to the left by moving right. The block moves left to 3L,3U, and the player moves to 4L,3U (but now the block is at 3L,3U).

Repeat this process to move the ""rule `stop`"" block further. For example, move right again to push it to 2L,3U. Continue until it's moved away from the wall at 1L,4U. 

Once the ""rule `stop`"" is moved, the wall at 1L,4U no longer has the STOP property, so the player can pass through. 

Then, the player can move left and up to reach the key. Since each move left pushes the key right, the player needs to carefully navigate. For example, to get the key, which is at 5L,4U, the player might need to move left past the wall (now non-stop), but the key is being pushed right each time the player moves left. 

Alternatively, after removing the STOP, the player can move directly to the key's position. 

But this requires a series of precise moves. Given the previous failed attempts where the assistant kept moving left or right without achieving progress, maybe the correct action now is to move the ""rule `stop`"" block by pushing it to a different position. 

In the current observation, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 4L,3U. To move it left to 3L,3U, the player needs to be adjacent and move right. So the action would be ""right"". 

But the player's current position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the ""rule `baba`"" position at 5L,2D, moving left once gets to 4L,2D, then up to 4L,3U, then right to push the ""rule `stop`"" left. 

However, the assistant's previous actions were moving left and right without considering this, leading to defaulting to idle. So the correct action now is to move right while adjacent to the ""rule `stop`"" block to push it. 

But in the latest observation, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 4L,3U. The player needs to be at 4L,3U to push it. So the sequence of actions would be moving left and up to get there, then pushing right to move the block left. 

Since the previous actions were moving left repeatedly, maybe the player is now at a position where they can push the","

Let's see. The current rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, I need to get myself to the ball to win. But how do I move? The key is probably involved here. The key is at 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. The door is also to the left and up, but there are walls blocking the path. The active rules mention ""win"" is a ball, so if I can reach the ball, that should solve it. But how to get past the walls?

Looking at the objects, there are several ""rule is"" text blocks. The rule `is` is located 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe I can move that rule somewhere to change the game rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" and keep ""baba is you"", that might let me turn into the win condition. Wait, but ""baba is you"" means I control Baba. If I can make ""baba is win"", then since I'm Baba, I would become the win condition, allowing me to step on the ball to win.

But how to do that? The ""rule is"" is movable if it's not defined as ""stop"". The current rules don't mark ""is"" as stop, so I can move it. The key is located at 5 steps left and 4 up, but I need to get to the ""rule is"" block. Let's check the positions. The rule `is` at 3 steps right and 4 up. So from my current position (assuming I'm Baba, who is at 6 steps left and 2 steps down), moving right 4 steps and up 4 steps would reach the rule `is`. Wait, no, the position of Baba is at 6 steps left and 2 steps down. So to get to the rule `is` at 3 steps right and 4 up, I need to move right 3 steps and up 4 steps. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the walls.

Looking at the map, there are walls at various positions. For example, wall 1 step to the left and 4 up, wall 1 step left and 3 up, etc. So moving right towards the rule `is` might be possible if there's a clear path. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the key first. The key is 5 steps left and 4 up, which is in the opposite direction of the rule `is`. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""ball is win"" rule somewhere else. For example, if I move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba"", making ""baba is win"". But the ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right and 4 up. So I need to move that text block. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move objects unless they are ""stop"". The ""win"" rule isn't stop, so I can pick it up and place it next to ""baba"". The ""baba"" rule is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down. So moving the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" position and combining them into ""baba is win"".

To do that, I would need to move from my current position (6 left, 2 down) to the ""win"" rule at 5 right and 4 up. Wait, that's a long distance. Let me calculate the steps. From 6 left to 5 right would be a total of 11 steps right, and from 2 down to 4 up would be 6 steps up. That's a lot, and maybe there are walls in the way. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move the existing ""is"" rule to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps right and 4 up. If I can place it between ""baba"" and ""win"", creating ""baba is win"", that would work. So from my current position, moving right to reach the ""is"" rule. Let's see: current position is 6 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 right, 4 up. So I need to move right 3 steps and up 4 steps. Let's check if there are walls along that path.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 1 step left and 4 up, which is to the left of the ""is"" rule. Then there's a wall at 1 step left and 3 up, and so on. Moving right from my position, I'd pass through open spaces unless blocked. Let me visualize the grid. If I move right 3 steps from 6 left, I'd be at 3 left, then 2 left, then 1 left, then 0 (neutral), then 1 right, 2 right, 3 right. The ""is"" is at 3 right, 4 up. So moving right 3 steps and up 4. Along the way, are there walls? At 1 step left and 4 up is a wall, but that's to the left of the path. The path to the ""is"" rule is to the right, so maybe clear. Then, once I have the ""is"" rule, I can move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form ""baba is win"".

So the steps would be: move right towards the ""is"" rule, pick it up, then move to where ""baba"" and ""win"" are located, and place the ""is"" between them. That would create the new rule ""baba is win"", making me (as Baba) the win condition. Then I can walk over the ball to win.

But how to execute this in the given actions? The possible actions are idle, up, right, down, left. So each step is a single direction move. Let me see the positions again.

Baba's position: 6 step to the left and 2 steps down. So coordinates could be considered as (x, y), where left is negative x, right is positive x, up is positive y, down is negative y. So Baba is at (-6, -2). The ""is"" rule is at (3, 4). To get there, need to move right 9 steps (from -6 to 3) and up 6 steps (from -2 to 4). But that's a lot. Maybe there's a closer path or perhaps I need to move the ""is"" rule piece by piece.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" position. The ""win"" rule is at (5,4), and ""baba"" is at (-6, -2). Moving ""win"" to near ""baba"" would require moving it left 11 steps and down 6 steps, which seems impractical due to walls.

Another approach: since the key is nearby, maybe picking up the key first. The key is at 5 steps left and 4 up, which is (-5,4). From Baba's position (-6,-2), moving left 1 step and up 4 steps would reach the key. But there's a wall at (-1,4), so that path is blocked. Alternatively, maybe there's another route.

Wait, the key is at (-5,4). Let's see the path from (-6,-2) to (-5,4). Moving left 1 (to -5) and up 4. But between (-6,-2) and (-5,4), there's a wall at (-1,4), but that's further right. So maybe that path is blocked. Alternatively, moving up first. From (-6,-2), move up to (-6, -1), then (-6,0), (-6,1), (-6,2), (-6,3), (-6,4). But at (-6,4), there's a wall. So can't go up to (-6,4). So maybe need to move right instead.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe focusing on the ""is"" rule first. The ""is"" rule is at (3,4). To reach there, from (-6,-2), move right 3 times to get to (0, -2), then right 3 more to (3, -2). Then up 4 steps to (3,2), then up 2 more to (3,4). Along the way, check for walls. From (-6,-2) to (3,-2): moving right, are there walls? At (1,-2), (2,-2), etc., are there walls? Looking at the observation, there's a wall at (1 step right and 2 steps down) which is (1,-2). So when moving right from (-6,-2), when I reach (1,-2), there's a wall. So I can't go through there. So that path is blocked.

Alternative path: move up first. From (-6,-2) move up to (-6,-1), (-6,0), (-6,1), (-6,2), (-6,3), (-6,4). But at (-6,4), there's a wall. So stuck. Then maybe move right and up diagonally. For example, move right 1 to (-5,-2), then up to (-5,-1), etc. Let's see if there's a clear path.

From (-6,-2) move right to (-5,-2). Any walls here? The observation doesn't mention a wall at (-5,-2). Then move up to (-5,-1), (-5,0), (-5,1), (-5,2), (-5,3), (-5,4). At (-5,4) is the key, which is movable. But moving up to (-5,4) would reach the key. However, the key is at (-5,4), so moving there would pick it up. But why would I need the key? Maybe to unlock the door, but the door's position is at (-4,-4) relative? Not sure. Alternatively, moving the key somewhere else.

But the main goal is to manipulate the rules. Let's get back to the ""is"" rule. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at (-6,-2), ""win"" is at (5,4), and ""is"" is at (3,4). If I can move the ""is"" to between ""baba"" and ""win"", but that's a long distance. Alternatively, create a new rule by placing ""baba"", ""is"", ""win"" together.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"" is active, and I'm Baba, maybe I can change ""you"" to ""win"". The ""you"" rule is at (4 step to the left and 2 steps down), which is (-4,-2). If I can move the ""you"" rule to say ""win"" instead. But how?

Alternatively, take the ""win"" rule at (5,4) and move it to next to ""baba"", then place an ""is"" between them. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from (5,4) to near (-6,-2). That's a distance of 11 left and 6 down. There are walls along the way, like at (-1,4), (-1,3), etc. So it's blocked.

Hmm. Maybe the key is involved here. The key is at (-5,4). If I can pick up the key and use it to move other objects. But the key isn't a rule, so maybe it's just an object that can be moved to unlock doors. The door is at (-4,-4) relative? Not sure. The door's position is ""door 4 step up"" which might be at (0,4) assuming the current position is reference. Wait, the observation lists objects with their positions relative to something. For example, ""key 4 step to the left and 4 step up"" – so from whatever the reference point is, the key is 4 left and 4 up. But in the previous observations, Baba's position was given as ""rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down"", so perhaps the reference point is the lower-left corner of the map.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to focus on moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule. Since the ""is"" rule is at (3,4), and ""baba"" is at (-6,-2), it's a long way, but perhaps possible by moving right and up step by step, avoiding walls.

So the plan is: move right towards the ""is"" rule, avoiding walls. From (-6,-2), move right 1 to (-5,-2). Check if there's a wall. The observation shows walls at (1 step right and 2 steps down) which is (1,-2), but that's further right. So (-5,-2) should be clear. Move right again to (-4,-2). Check walls. The observation mentions a wall at (3 step up) but not here. Continue moving right until reaching (3,4). Then move up to (3,4). Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to near ""baba"" and ""win"".

Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is already at (3,4), maybe I can move it left to connect with ""baba"". But moving left from (3,4) to (-6,-2) is too far. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to the right. The ""win"" rule is at (5,4). Move it right to (6,4), then down to (6, -2) where ""baba"" is. But again, walls might block this.

Another idea: the ""stop"" rule is at (4 step to the left and 3 step up), which is (-4,3). If I can remove the ""stop"" property from something, maybe I can move walls. But ""stop"" is a property, not a rule. The rules are ""ball is win"", ""baba is you"", ""wall is stop"", etc. So ""wall is stop"" means that walls have the stop property, making them immovable. So if I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else, walls become movable. For example, if I make ""wall is push"" or remove the rule, then walls can be moved.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (6 step to the left and 3 step up), which is (-6,3). To reach there, from (-6,-2), move up to (-6,1), (-6,2), (-6,3). But at (-6,3), there's a wall. So can't get there. Alternatively, move right and up. For example, move right to (-5,-2), up to (-5,-1), etc., until reaching (-6,3). But this path might be blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe the key action here is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule. Given that the previous actions were trying to move right, perhaps the correct step is to continue moving right towards the ""is"" rule, assuming that the path is clear. Alternatively, maybe move up to reach the ""is"" rule faster.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at (3,4). From Baba's position (-6,-2), the direction to reach (3,4) is right 9 steps and up 6 steps. But considering the walls, maybe there's a better path. For example, move right to (0,-2), then up to (0,4), but there's a wall at (0,4). Hmm.

Alternatively, move up to (-6,1), then right to (3,1), then up to (3,4). But are there walls along this path? At (3,1), there's a rule `is` and others, but that's the destination. So maybe this path is possible.

So step by step:

1. Move up from (-6,-2) to (-6,-1), (-6,0), (-6,1). Check for walls. The observation says there's a wall at (-6,4), but moving up to (-6,1) should be clear.

2. From (-6,1), move right to (-5,1), (-4,1), ..., up to (3,1). Check for walls. The observation mentions walls at (1 step left and 3 step up), but that's at (-1,3), which is not on this path. So moving right should be clear.

3. From (3,1), move up to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) to reach the ""is"" rule.

Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it left to connect with ""baba"" at (-6,-2). But moving left from (3,4) to (-6,-2) is a long way, but perhaps possible by moving left and down step by step.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"". The ""win"" rule is at (5,4). So from (3,4), move right to (4,4), (5,4) to place the ""is"" next to ""win"", making ""win is ..."". But not sure.

Alternatively, place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"". Since ""baba"" is at (-6,-2), and ""win"" is at (5,4), placing ""is"" between them would require a lot of movement. Maybe instead, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together.

But given the limited actions, each step is a single direction, so the agent needs to make progress step by step. Given the previous failed actions, perhaps the correct action now is to move right towards the ""is"" rule, as that seems to be the key to manipulating the rules.

So the next action should be ""right"" to move closer to the ""is"" rule.

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are still ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". My goal is to reach the ball, which is acting as the win condition.

Looking at the current observation, the key is 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. The door is 5 steps to the left and 4 steps up. There are walls scattered around, and some rules on the right side. The ""is"" rules and ""win"" and ""ball"" text blocks are positioned towards the right. The player (Baba) is at 7 steps to the left and 2 steps down, along with an ""is"" and ""you"" rule nearby.

Hmm, the main obstacles here are the walls and the ""stop"" properties. The walls are blocking certain paths. The door is also there, but since the key is on the left, maybe I need to get the key first? Wait, the key's position is 6 steps left and 4 up. If I can move towards the key, but I have to navigate around the walls.

The current position of Baba is at 7 left, 2 down. The key is up and to the left. But there's a wall at 2 step left and 4 up, and rule `is` at 2 steps right and 4 up. The path to the key might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the grid.

Looking at the objects:

- Key is at 6 left, 4 up. So from Baba's position (7 left, 2 down), moving left and up would approach the key. But there's a wall at 2 left, 4 up. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check again.

The walls are:

- 1 step right and 4 up

- 2 steps left and 4 up

- 2 steps left and 3 up

- 2 steps left and 2 up

- 2 steps left and 1 up

- 2 steps left (floor level)

- 2 steps left and 1 down

- 2 steps left and 2 down

So the wall at 2 left, 4 up is blocking the direct path to the key (which is at 6 left, 4 up). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. The key is 6 steps to the left and 4 up from Baba's position. But the walls are at 2 left, 4 up. So Baba is at 7 left, 2 down. To get to the key at 6 left, 4 up, he needs to move left (from 7 to 6) and up 4 steps. But between him and the key, there's a wall at 2 left, 4 up. Wait, no, that wall is at 2 left, which is further to the right than the key's position. So maybe the path is clear?

Wait, perhaps the coordinates are relative. Let me parse the positions again.

Baba's position is rule `baba` at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `baba` is at ""5 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So from the starting point, moving 5 left and 2 down places Baba there.

The key is at ""6 step to the left and 4 step up"" from the starting point. So to reach the key, Baba needs to move left (from 5 to 6) and up 4 steps. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the walls:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up: that's to the right of the starting point.

- wall 2 step to the left and 4 step up: that's 2 left, 4 up. If Baba is at 5 left, 2 down, moving left to 6 left and up to 4 up, he would pass through positions 5 left, 3 up; 5 left, 4 up (which is a wall at 2 left, 4 up? Wait, no. The wall at 2 step to the left is 2 left from the starting point, not from Baba's position. This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to consider the grid relative to Baba's position.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are all relative to the top-left corner. But regardless, the key is to the left and up from Baba. The walls are at certain positions that might block the path.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to move towards the right to reach the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. Because if I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ball, but the ball is already designated as win. Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate other rules.

Wait, the current active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So if I can get to the ball, which is the win condition, then touching it would win the level. But the ball is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up from the starting point? Let me check the current objects:

rule `ball` is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, no, looking at the current observation:

rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up

rule `win` 3 steps to the right and 1 step up

So the ball is two steps right and one up, and win is three steps right and one up. The key is six steps left and four up. The door is five steps left and four up.

So the ball is near the bottom right, one step up. To reach it, I need to move right and up. But there's a wall at 2 steps left and 4 up, but that's further up. Let's see the path from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down) to the ball (2 right, 1 up):

From 5 left, 2 down, moving right to 2 right would require moving left (since 5 left is more to the left than 2 right?). Wait, maybe the coordinates are x and y axes. Let's assume that positive x is to the right, positive y is up.

So Baba's position is at x=5, y=2 (left and down). The ball is at x=2, y=1 (right and up). So to get there, he needs to move left from x=5 to x=2, and up from y=2 to y=1. But moving left from 5 to 2 is three steps left, and up one step.

But are there walls in that path? Looking at the walls:

- wall 2 step to the left and 4 up: that's x=2, y=4.

- wall 2 step to the left and 3 up: x=2, y=3.

- wall 2 step to the left and 2 up: x=2, y=2.

- wall 2 step to the left and 1 up: x=2, y=1.

Wait, the wall at x=2, y=1 is directly in the path of the ball. The ball is at x=2, y=1, but there's a wall at the same position. That can't be right. Wait, no, the ball is a text block, not a wall. The wall is at x=2, y=1, and the ball's text block is at x=2, y=1? That would mean the ball is behind a wall. But the active rule says ""ball is win"", so maybe the wall's ""stop"" property blocks movement, but since the ball is a text block, perhaps it's possible to move past it if it's not defined as stop. Wait, no. The wall is a separate object with a ""stop"" rule. The ball is a text block that says ""win"".

So the ball is at x=2, y=1, but there's a wall at x=2, y=1. Since the wall is defined as ""stop"", and the player is Baba, who is ""you"", moving into the wall would be stopped. But the ball is a separate object. So perhaps the player can move around the wall to reach the ball.

Wait, the wall is at the same position as the ball? That can't be. Let me check the current objects again:

Objects on the map include:

- rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up

- wall 2 steps to the left and 1 step up

Wait, no, looking at the current observation:

Objects:

- rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up

- wall 2 steps to the left and 1 step up

So the ball is at 2 right, 1 up, and there's a wall at 2 left, 1 up. That's different positions. So the ball is to the right of Baba's current position, one step up, and there's a wall to the left, one step up. So the path to the ball is from x=5 (Baba's x) to x=2 (ball's x), moving left three steps, and up one step. But between x=5 and x=2, there's a wall at x=2 left (which is x=3 if positive is right?), no, maybe the coordinates are absolute.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to approach this differently. The key points are:

- The goal is to reach the ball, which is the win condition.

- The ball is at a position that's reachable if there's no blocking wall.

- The player (Baba) is at 5 left, 2 down.

- There's a wall at 2 left, 1 up. So if the ball is at 2 right, 1 up, then moving right and up would avoid the wall.

Wait, the ball is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up from the starting point. So if Baba is at 5 left, 2 down, moving right would decrease his left steps. So from 5 left, moving right once brings him to 4 left, then 3, 2, 1, 0, etc. But the ball is at 2 right, which is x=2 (if right is positive). So perhaps the coordinates are relative to the starting point, with left being negative and right positive on the x-axis, and up being positive on the y-axis.

In that case, Baba's position is at (-5, -2) (5 left, 2 down). The ball is at (+2, +1). So the path from (-5, -2) to (+2, +1) requires moving right 7 units and up 3 units. But there are walls along the way.

Looking at the walls:

- wall at 2 left and 1 up: (-2, +1)

- wall at 2 left and 2 up: (-2, +2)

- wall at 2 left and 3 up: (-2, +3)

- wall at 2 left and 4 up: (-2, +4)

- wall at 1 step right and 4 up: (+1, +4)

Etc.

So the path from Baba to the ball would go through (-5, -2) → (-4, -2) → (-3, -2) → (-2, -2) → (-1, -2) → (0, -2) → (1, -2) → (2, -2) → (2, -1) → (2, 0) → (2, 1). But along this path, there's a wall at (-2, -2) (2 left, 2 down), but that's not on the direct path. Wait, no. The walls at 2 left and varying up are at (-2, +1), (-2, +2), etc. So moving right from Baba's position, he doesn't encounter those walls until he gets to x=-2. But his path to the ball is along x from -5 to +2, y from -2 to +1. The only wall in that area is at (-2, +1), which is the same x as the ball's x but one step up. So the ball is at (2,1), and the wall is at (-2,1). So they're on opposite sides of Baba's starting point. Therefore, the path should be clear except for possible other walls.

Wait, there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up: (+1, +4). Not in the way. So maybe the path is clear. Therefore, moving right and up would be the way to go.

But the previous actions were left and right, which didn't work. Maybe the assistant was trying to move towards the key instead. But the key is further left and up, which might not be necessary if the ball is directly reachable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the player needs to push a text block to change a rule. For example, to make ""YOU"" apply to Baba, but the current rule is ""baba is you"", so that's already satisfied.

Wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So Baba is the player, and the win condition is touching the ball. Therefore, the solution should be to move towards the ball.

But the ball is at (2 right, 1 up) from the starting point. If Baba is at (5 left, 2 down), moving right three times and up once should get him there. But the assistant's previous actions were left and right, which might not be leading towards the ball.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's current position. In that case, the objects' positions are relative to where Baba is. But I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing without a visual.

Given the time I've spent, I think the best action here is to move right towards the ball, as it's the win condition. So the chosen action should be right.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the ball which is defined as win. But how?

Looking at the active rules: ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, if I can get to the ball, I win. But the path might be blocked by walls or stops.

The objects on the map show the key, door, walls, and rules scattered around. The ball is at 1 step up, which seems close. But are there any stops or walls blocking the way?

Looking at the current position of Baba (rule `baba` is at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down). Wait, no—the rule `baba` is separate. The actual Baba object's position isn't directly listed here. Wait, the rules say ""baba is you"", so the player is controlled by the Baba text block. But where is that located? The observation lists ""rule `baba` 8 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So, the Baba rule is at that position, meaning the player is there.

The ball is at 1 step up from the rule `ball` which is at 1 step up. Wait, the ball object is at ""rule `ball` 4 steps to the right and 1 step up"" in some previous observations, but in the latest observation, the ball's position is ""rule `ball` 1 step up"". Hmm, maybe the ball object's position is directly given. Let me check the current observation again.

In the current observation, under Objects on the map, it says: ""rule `ball` 1 step up"". Wait, no—the ball is an object, so maybe the ball's position is listed separately. Let me parse the objects again.

Looking at the current objects:

- key 7 step to the left and 4 step up
- door 6 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 4 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `wall` 8 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 6 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `door` 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- rule `is` 5 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `ball` 1 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 step to the left
- rule `key` 2 steps to the right
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `baba` 8 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` 7 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `you` 6 step to the left and 2 steps down
- wall 3 step to the left and 2 steps down

Wait, the ball is listed as ""rule `ball` 1 step up"". But the actual ball object (the one that's win) should be present. Or is the ball defined by the rule ""ball is win""? So the ball's position is where the ""ball"" text block is located. Looking at the objects, the ""rule `ball`"" is at 1 step up. So the ball is at that position.

So the ball is at 1 step up from the current position of the rule `ball`, which is probably where the ball object is. But where is the player (Baba)? The rule `baba` is at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player is there.

To reach the ball at 1 step up, the player needs to move up. But are there any walls or stops in the way?

Looking at the path upwards from the player's position (8 left, 2 down):

- Step up: At 8 left, 1 down. Is there a wall or stop there? Checking objects:

There's a wall at 3 step to the left and 4 step up, but that's further up. The immediate positions above the player:

At 8 left, 1 down (which is the same as 8 left, 1 step up from the down position). The objects in that area: the rule `win` is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, which would be 7 left, 1 up. The wall at 3 left, 1 up. So between the player (8 left, 2 down) and the ball (1 step up), which is 8 left, 1 down (or 8 left, 1 up from the down position?), there's a wall at 3 left, 1 up. Wait, positions are a bit confusing here. The player is at 8 left and 2 down. The ball is at rule `ball` 1 step up. So the ball's position is 8 left, 1 down (since up from the player's position would be decreasing the down steps). So the direct path up from the player to the ball is clear? Let me check the map layout.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative. The player is at 8 left and 2 down. To move up, they would go towards lower down values. The ball is at 1 step up, which would be 8 left and 1 down. So the path is from 8 left, 2 down to 8 left, 1 down (up one step), which is directly possible if there's no wall or stop there.

Looking at the objects, is there a wall or stop at 8 left, 1 down? Checking the list:

- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step up: that's 5 left, 1 up. Not in the same column.
- rule `win` is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: 6 left, 1 up.
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step up: 5 left, 1 up.
- The wall at 3 left, 1 up is different.

So between the player's position (8 left, 2 down) and the ball (8 left, 1 down), there's nothing blocking. So moving up should be possible.

But wait, the active rules are ""ball is win"" and ""baba is you"", so moving up to the ball would make the player (Baba) win.

Therefore, the correct action is to move up once.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but in this case, the ""win"" rule might have been changed somehow.

Looking at the objects on the map, the ""key"" is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The ""door"" is 6 steps left and 3 up. There's a ""ball"" at 1 step up, and ""win"" is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, but the active rules now only show ""baba is you,"" so maybe the ""ball is win"" rule was removed earlier?

The walls are all positioned to the left, which might block certain paths. The ""is"" and ""win"" rules are to the right. Since I can move Baba (because of ""baba is you""), I need to see how to reach the ""win"" object. The ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, which might be a problem. 

Wait, maybe I need to manipulate the rules again. The ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to another text block, I could create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then it would make ""baba is win,"" changing the win condition to Baba. Then I could just reach Baba as the win. But where is Baba located?

Looking at the objects, ""rule `baba`"" is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a ""you"" rule somewhere. Oh, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 6 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" again or change it to something else. 

But the current active rule is only ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""win"" are present but not active. To activate ""win,"" I need to have a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""win is you."" Since I can move text blocks, perhaps I should move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and another subject. For instance, moving ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" making ""baba is win."" Then, since Baba is you, reaching Baba would mean winning.

But how to get there? The ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. From the current position of Baba (rule `baba` at 8 left, 3 down), moving right and up would be necessary. But there are walls blocking the path. The wall at 3 left and 3 up might be a stop, but since I can move Baba (as ""baba is you""), maybe walls aren't stops unless they have the ""stop"" property. Let me check the walls' properties.

Looking at the objects, the walls are at various positions but the ""rule `stop`"" is at 6 left and 2 up. So maybe some walls are stop. But if I can get past them by moving around. Alternatively, using the key to open a door. The door is at 6 left and 3 up. If I have a key, I can move it to the door to unlock it. The key is at 7 left and 3 up. So, moving the key towards the door (which is 6 left, 3 up) would require moving the key one step to the left. Then place it on the door, making the door passable.

But how to move the key? Since I'm Baba, I can move objects that are not stopped. The key isn't stopped, so I can pick it up and move it. So the steps would be: move towards the key, pick it up, move it to the door, then go through the door to the win area.

Alternatively, if I can change the ""win"" rule to be triggered by reaching Baba. By moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" creating ""baba is win."" Then, since Baba is you, just reaching Baba would make you win. But where is the ""baba"" text block? It's at 8 left, 3 down. To get there, need to move overcoming the walls. The path might be blocked by walls at 3 left and 3 up, but if I can find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the current win condition is still the ball, but the ""ball is win"" rule was removed. If I can find the ball and move it to where I am, but the ball is at 1 step up. Not sure.

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 6 left and 3 down. If I can make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the active rule. Maybe combine ""you"" with another property. For example, move ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win,"" then since you are Baba, you would be win.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 1 right, 3 up to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win."" ""Baba"" is at 8 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""is"" is at 1 right, 3 up. So the ""is"" is between the ""win"" and somewhere else. Maybe moving the ""is"" up to be next to ""win"" and then next to ""baba.""

Alternatively, move the ""is"" towards the ""baba"" location. But the distance is quite big. Maybe step by step.

Alternatively, check if the door can be opened with the key. The key is at 7 left, 3 up. The door is at 6 left, 3 up. So moving the key one step left to the door's position, then the door becomes passable. Then go through the door to the area where ""win"" is located at 2 right, 3 up.

So the plan would be:

1. Move towards the key at 7 left, 3 up.
2. Pick up the key and move it to the door at 6 left, 3 up.
3. Open the door and proceed to the win area.

But how to move the key? Since I'm Baba, I can move the key by stepping on it and then moving it. So first, navigate from my position (which I need to check) to the key. Wait, where is Baba located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? The observation shows ""rule `baba` 8 step to the left and 3 steps down."" Assuming the reference point is the player's position, but the exact starting point isn't clear. Alternatively, the coordinates might be relative to the map's grid.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe focus on the immediate objects. The ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from the current observation's perspective. There's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, which is a stop. But since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can move through stop objects? Wait, no. If an object has ""stop"" property, it blocks movement unless you have a rule that says otherwise. Since the current rules don't override ""stop,"" I probably can't move through walls marked as stop.

So, the key at 7 left, 3 up is nearby. If I can get the key to the door at 6 left, 3 up, then the door becomes passable. Once the door is open, I can go through to the win area. 

So the actions would be:

- Move left to reach the key.
- Pick up the key (by moving onto it? In Baba Is You, you push objects by moving into them from the side.)
- Move the key left to the door's position.
- Open the door by moving into it with the key.
- Move up and right to the win area.

But how to translate this into specific actions given the step-by-step observations. The previous actions were moving left, right, up, down. So in the current observation, the key is at 7 left and 3 up. If the player (Baba) is at a certain position, say, origin, then moving left 7 steps would reach the key. But that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe the player is near the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up. So moving left from there to reach the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 8 left, 3 down. So to get to the key at 7 left, 3 up, the player would need to move right and up. But there's a wall at 3 left, 3 up. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check again.

Looking at the current objects:

- Wall at 3 step to the left and 3 step up.
- Another wall at 3 step to the left and 2 step up.
- Wall at 3 step to the left and 1 step up.
- Wall at 3 step to the left (base level).
- Walls further down.

So moving from the ""baba"" position (8 left, 3 down) to the key at 7 left, 3 up would require moving left 1 step and up 6 steps, but there are walls blocking the path at 3 left, which is much closer. So this path is blocked.

Alternative route: Use the door. The door is at 6 left, 3 up. If I can open it with the key, then go through. To get the key, perhaps move to the key's location, pick it up, move it to the door.

But again, the path to the key is blocked by walls. Maybe need to find another way. 

Wait, the ""rule `is`"" is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""baba,"" then create a new rule. For example, move ""is"" to connect ""baba"" (8 left, 3 down) and ""win"" (2 right, 3 up). But the distance is too great. Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by placing ""is"" between them.

But physically moving the ""is"" rule would require navigating around the walls. The ""is"" is at 1 right, 3 up. To get to ""baba"" at 8 left, 3 down, the ""is"" would have to move left and down, but there are walls at 3 left, 3 up. So maybe not feasible.

Alternative idea: Since the key is nearby, and the door is one step left from the key, perhaps the key is adjacent to the door. So moving the key to the door's position would open it. Then go through the door to the win area.

Assuming the key is at 7 left, 3 up, and the door is at 6 left, 3 up. So moving the key left once would place it on the door, making it passable. Then Baba can move left through the door.

So the steps would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (8 left, 3 down) to the key's location (7 left, 3 up). The direction would be left once and up six times, but blocked by walls. Hmm, not possible.

Alternatively, if the player is at the ""is"" rule's position (1 right, 3 up), then moving left to reach the key at 7 left would require moving left 8 steps, which is impossible due to walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is to push the ""key"" towards the ""door"" by moving around. Since the key is at 7 left, 3 up, and the door is at 6 left, 3 up, the key is one step to the right of the door. So if I can move the key left once, it would unlock the door. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the key and push it left.

Assuming the player (Baba) is near the key. If the player is at 7 left, 3 up (the key's position), then moving left would push the key to 6 left, 3 up, opening the door. Then the player can move left through the door.

But where is the player located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 8 left, 3 down. So the player is at 8 left, 3 down. To reach the key at 7 left, 3 up, the player needs to move left once and up six times, but there's a wall at 3 left, 3 up. So that path is blocked.

Alternative path: Maybe go around the walls using other rules. If I can change the ""stop"" property of a wall, but that would require moving text blocks to create a new rule like ""wall is not stop,"" which is unlikely.

Alternatively, use the ""key"" to move past the door. If I bring the key to the door, then the door becomes passable. So the steps are:

1. Move from Baba's position (8 left, 3 down) to the key's location (7 left, 3 up). But the path is obstructed by walls at 3 left, 3 up. So this isn't possible unless there's another route.

Wait, maybe the player can move through walls if they have the right rules. But currently, the only rule is ""baba is you,"" which doesn't grant pass through walls. The walls have the ""stop"" property, so they block movement unless overridden.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that makes ""baba"" equivalent to ""win."" By moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" forming ""baba is win."" Then, since Baba is you, reaching Baba would make you win. 

To do that, the ""is"" rule needs to be placed between ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 8 left, 3 down, and ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" rule down to be near ""baba"" and then right to connect to ""win.""

But moving the ""is"" rule from 1 right, 3 up to 8 left, 3 down is a long distance, blocked by walls. Not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since the ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up, maybe move the ""is"" rule up to be next to ""win,"" then move it left to connect to ""baba."" For example:

1. Move ""is"" from (1 right, 3 up) up to (1 right, 4 up), but there's a wall at 4 step up (probably).
2. Alternatively, move ""is"" right to 2 right, 3 up, next to ""win."" Then move it left to connect to ""baba"" at 8 left, 3 down. Still too far.

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that the ""key"" is needed to open the ""door,"" which is adjacent to the ""win"" area. So even though the path is blocked, using the key to open the door allows access.

Assuming the player can reach the key and move it to the door:

- Move towards the key (7 left, 3 up) from Baba's position (8 left, 3 down). But how? The direction would be left and up, but walls are in the way.

Wait, maybe the player is at the position of the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up. Then moving left to reach the key at 7 left would require moving left 8 steps, which is impossible. I'm getting stuck here.

Perhaps the key is already in a position that allows it to be moved easily. The key is at 7 left, 3 up, and the door is at 6 left, 3 up. So the key is one step to the right of the door. If the player can push the key left, they can unlock the door.

To push the key, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where the key is. So if the player is at 7 left, 3 up (same as the key), moving left would push the key to 6 left, 3 up. Then the door becomes passable.

But where is the player located? If the player is at the ""baba"" rule's position (8 left, 3 down), they need to move up and left to reach the key. But the path is blocked. Unless there's a way around the walls by moving through other objects.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""is"" rule to create a new path. For example, create a rule that allows moving through walls, but that would require specific text blocks.

Another possibility: The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" so the player is Baba. The ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If there's a way to reach that position without obstacles, perhaps by changing the rules.

Wait, looking at the objects, the ""rule `win`"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. The ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" forming ""baba is win,"" then reaching Baba would make me win. 

To do that, the ""is"" needs to be placed between ""baba"" and ""win."" ""Baba"" is at 8 left, 3 down. ""Win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""is"" is at 1 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" rule down to 3 down and right to connect with ""baba"" is impossible due to walls.

This is really challenging. Maybe the answer is to simply move up towards the ""win"" rule, assuming that the path is clear. But given the walls, that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ""win"" object is adjacent to the player's current position. Looking at the current observation, the ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from wherever the player is. If the player is near there, moving up and right would work. But without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think the intended action here is to move up towards the ""win"" location, hoping that the path has become clear by manipulating rules earlier","

Let's see. The active rule here is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules. The goal is to reach the win condition. Right now, the key is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. But the door is 6 steps left and 3 steps up. There's a wall blocking the path directly to the door.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Since I'm Baba, I can move that `is` rule somewhere else to create a new rule. The goal is to make sure I can get past the walls or change the win condition. 

The current active rules don't have ""ball is win"" anymore. The previous step must have removed that. So the win condition might be somewhere else, maybe the door or another object. But the door is behind walls. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition. 

To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" Let's check the positions. The `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I move up from my current position, which is probably near the `baba` rule, I can reach that `is` rule. Once I have the `is` rule, I can place it between ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" Then, I could just move to where I am, making myself the win. 

So the steps would be: move up to grab the `is` rule, then move to the `win` rule and place the `is` there, creating ""baba is win."" After that, since I'm Baba and the win condition is now me, I just need to stay in place or move to my position. 

Wait, but how do I know my current position? The objects list doesn't explicitly state where I am. But typically, in Baba Is You, you control Baba, so my position is likely where the `baba` text block is. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 8 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So I'm at that position. 

From there, I need to move up to the `is` rule at 1 step right and 3 steps up. Let's calculate the direction. If I'm 8 left and 3 down, and the `is` is 1 right and 3 up, then I need to move right once and up three steps. Wait, but movement is step by step. So first, move right once to get to 7 left, 3 down. Then up to 7 left, 2 down. Then up again to 7 left, 1 down. Then up to 7 left, 0 down (which is same as 3 up from original position). Then right once to reach the `is` rule at 1 right and 3 up. 

Once I have the `is` rule, I need to move to the `win` rule. The `win` rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. From where I have the `is` rule (1 right, 3 up), I can move right once to get to 2 right, 3 up, which is where the `win` rule is. Then place the `is` there to make ""baba is win."" 

After that, since I'm Baba and the win condition is now me, I just need to stay in place. So the actions would be: right, up, up, up, right (to get to the `is`), then right, up, up, up, right again? Wait, maybe I need to break down the steps more carefully. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to reach the `is` rule. Let's see. Current position: 8 left, 3 down. To get to the `is` at 1 right, 3 up: the difference is 9 steps left to right (8 to 1 is 7 steps right) and 6 steps up (3 down to 3 up is 6 up). But movement is one step at a time. So first, move right 7 times to get to 1 left, 3 down. Then move up 6 times to reach 1 left, 3 up (the `is` rule). Then pick up the `is` rule. 

After that, move to the `win` rule at 2 right, 3 up. From 1 left, 3 up, moving right 3 times would get to 2 right, 3 up. Then place the `is` there alongside `win` to create ""baba is win."" 

Once that rule is active, I can just stay in place because I'm Baba and the win condition is me. So the actions would involve moving right multiple times, then up, then moving to the win position. 

But the problem is that each step can only be one action. So the user is expecting a single action here. Wait, no, looking back, in the problem statement, the user lists possible actions as idle, up, right, down, left. So each action is a single step in one direction. 

But in the current observation, after previous failed attempts, the game might have changed the map. The latest observation shows that the active rule is only ""baba is you,"" and the win condition is unclear. The key is still there, but the door is blocked. 

So the immediate action needed is to either move towards the `is` rule to create a new rule or move towards the win condition. But since the win condition's position isn't clear, creating a rule that makes Baba the win might be the way. 

To do that, I need to retrieve the `is` rule. The `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from my current position (assuming my position is where the `baba` rule is, which is 8 step left and 3 step down). So from there, moving right once and up three times would get me to the `is` rule. But each action is a single step. So the first action should be 'right' to move towards the `is` rule. 

Alternatively, if the `is` rule is in another location, maybe I need to adjust. But based on the observation, the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So moving right first would be the correct initial step. 

Therefore, the chosen action is 'right' to head towards the `is` rule to create the necessary rule to make myself the win.

Let's try to figure out what to do next in Baba Is You. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and push things. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, the ""win"" rule is present at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's also a door at 6 steps to the left and 3 steps up, and a key at 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The walls are blocking some paths, and there are ""stop"" rules that make certain objects immovable.

My current position isn't specified, but the active rules and objects are listed. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The key might be necessary to open the door, but the door's position (6 left, 3 up) is close to the win condition (2 right, 3 up). Maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to change what's win or how to get past the walls.

The ""is"" rules are scattered. If I can move a rule like ""win"" somewhere else or change it to something else, maybe I can make Baba itself the win condition. For example, if I can create ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would win the level. But to do that, I need to find the ""win"" text block and move it next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" rule.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `win` at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a rule `is` at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can push the ""win"" block to the left next to ""baba"" and the ""is"" block, then combining them would create ""baba is win."" That would make touching Baba the win condition. 

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block. The ""win"" block is at 2 steps right, 3 up. There's a wall at 3 left, 3 up, but maybe there's a path. Let me check the surrounding objects. The key is at 7 left, 3 up, which is further left. The door is at 6 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. 

If I move right from my current position (assuming I'm near the ""win"" rule), I can push the ""win"" block left towards the ""baba"" rule. But wait, the ""win"" block is at 2 right, 3 up. To get to the ""baba"" rule, which is at 8 left, 3 steps down, that's a bit further. Maybe there's a different approach. Alternatively, maybe moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" would work. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then getting the key would make me win. The key is at 7 left, 3 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the key's location, then ""key is win"" would be created. But the key is blocked by walls? Let me check. The key is at 7 left, 3 up, and there's a wall at 3 left, 3 up. So maybe the path is blocked. 

Another angle: The door is at 6 left, 3 up. If I can open the door by moving a ""stop"" rule away or changing the door's property. But the door's rule is ""door"" at 1 right, 1 step up. To make the door not a stop, I might need to change the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left, 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere, the door might become passable. 

But how to move those rules? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can push text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule makes objects immovable, but if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then other blocks can be moved. For example, the ""stop"" is at 6 left, 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to another location, then the door (which is a stop) might no longer be blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the existing ""win"" rule at 2 right, 3 up. But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the grid. 

Assuming my position is somewhere in the area, but since it's not specified, I have to work with the object positions. The ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. To get there, I might need to move through the map. The walls are at 3 left, 3 up; 3 left, 2 up; etc. The ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up is adjacent to the ""win"" rule. So if I can get to that area, I could push the ""win"" block left next to ""baba."" 

But how to push the ""win"" block? I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. The ""win"" block is at 2 right, 3 up. If I'm to the left of it, I can push it right, but that's not helpful. If I'm to the right, I can push it left. But where am I? 

Given that the active rules are ""baba is you,"" and the previous actions were moving right repeatedly, maybe I'm moving towards the ""win"" rule. The last action was ""right,"" which might have positioned me next to the ""win"" or ""is"" rule. 

If I'm next to the ""win"" rule at 2 right, 3 up, pushing it left towards the ""baba"" rule (which is at 8 left, 3 steps down) would require multiple steps. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

Another possibility: The ""key"" is at 7 left, 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe that's required to open the door. But the door is at 6 left, 3 up, which is adjacent to the key. So if I have the key, I can push the door? But the door is a ""stop"" unless the ""stop"" rule is removed. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Active rule: ""baba is you"" (I can move and push).
- Goal: Likely reach ""win,"" but it's possible the win condition has changed.
- Key is at 7 left, 3 up. Door at 6 left, 3 up (adjacent to key).
- ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up.
- ""is"" rules are at 1 right, 3 up and others.
- ""stop"" rule at 6 left, 2 up.

Possible steps:

1. Move towards the ""win"" rule at 2 right, 3 up. But path might be blocked by walls at 3 left, 3 up. Wait, the walls are at 3 left, 3 up; 3 left, 2 up; etc. So from the ""win"" position (2 right, 3 up), moving left would pass through 1 right, 3 up (the ""is"" rule), then to 0 right, 3 up. But is there a wall there? There's a wall at 3 left, which would be 0 right if the origin is somewhere else. Maybe the coordinates are relative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to create a new rule ""baba is win."" To do this, I need to have the ""baba"" text block, an ""is"" rule, and the ""win"" text block all adjacent. 

Looking at the current setup:

- ""baba"" rule is at 8 left, 3 steps down.
- ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up.
- ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up.

If I can move the ""is"" rule to be between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then combining them would create ""baba is win."" To move the ""is"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can push it left towards the ""baba"" rule, which is at 8 left, 3 steps down. Wait, that's a different direction. The ""baba"" rule is further left and down from the ""is"" rule. 

This might require moving the ""is"" rule in a different direction. Let's see:

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. To get it next to ""baba,"" which is at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down, I need to move the ""is"" rule left and down. But can I push it in those directions? 

Assuming I'm able to move the ""is"" rule, perhaps by being adjacent to it and pushing it left and down. However, the path might be blocked by walls. For example, moving left from the ""is"" rule's position (1 right, 3 up) would take it to 0 right, 3 up. Is there a wall there? There's a wall at 3 left, 3 up, which is 0 right if the origin is at 3 left. This is getting confusing without a visual map. 

Alternatively, maybe focus on moving the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up. If I can push it left to be next to the ""is"" rule (1 right, 3 up), then they would combine to ""win is [something],"" which isn't helpful. But if I can push the ""win"" rule further left past the ""is"" rule, then next to ""baba,"" that would work. 

But the ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. To push the ""win"" rule left from 2 right to 1 right, I need to be on the left side of the ""win"" rule. If I'm at 1 right, 3 up (the ""is"" rule's position), I can't push the ""win"" rule left past it unless I move first. 

This is quite complex. Maybe a simpler approach is to check if the door can be opened. The door is at 6 left, 3 up, and it's a ""stop"" because of the ""stop"" rule at 6 left, 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, the door might no longer be a stop. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left, 2 up. If I can push it to another location, say down or right, then the door at 6 left, 3 up would no longer be blocked by ""stop."" For example, moving the ""stop"" rule down to 6 left, 3 up, but that's where the door is. Alternatively, moving it right to 7 left, 2 up. 

To push the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""stop"" is at 6 left, 2 up. If I can get to that position and push it, say, to the right (7 left, 2 up), then the door's ""stop"" property might be removed. 

But how to reach the ""stop"" rule? The path might be blocked by walls. The wall at 3 left, 3 up is in the way. Unless there's a way around. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 7 left, 3 up, and the ""stop"" rule is at 6 left, 2 up, maybe moving the key first. But the key is at 7 left, 3 up, and to get it, I might need to push past walls. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the ""win"" rule at 2 right, 3 up to see if I can reach it. But how? The ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up. If I'm to the left of it, I can push it right, but that's not helpful. If I'm to the right, I can push it left. 

Assuming I'm next to the ""win"" rule, pushing it left towards the ""is"" rule (1 right, 3 up) would create ""win is [something],"" which isn't useful. But if I can get the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then combining them would create ""baba is win."" 

Another thought: The ""key"" is at 7 left, 3 up. If I can get the key and then place it near the ""win"" rule, maybe ""key is win"" would be created. But I need an ""is"" rule to do that. 

Alternatively, since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can just walk towards the existing ""win"" rule at 2 right, 3 up. But I need to navigate around the walls. The walls are at 3 left, 3 up; 3 left, 2 up; etc. So from the ""win"" position (2 right, 3 up), moving left would go through 1 right, 3 up (the ""is"" rule), then to 0 right, 3 up. Is there a wall there? According to the objects, there's a wall at 3 left, 3 up, which would be 0 right if the origin is 3 left. So moving left from the ""win"" rule's position (2 right, 3 up) to 1 right, 3 up (the ""is"") is possible, then to 0 right, 3 up. But if there's a wall at 0 right, 3 up, then I can't go further. 

This is getting too confusing without a clear map. Given the previous actions of moving right multiple times, maybe the agent is moving towards the ""win"" rule. The last few actions were right, leading to this observation. Now, the active rule is just ""baba is you,"" and the ""win"" is still at 2 right, 3 up. 

Perhaps the correct action is to move up towards the ""win"" rule. The previous observation had the ""win"" at 3 step up, but in the latest observation, it's at 3 step up as well. Wait, no, in the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So if I'm positioned to the left of that, moving right would get me closer. 

Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, adjacent to the ""win"" rule, maybe pushing the ""win"" rule left to be next to ""baba."" But ""baba"" is at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is quite far. 

Wait, maybe there's a different rule I'm missing. The ""key"" is present, but I don't see a ""key is win"" rule. If I can create that, then getting the key would win the level. To create ""key is win,"" I need the ""key"" text block, an ""is"" rule, and the ""win"" text block adjacent. 

The ""key"" is at 7 left, 3 up. The ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rules are at 1 right, 3 up and others. It's a far distance between key and win. Maybe not feasible. 

Another angle: The door is at 6 left, 3 up, adjacent to the key. If I can open the door by removing the ""stop"" rule, then I can go through the door. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left, 2 up. If I can push that ""stop"" rule away, say down to 6 left, 3 up (where the door is), then the door's ""stop"" property would be removed. But can I push the ""stop"" rule there? The door is a separate object; pushing the ""stop"" rule onto it might not remove the stop property. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""door"" rule to a different position, but the door's rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. 

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the previous actions, maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the ""win"" rule, as that's the usual win condition. Alternatively, try to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

But without knowing my exact position, it's hard to say. Given the history of moving right, maybe continuing that direction to reach the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, moving up to get closer. 

Considering the latest observation, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and the ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. If I can push the ""win"" rule left to be next to the ""is"" rule, then combining them would create ""win is [something], but that's not helpful. However, if I can get the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would be created. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule. Let's say I'm at the ""is"" rule's position (1 right, 3 up). If I push it left, it would go to 0 right, 3 up. Then, if I can push it further left to be next to ""baba"" (which is at 8 left, 3 down), that's a big distance. Not practical. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different ""is"" rule further down. There's another ""is"" rule at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that one. 

Alternatively, focus on the ""baba"" rule at 8 left, 3 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and the ""win"" rule. 

This is quite complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best action is to move right towards the ""win"" rule, as that's the most direct path to the existing win condition. Alternatively, move up to reach the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. 

Looking at the latest observation, the ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. The agent's previous action was ""right,"" which might have moved them closer. So the next logical step is to move right again to reach the ""win"" rule. 

Alternatively, move up to get to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules at 3 step up.","

Let's see. The user has been trying to solve a Baba Is You puzzle. They've been moving right a lot, but the game kept defaulting to idle because the actions weren't valid. Now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever Baba touches becomes part of the player.

Looking at the current observation, the key is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is at 6 left, 3 up. There are walls and rules scattered around. The ""is"" rule is to the right at 3 steps up, and the ""win"" and ""ball"" rules are also nearby. But the key is behind some walls, I think. The user probably needs to move towards the key to get it, but the path might be blocked by walls defined as ""stop.""

Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" moving Baba towards the key should be possible. The previous attempts to go right might have been hitting a STOP wall. Let me check the map layout again. The key is 7 steps left and 3 up. If the user is positioned somewhere, maybe they need to move left or up to reach the key. Alternatively, they might need to rearrange the rules to remove the STOP property from the walls.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If the user can move that ""is"" rule next to a wall or another object, they could change its property. For example, if they move ""is"" to make ""wall is stop"" into something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing."" But the user needs to move the text blocks, which requires them to be movable, i.e., not defined as STOP.

Looking at the objects, the walls are at various positions, and some have ""stop"" properties. The rule `stop` is at 6 step left and 3 step up. If the user can reach that ""stop"" rule and move it, they could remove the STOP property from walls. Alternatively, they could create a new rule like ""key is win"" to make the key the win condition instead of the ball.

But the active rules now only have ""baba is you."" The ""ball is win"" rule is no longer present. So the goal might have changed. The user needs to reach the key or the door. The door is at 6 left, 3 up, but it's probably locked unless the key is used. The key is at 7 left, 3 up, which is to the left of the door. So the path to the key might be blocked by walls. 

If the user moves right towards the key, they might encounter a wall that's STOP. Since they're Baba, maybe they can push the wall if it's not STOP. Wait, no, if a wall is STOP, you can't push or move through it. So the user needs to either remove the STOP property from the walls or find a way around them.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If the user can move this ""is"" to attach to a wall, they could change its property. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" would make ""wall is stop,"" but if they move it to make ""stop is you,"" that might not help. Alternatively, creating ""baba is win"" would let them touch the door or key and win.

But the user needs to physically move the text blocks. Let's say the user is positioned near the ""is"" rule at 1 step right, 3 up. If they move right again, they might reach the ""win"" rule at 2 steps right, 3 up. By moving the ""is"" next to ""win"" and another object, they could create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" making ""baba is win,"" which would let them win by touching themselves.

But how to get to that position? The user's current position isn't specified, but based on the objects, maybe they're near the ""is"" rule. If they move right, they could reach the ""win"" rule. Then, by rearranging the ""is"" to link ""baba"" with ""win,"" they could change the win condition. Alternatively, moving the ""key"" rule to a different position.

Another approach: Since the key is at 7 left, 3 up, and the user is probably positioned somewhere else, they might need to move left towards the key. But the path might be blocked. If they can change a wall to a non-stop property, they could pass through. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule away from the wall so that the wall no longer has the STOP property.

Alternatively, if the user can make themselves a pusher, they could move walls. But the current rules don't have that. The active rule is only ""baba is you,"" so they can touch objects but can't push unless the rule allows it.

Given all this, the best action might be to move towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step right, 3 up, then rearrange it to create a new rule that removes STOP from walls or changes the win condition. But the user needs to physically move the ""is"" text block. Since they can only move objects that are not STOP, they need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. If it's not STOP, they can move it.

Assuming the ""is"" rule is movable, moving it to connect ""baba"" with ""win"" would create ""baba is win,"" letting them touch themselves to win. So the steps would be: move right to reach the ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule. But the user needs to give a single action, like moving right, left, up, down, or idle.

In the current observation, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If the user is positioned to the left of that, moving right once would get them next to it. Then, they could potentially move it further, but the action required here is just the next move. So the best immediate action is to move right to reach the ""is"" rule, allowing them to then rearrange the rules to change the win condition.

Let's see where I am right now. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can control Baba. My goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, I see a ball labeled as WIN. But I don't know if that's the current WIN because the initial rules might have changed. Wait, in the current observation, the active rules only show ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""ball is win"" are probably not active anymore. So the WIN condition might have reverted to the default, which is often the flag or a specific object, but here I see a ball that was previously WIN. But since the rule ""ball is win"" isn't active now, maybe the actual WIN is somewhere else or maybe I need to change the rules again.

There's a key nearby at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. But I need to get past the walls and stops. The walls are to the left and right, and there's a door at 6 steps left and 3 steps up. Do I need the key to open the door? The door is probably a STOP, meaning it can't be passed unless I change its property. But how?

Since I'm Baba and can move, I need to figure out how to reach the WIN. The ball was WIN before, but rules have changed. Maybe I need to rewrite the rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. For example, there's a rule `is` at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" next to another text block, I can create a new rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can pair that with a subject using the `is` rule, I can make something WIN again. But to do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to the `win` rule. Let's see the positions:

- rule `is` is at 1 step right and 3 steps up.
- rule `win` is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up.

So if I move right from the `is` rule, I can attach it to the `win` rule, making something like ""X IS WIN."" But what's X here? There's a rule `ball` at 1 step up, but that's not adjacent. Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new subject. Wait, there's a rule `baba` at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that up, maybe pair it with `is` and `win` to make ""baba is win.""

But how to get there? Let's map my current position. The `baba` rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. If I'm controlling the Baba object, which is likely at the position of the `baba` text block, then I need to move towards the `is` and `win` rules. However, there are walls blocking the path. For example, wall 3 steps left and 3 steps up is in the way. Maybe I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` rule to the right next to the `win` rule. If I move the `is` rule one step to the right, it would be adjacent to `win`, creating ""is win,"" which doesn't make sense. Wait, the rules are formed as ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So to create a new rule, I need a subject, then an `is`, then a property. So if I can move the `is` rule next to a subject and then next to a property, I can form a new rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a `rule `ball`` at 1 step up. If I can move the `is` rule next to `ball` and then next to `win`, that would make ""ball is win"" again. But the current active rules don't have that, so maybe that's the solution. Let's see the positions:

- `ball` is at 1 step up.
- `is` is at 1 step right and 3 steps up.
- `win` is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up.

If I can move the `is` rule from (1 right, 3 up) to be next to `ball` at 1 step up, then place `win` next to that. But the positions are a bit spread out. Maybe I need to move the `is` rule to the left to be adjacent to `ball`.

Alternatively, perhaps moving the `win` rule next to `is` and a subject. But the `win` rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I move it left to be adjacent to `is` at 1 step right, then they would be next to each other. Then, if there's a subject adjacent to `is`, like `baba`, that could form ""baba is win.""

But the `baba` rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, which is far away. Maybe that's not the way. Another approach: the `key` is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can get the key and use it to open a door, but the door is at 6 steps left and 3 steps up, which is a STOP. To pass through the door, I might need to change its property from STOP to something else, but I don't see a way to do that right now.

Alternatively, maybe the WIN condition is now at a different location. Looking at the objects, there's a `rule `win`` at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, but that's a text block, not an actual WIN object. The actual WIN might be a separate object that's not listed here, or maybe it's the ball which was previously WIN but the rule was removed.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's recap:

- Active rule: baba is you (so I can control Baba).
- Need to find WIN. Previously, ball was WIN, but that rule is gone.
- Available text blocks: key, door, is, win, wall, stop, baba.
- To create a new rule, I need to move an `is` block between a subject and a property.

Possible actions:

1. Move towards the `is` block at 1 step right and 3 steps up to combine it with adjacent blocks.
2. Move the `win` block next to a subject to make that subject WIN.
3. Try to reach the ball (if it's the WIN now, but the rule is missing).
4. Interact with the door, but it's a STOP unless changed.

Let me focus on creating a new WIN rule. If I can make ""baba is win,"" that would mean I (Baba) am the WIN. So I need to move the `is` block next to `baba` and then next to `win`.

The `baba` rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. The `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. These are quite far apart. To move the `is` block closer to `baba`, I need to navigate through the walls. But the path might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe move the `baba` rule up, but I don't know if I can move the text blocks; I think I can only move objects that are not STOP or similar.

Wait, the tips say I can only move objects or text that are not defined as STOP or similar. So the `is`, `win`, `wall`, `stop`, `baba`, `key`, `door` rules might be movable unless they are STOP. In this case, the active rules include ""baba is you,"" so Baba is movable. The other rules like `is`, `win`, etc., are likely movable unless specified otherwise.

So, I can try to move the `is` rule towards the `baba` rule. Let's see the positions again. The `is` is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. The `baba` rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. To get from `is` to `baba`, I need to move left and down, but there are walls in the way. For example, wall 3 steps left and 3 steps up is to the left of the `is` rule. So moving left from `is` would hit a wall.

Alternatively, maybe move the `baba` rule up. The `baba` rule is at 8 left, 3 down. If I can move it up 3 steps, it would reach the `is` and `win` rules area. But how? To move the `baba` rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Since I'm controlling Baba (the object), I need to move towards the `baba` text block and then push it.

Wait, the `rule `baba`` is a text block, and I'm an object named Baba. According to the rules, since ""baba is you,"" I can push text blocks if they're not STOP. The `rule `baba`` is a text block, and unless there's a rule saying it's STOP, I can move it. So, if I move towards the `rule `baba`` at 8 left and 3 down, I can push it. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up. To reach the `baba` rule at 8 left and 3 down, I need to move down from my current position. Wait, I'm not sure where I am exactly. The observation lists objects relative to somewhere, but the exact position of the player (Baba) isn't specified. This is a bit tricky without knowing the player's location.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the `baba` text block's position. If so, moving down would take me towards the `rule `baba`` itself, but that might not help. Alternatively, moving up to reach the `is` and `win` rules.

Another approach: since the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, and the `win` rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, if I can move the `is` rule one step to the right, it would be adjacent to `win`, making ""is win"" which doesn't make sense. But if there's a subject adjacent to `is`, like `key` at 1 step up, then moving `is` next to `key` and `win` would create ""key is win.""

The `key` is at 1 step up. If I can move the `is` rule from (1 right, 3 up) to be next to `key` at 1 step up, then place `win` next to that, it would form ""key is win."" Then, picking up the key (which is WIN now) and using it to open a door? But the door is a STOP, so unless I change its property.

Alternatively, if I make ""key is win,"" then grabbing the key would make me WIN. But how do I interact with the key? In Baba Is You, touching a WIN object wins the level. So if I can make the key a WIN by creating ""key is win,"" then touching the key would win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the `is` rule next to the `key` object.
2. Then move the `win` rule next to the `is` rule to form ""key is win.""
3. Then move to the key and touch it to win.

Let's check the positions:

- `key` is at 1 step up.
- `is` is at 1 step right and 3 steps up.
- `win` is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up.

To get `is` next to `key`, I need to move `is` left from (1 right, 3 up) to (0 right, 3 up), which is adjacent to `key` at 1 step up. Wait, the coordinates might be a bit different. If the `key` is at 1 step up, and the `is` is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, then the `is` is diagonally right and 2 steps up from the `key`? This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the `key` is directly above the `is` rule. If I move the `is` rule up one step, it would be under the `key`, forming ""key is win"" if `win` is next to it. But I need to check the exact positions.

Given the uncertainty in positions, perhaps the best immediate action is to move right towards the `is` rule to get closer to the `win` rule and see if I can form a new rule. Alternatively, move up to reach higher ground where the `is` and `win` rules are located.

Another possibility: the door is a STOP, but if I can change its property to, say, ""door is you,"" then I could push through. But to do that, I need to create a rule ""door is you."" However, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I make ""door is you,"" then I could control the door. But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push past the STOP door if there's a rule allowing it. But without a ""push"" rule or similar, I probably can't.

Given all this, the most promising path seems to be creating a new WIN rule by combining `key`, `is`, and `win`. To do that, I need to maneuver the `is` rule next to `key` and then `win`. The action would involve moving right or left to position the `is` rule appropriately.

Since the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, and the `key` is at 1 step up, moving the `is` rule left by one step would place it next to the `key`, then move the `win` rule next to that. But how to do this as actions?

Each action is a single step: up, down, left, right. So I need to sequence these steps to move the `is` rule. For example:

1. Move left from `is`'s current position to be adjacent to `key`.
2. Then move right to place `win` next to `is`.

But each action is a single step, so perhaps the immediate action is to move left towards the `key`.

Alternatively, if I'm at the position of the `baba` text block, which is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, moving up would bring me towards the `is` and `win` rules. But there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, so that path is blocked.

This is really challenging without knowing the exact grid layout. Given the previous actions were mostly moving right, maybe continuing to move right towards the `is` and `win` rules is the way to go. Alternatively, moving up to reach higher y-axis positions where the rules are located.

Another angle: the `rule `win`` is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can make something WIN by attaching it to this rule, like ""baba is win,"" then I would be the WIN. To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to `baba` and then `win`.

The `baba` rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. Moving right from there would head towards the center, but there are walls. Maybe moving up from `baba`'s position to get closer to the `is` and `win` rules.

Alternatively, since the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, and the `baba` rule is at 8 left and 3 down, the distance is quite large. It might take several moves to reposition the `is` rule.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, perhaps the best immediate action is to keep moving right towards the `is` rule to get closer to the `win` rule and see if I can form the necessary rule. So the chosen action would be ""right.""

Let's try to figure out the next move here. I need to look at the current observation and see what's going on. The active rules are just ""baba is you"", so I'm assuming I'm Baba since that's the usual starting point.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, a door, and several walls. The key is positioned 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 6 steps left and 3 up, which is right next to the key. There's a wall 3 steps to the left and 3 up, blocking the path towards the key and door. Then there are some rules like ""is"", ""win"", and ""wall"" scattered around. 

The goal is usually to reach the win condition, but right now the active rules don't have ""win"" defined as anything. Wait, in previous observations, ""ball is win"" was active, but now it's gone. So maybe the win condition has changed? Or perhaps I need to recreate it by moving rules.

Looking at the rules available: there's a ""rule `is`"" 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule to combine with ""win"" and another object, I could redefine what's win. But how do I move the rules? The tip says I can only move objects or text that aren't ""STOP"" or similar. So ""is"" and ""win"" rules might be movable if they aren't STOPped. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. That might be preventing some movement. But the rules themselves, like ""is"" and ""win"", are likely movable. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move around as Baba.

The key is next to the door, but there's a wall blocking the direct path. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can move ""is"" next to ""win"" and another object, like ""door"", then ""door is win"" would make the door the win condition. Then I could push the door open or go through it.

But how to get there? The key is 7 steps left and 3 up. If I go left, but there are walls. Wait, the wall at 3 steps left and 3 up is blocking the path towards the key. If I can move that wall, but the rule says ""wall is stop"", which means it's immovable. So maybe I need to destroy the wall's rule. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 8 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then the wall at 3 steps left and 3 up might become movable or disappear. Alternatively, if I can change the property of the wall to something else, like ""wall is stop"" is a rule, maybe moving that rule would remove the stop property.

But how to move the ""wall"" rule. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 8 steps left and 2 steps up. To get there, I need to move left from my current position, but I'm not sure where I am exactly. Wait, the observation doesn't specify Baba's position. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to navigate. 

Wait, maybe the key is at 7 steps left and 3 up from Baba's position. So if I move left 7 steps and up 3, I reach the key. But there are walls blocking the way. Alternatively, perhaps the door is adjacent to the key, and if I can get the key, maybe that opens the door. But the door is a stop unless ""stop"" is changed.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and another object, like ""baba"", then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition. That way, standing on the ""win"" rule would make me win. 

But how to get to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I move right and up, avoiding walls. Let me see the layout:

- There's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 up. So if I'm somewhere to the right, moving left towards the key and door is blocked. Maybe I need to go around the wall by moving up or down. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""win"" and ""baba"". The ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. So if I move right from there to be next to ""win"" (which is 2 steps right and 3 up), that would place ""is"" next to ""win"". Then, if I can also move ""baba"" next to it, I could create ""baba is win"". 

But how to move the ""is"" rule. Since ""baba is you"", I can move objects that aren't stop. The ""is"" rule is a text block, and there's no rule stating it's stop, so I can move it. So moving right from the ""is"" rule's position (1 step right, 3 up) to the ""win"" rule's position (2 steps right, 3 up) would line them up. Then, if I can add ""baba"" next to it, perhaps by moving the ""baba"" text block. 

But the ""baba"" text block is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe there's a quicker way. Alternatively, if I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""baba"" by rearranging them. 

Alternatively, since the key is near the door, maybe picking up the key allows me to do something. But I don't see a rule that says ""key is you"" or ""key is move"". Without the key, perhaps I can't proceed. 

Another approach: the ""rule `you`"" is at 6 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba"", then ""baba is you"" would still be active, but maybe combining it with another rule. 

Wait, the active rule is only ""baba is you"". All other rules are potential to be moved. So perhaps the solution is to create a new rule like ""door is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""door"". The ""door"" is at 6 steps left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. So if I move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be next to the ""win"" rule. Then, if I can move the ""door"" rule next to them, but the ""door"" is at 6 steps left, which is far away. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""key"" is necessary to unlock something. If I can get the key (7 steps left, 3 up), then maybe the door becomes passable. But moving left 7 steps is blocked by walls. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. Let's see: the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be adjacent to ""win"". Then, if there's an object adjacent to ""win"", like ""door"", I could make ""door is win"". But the ""door"" is at 6 steps left, which is not adjacent. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a ""rule `door`"" at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""door"" rule next to ""win"" and ""is"", then ""door is win"" would be created. But moving that rule would require navigating past walls. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and another object (like door or baba) to create a new rule.
2. If I can make ""door is win"", then reaching the door would win the level.
3. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to both ""win"" and ""door"".
4. However, the positions are such that ""door"" is far from ""win"", so this might not be feasible.
5. Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""baba"".
6. The ""baba"" text block is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, which is quite far. Moving it to near ""win"" and ""is"" would be difficult.
7. Another idea: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the door if it's not a stop. But the door is a stop if ""stop"" is active. There's a ""rule `stop`"" at 6 steps left and 2 steps up, which might apply to the door.
8. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the door, then it becomes passable. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away or create a rule that negates it.
9. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. Moving it away would require going left and down, but there are walls.
10. Alternatively, create a rule like ""door is not stop"" by moving relevant rules, but I don't have a ""not"" rule here.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the ""win"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 up, avoiding walls. Let's see the path:

From my current position (unknown), but assuming I need to go right 2 steps and up 3. But there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 up. Wait, directions are relative. If the ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up from my position, and there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 up, that would mean the wall is to the left of my position. So moving right towards the ""win"" rule would avoid the wall. 

Wait, the wall is at 3 steps left and 3 up. If I'm at position (0,0), the wall is at (-3,3). The ""win"" rule is at (2,3). So the path from (0,0) to (2,3) would go through (-3,3) which is the wall. But that's not the case. Maybe the coordinates are different. 

I think I'm getting confused without knowing my exact position. Let's try another approach. The key is at 7 steps left and 3 up. The door is at 6 steps left and 3 up. The wall is at 3 steps left and 3 up. So if I'm positioned somewhere between them, moving left would go towards the key and door, but the wall is at 3 steps left. So maybe I'm to the right of the wall. 

If I move left, I hit the wall at 3 steps left. So I need to go around it. Maybe up or down. If I move up, there's a wall at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. That's still blocking. If I move down, maybe there's a path. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that ""is"" to be next to ""win"" (which is 2 steps right and 3 up), then I can add another object. For example, if there's a ""baba"" nearby, I could make ""baba is win"". 

But the ""baba"" text block is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, which is far away. Maybe instead, use the ""door"" which is at 6 steps left and 3 up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""door"", then ""door is win"" would be created. 

The ""door"" is at 6 steps left, which is left of the ""win"" rule at 2 steps right. So they're not adjacent. Therefore, this might not be possible. 

Another angle: the ""key"" is near the door. If I can get the key, maybe it allows me to interact with the door. But how? There's no rule about keys unless I create one. For example, ""key is unlock"", but I don't have that rule. 

Alternatively, if I can push the door by moving it. Since doors are usually pushable unless they're stop. The door is a stop because of the ""stop"" rule at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. To push the door, I need to remove the stop property. 

To do that, I might need to move the ""stop"" rule away or create a rule that says ""door is not stop"". But ""not"" isn't a standard rule in Baba Is You, so maybe that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if I can destroy the ""stop"" rule by moving it off the screen or away from the door. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move it to a different position, then the door might no longer be stop. 

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule away from the door.
2. Then the door is no longer stop, so I can push it.
3. Push the door to open it and reach the other side, which might have the win condition.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. It's at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. To move it, I need to navigate there. From my current position, assuming I'm somewhere near the ""baba"" text block at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, moving right and up might be the way. 

Wait, the ""baba"" text block is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. If I'm standing on that, then moving right would take me towards the center. But there are walls at 3 steps left and 3 up. So maybe I'm positioned at 8 steps left and 3 steps down (the ""baba"" rule's position). 

If I move right from there, I go to 7 steps left, which is where the key is. But there's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 up, which is not in the same row. 

Alternatively, moving up from the ""baba"" position (8 left, 3 down) would be 8 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 3 left and 2 up, which is different. 

This is really confusing without knowing exact positions. Maybe the best action is to move towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up, to combine it with ""win"" and create a new rule. So moving right would get me closer to the ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, since the last few actions were ""right"" and the system kept failing, maybe I need to try a different direction. Perhaps ""up"" to reach the ""win"" rule directly. 

But given the previous failures, maybe the correct action is to move right towards the ""is"" rule to set up a new rule. Let's try that.

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact as Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, which I think is the door or ball. Looking at the objects, there's a key, door, and ball. The ball is labeled as win, but in the current observation, the active rules don't include ""ball is win"" anymore. The last time ball was win, the assistant kept moving right, but maybe that changed.

Wait, the current active rules only have ""baba is you."" So I need to figure out where the win condition is now. If the ball was previously the win, but the rules have changed, maybe I need to recreate that rule. The available rules on the map include ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" and ""stop."" So to make ball win again, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""ball.""

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The ""ball"" is at 1 step up. So if I can move the ""win"" rule down to be near the ""ball,"" that would make ""ball is win"" again. But how do I move the rules? I need to check if the objects I can move are not stopped. The ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" and ""stop"" rules might be movable unless they are defined as stop. The current active rules don't have any stop properties on them, so I can probably move them.

So the plan is: move the ""win"" rule (which is 2 steps right and 3 steps up) towards the ""ball"" (1 step up). Let's see the positions. The ""win"" rule is at (2 right, 3 up), and the ""ball"" is at (1 up). To get the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball,"" I need to move it down two steps. But how? Each move is one step in a direction. So from the ""win"" rule's position, I can move down once to get to 2 right and 2 up, then again to 2 right and 1 up. Then place it next to the ball, which is at 1 up. But the ball is at 1 step up, so maybe the ""win"" rule needs to be adjacent to it. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""ball"" is at 1 step up, but where exactly? Let me check the objects again. The ""ball"" is listed as 1 step up, but no left or right steps mentioned. Assuming it's directly above or below something. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to the ""ball,"" then ""ball is win"" would be active again. 

But first, I need to move myself (Baba) to the position where I can interact with the ""win"" rule. The current position of Baba isn't clear from the observation, but there's a rule `baba` at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. So Baba is there. To get to the ""win"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, I need to move from Baba's position. Let's calculate the direction. Baba is at 8 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up. So relative to Baba, the ""win"" rule is to the right (since Baba is 8 left, adding 2 steps right would make it 6 left, which is still left of center?), but maybe the coordinate system is different. Alternatively, the steps are absolute positions. This might be confusing without a map layout.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on moving the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball."" The ""ball"" is at 1 step up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. So moving the ""win"" rule down two steps each time. Each move is one step down. So first, move down from (2R, 3U) to (2R, 2U), then to (2R, 1U). Once it's at 2R, 1U, it's adjacent to the ""ball"" at 1U (assuming they are in the same column). Then ""win"" next to ""ball"" would make ""ball is win"" active. 

But how do I move the ""win"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by walls. Looking at the objects, there are walls at certain positions. For example, wall 3 step to the left and 3 step up. So moving down from the ""win"" rule might be possible if there's no wall in the way. 

The path from ""win"" at (2R, 3U) to (2R, 1U) would require moving down twice. Let's check if there are walls along that path. At 2R, 3U is the ""win"" rule. Down one step to 2R, 2U: is there a wall? The objects list a wall at 8 left and 2 up, and others, but at 2R, 2U, I don't see a wall mentioned. So probably can move down. Then again to 2R, 1U. At 1U, there's a ""ball"" and a ""door"" at 1 step right and 1 step up. So moving down to 2R, 1U should be possible. 

Once the ""win"" rule is at 2R, 1U adjacent to the ""ball"" at 1U, then ""ball is win"" would be active, allowing me to push the ball to the win condition. But I need to first move the ""win"" rule there. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move the ""is"" rule to combine with ""win"" and ""ball."" The ""is"" rule is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up initially, but in the current observation, the ""is"" rules are at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the right and 3 step up, and another at 5 step to the left. 

Wait, in the current observation, the ""is"" rules are:

- 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- 5 step to the left
- 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- 7 step to the left and 3 steps down

So perhaps I need to use the ""is"" rule that's at 1 step right and 3 step up to create a new rule. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball"" using an ""is"" rule, that would work. 

But first, I need to get the ""is"" rule near the ""win"" and ""ball."" Let's see. The ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 step up is adjacent to the ""win"" rule at 2 steps right and 3 step up. If I move the ""is"" rule one step right, it would be at 2 steps right and 3 step up, next to the ""win"" rule. Then I could place the ""ball"" next to them. But where is the ""ball""? It's at 1 step up. So maybe this approach isn't direct. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at 5 step to the left. If I can move that ""is"" rule to be between ""ball"" and ""win,"" that could work. But moving the ""is"" rule would require being adjacent to it. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the ""win"" rule and try to place it next to the ""ball."" Since the assistant has been moving right previously, maybe continuing right will get closer. But in the last few observations, moving right didn't solve it, leading to defaults. 

Alternatively, check if the door is the win condition now. If the door is win, then I need to reach it. But how? The door is at 6 step left and 3 step up. There's a wall at 3 step left and 3 step up, so maybe I need to move around it. But with ""baba is you,"" I can push objects if they're not stopped. Wait, the rules don't mention pushability, but in Baba Is You, you can push objects that aren't STOP. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 6 step left and 2 step up. So maybe the wall at 3 step left and 3 step up is STOP? The rule `stop` is at 6 step left and 2 step up, which might not be adjacent. 

Alternatively, the path to the door is blocked by walls. The door is at 6 left, 3 up. There's a wall at 3 left, 3 up, and others. So maybe I need to move the wall or change the rules. 

Since the main issue is the win condition, and the ball's rule was removed, the key is to restore it or find another win. If I can't reach the door, maybe the win is elsewhere. 

Alternatively, create a new win rule. For example, make ""baba is win"" by placing ""win"" next to ""baba."" But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I make ""baba is win,"" then I would be both you and win, allowing me to touch win. 

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba."" The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Baba is at 8 step left and 3 steps down. So the distance is quite big. Maybe moving right multiple times to get closer. 

But in previous steps, moving right didn't resolve it. Maybe need a different approach. 

Another idea: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the key to reach a hidden area, but the key is at 7 left, 3 up. Not sure. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create ""key is win,"" but that requires moving the ""win"" rule next to ""key."" The key is at 7 left, 3 up, and ""win"" is at 2 right, 3 up. So moving ""win"" all the way left to be next to the key. But that would take many moves. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""win"" rule down to the ball's location. The ball is at 1 step up. So moving the ""win"" rule down two steps each time. Each move is one step down. From its current position at 2 right, 3 up, move down to 2 right, 2 up, then to 2 right, 1 up. Once there, place it next to the ball. 

But how to move the ""win"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. Assuming I can move the ""win"" rule since it's not stopped. So the action would be to move down twice. But each action is a single step. So first, move down from the ""win"" rule's position. But the assistant's current position isn't specified, but Baba's position is at 8 left, 3 down. To reach the ""win"" rule at 2 right, 3 up, I need to move right 10 steps and up 6 steps, which is a lot. That's not practical. 

Perhaps the correct approach is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""ball."" For example, take the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 step up, move it right to be next to ""win,"" then place ""ball"" next to them. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 1R, 3U.
2. Move right to 2R, 3U (adjacent to ""win"").
3. Then move down to 2R, 2U, then to 2R, 1U to get next to the ball.
4. Place the ""is"" rule between ""win"" and ""ball"" to make ""ball is win.""

But how to execute this movement? Each action is a single step. So the assistant needs to navigate to the ""is"" rule, move it into position, then move the ""win"" rule. 

This is getting quite complex. Given the previous failures, maybe the simplest valid action is to keep moving right towards the ""win"" rule, hoping to get close enough to manipulate it. Alternatively, move down towards the ball's location. 

Looking at the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 2R, 3U. The ball is at 1U. If I could move the ""win"" rule down two steps, that would position it next to the ball. To do that, the action would be to move the ""win"" rule down. But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. 

Assuming the assistant is adjacent to the ""win"" rule, the action would be ""down."" But if not, the assistant needs to move closer. 

Given that the previous actions were ""right"" and led to defaults, maybe the assistant isn't in the right position. Perhaps the correct action is to move down towards the ball's location. 

Alternatively, check if there's a ""you"" rule that can be changed. The ""you"" rule is at 6 step left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba"" the you, but the active rule is already ""baba is you."" 

In summary, the most likely solution is to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""ball"" using an ""is"" rule. To do that, the assistant needs to:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule next to ""win.""
3. Move the ""win"" rule next to ""ball.""
4. Combine them to make ""ball is win.""

However, each of these steps requires multiple actions and navigating around obstacles. Given the limited observation and the need for a single action, the best immediate action is to move towards the ""win"" rule or the ""ball"" to facilitate rule manipulation. 

Considering the previous attempts and the lack of success, maybe moving down from the current position to reach the ball's area. Alternatively, move right to get closer to the ""is"" rule. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. The safest valid action, given the previous pattern, might be to continue moving right in the hope of reaching the necessary rules. However, since that didn't work before, perhaps a different direction is needed. 

Alternatively, move down to get closer to the ball. The ball is at 1 step up, so moving down from the current position (assuming Baba is at 8 left, 3 down) would move to 3 down, which is closer to 1 up. 

Wait, the movement directions are relative. If the ball is 1 step up from Baba's current position (8 left, 3 down), then moving up would bring Baba to 3 down + 1 = 4 down? No, movement directions might be absolute. This is getting too ambiguous without a visual map. 

Given the time constraints and the need to provide an action, I'll settle on moving down to get closer to the ball and the ""win"" rule.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you"", so I'm controlling Baba. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but right now, the active rules don't specify what's win. Looking back at previous observations, there was a ""ball is win"" rule, but in the current observation, that rule is gone. So maybe the win condition has changed?

The objects on the map include a key, a door, walls, and some rules. The key is at 7 steps left and 4 steps up. The door is at 6 left and 4 up. There's a wall at 3 left and 4 up. There are rules like ""is"" and ""win"" positioned to the right at 4 steps up. Also, there's a rule `ball` 2 steps up, `is` at 1 right and 1 up, and `win` at 2 right and 1 up.

Hmm, maybe I need to manipulate the rules again. The ""is"" rule is to the right, so perhaps I can move it to create a new rule. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" rule isn't stopped, so I can move it. If I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" or ""win"" rule, I can create a new rule like ""ball is win"" again, restoring the win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can make myself ""win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""baba"".

Looking at the current positions: the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. The `ball` is at 2 step up, but there's a wall at 3 left and 4 up. Wait, the key is at 7 left and 4 up, which is further left. The door is at 6 left and 4 up. The `win` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The `baba` rule is at 8 left and 2 steps down.

So, if I can reach the `is` rule at 1 right and 4 up, maybe I can move it down to where the `win` rule is at 2 right and 1 up. But how? My position isn't clear here. Wait, the observation shows that the player (Baba) is at 8 left and 3 steps down, based on the `baba` rule's position. So I'm at 8 left, 3 down. The `is` rule is at 1 right and 4 up relative to something? Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the `key` to get past the walls. The key is at 7 left and 4 up. If I can pick up the key and use it to unlock the door, but the door is at 6 left and 4 up, which is adjacent to a wall. If I have the key, maybe I can move the door rule or something. But I don't know if having the key changes anything yet.

Another approach: since the active rules only have ""baba is you"", and no ""win"" rule, maybe the win condition is now something else. Maybe I need to create a rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the `is` next to `baba`. The `baba` rule is at 8 left and 3 steps down. The `is` rule is at 1 right and 4 up. So relative positions might be tricky. Maybe moving down to get closer?

Wait, the latest observation shows that after moving down, the key is now at 7 left and 4 up, door at 6 left and 4 up. The `is` rule is at 1 right and 4 up. So if I move right from my current position (8 left, 3 down) towards the `is` rule, which is at 1 right and 4 up. Wait, directions might be relative. Maybe I need to adjust my coordinate understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the best move is to move towards the `is` rule to create a new rule. Since I'm Baba, and I can move right, left, up, or down. If I move right from my current position, I can get closer to the `is` rule at 1 step right and 4 up. But how does the positioning work? Maybe each step moves one unit in the specified direction.

In the previous steps, moving right multiple times got me closer to the `is` rule. Now, in the latest observation, after moving down, the `is` rule is still at 1 step right and 4 up. So if I'm at 8 left, 3 down, moving right would take me to 7 left, 3 down. Then maybe continue moving right to reach the `is` rule. Once I'm next to the `is` rule, I can potentially move it to attach to another rule, like `win` or `baba`.

Alternatively, the `win` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move the `is` rule there, creating ""win is win"" which might not make sense, or ""something is win"". But I need to see which objects are reachable.

Another angle: the door is at 6 left and 4 up, next to a wall. If I can push the door, but doors are usually stoppable unless a rule says otherwise. Since there's a ""stop"" rule at 6 left and 3 up, maybe doors are stop. But if I can remove the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can move the door. But how?

Alternatively, the key is at 7 left and 4 up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it on the door. But in Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors, but that's only if the door has a ""key"" rule. Currently, there's no ""key is door"" rule, so maybe the key isn't useful yet.

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `key` at 6 steps to the right. So if I can move that `key` rule next to the `door` rule, it would create ""door is key"", allowing me to unlock it. But the `key` rule is at 6 steps to the right, which is probably far from the door at 6 left and 4 up. This is getting complicated.

Let me try to recap. The current active rule is ""baba is you"". The win condition is unclear because the ""ball is win"" rule is no longer present. So I need to create a new win rule. The most straightforward way is to move the `is` rule next to a relevant object. If I can make ""baba is win"", then I can touch Baba (myself) to win. Alternatively, restore ""ball is win"" by moving `is` next to `ball`.

The `ball` is at 2 steps up. The `is` rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. So if I can move down to get the `is` rule near the `ball`, that could work. Alternatively, move the `ball` next to `is`.

But how to move these rules? Since I'm Baba, and I can move right, left, up, or down. Each move would take me one step in that direction, and if I'm adjacent to a text block or object, I can push it if it's not stopped.

Looking at the current positions, the `is` rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up from my current position (8 left, 3 down). So to get to the `is` rule, I need to move left and up. For example, moving left once would take me to 7 left, 3 down. Then up to 7 left, 2 down. Then left again to 6 left, 2 down, etc., but this might take several steps. Alternatively, moving up first.

Wait, maybe my current position is at the `baba` rule, which is at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if the `baba` rule is positioned at 8 left, 2 down, then I (Baba) am at that position. The `is` rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up relative to Baba. So that would place the `is` rule at 8-1=7 left, and 2-4=-2 down. Wait, directions are confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position.

Alternatively, the observation lists objects with their positions relative to something. For example, ""key 7 step to the left and 4 step up"" might mean 7 steps left and 4 up from the reference point, which could be the top-left corner or Baba's position. This is unclear, but perhaps the key is located to the left and up from where I am.

Assuming I need to reach the `is` rule to create a new rule, the best move might be to move right and up towards it. But in the previous steps, moving right multiple times got closer to the `is` rule. Now, after moving down once, the `is` rule is still at 1 step right and 4 up. So perhaps moving right and up would get me there.

Alternatively, since the `win` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, maybe moving the `is` rule there to create ""something is win"". If I can move `is` next to `win`, then whatever is adjacent would become win. But I need to see if that's possible.

Another possibility: since the `key` is nearby, maybe picking it up and using it to modify rules. But I'm not sure how keys work in this specific level without more information.

In the previous attempts, moving right multiple times got me closer to the `is` rule. Now, the latest observation shows that after moving down, the `is` rule is still at 1 right and 4 up. So perhaps moving right again would get me next to the `is` rule, allowing me to move it to attach to another object, like `win` or `baba`.

So the best action might be to move right towards the `is` rule, then once adjacent, push it to the desired position. But the output requires a single action, not multiple steps. So the next immediate action should be to move right to get closer.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the environment since I'm Baba. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but the rules might have changed that. Looking at the objects, there's a key, a door, and several walls. The key is positioned quite far to the left and up, while the door is slightly less so. There's a rule `win` located at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Maybe that's the target, but there's a wall blocking the path.

The rule `is` is at 4 steps up. Since I can move text blocks, perhaps I can rearrange the rules to change the behavior. For example, if I can make the door a STOP, then maybe I can move past it. Alternatively, changing ""win"" to something else might lead to a different goal. The ball is labeled as win, but in earlier observations, that might have changed. Wait, in previous steps, the ball was win, but now the active rules only show ""baba is you."" 

Looking at the current objects, the rule `win` is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. To reach there, I need to move up and right, but there's a wall at 4 steps up. Maybe I can move the `win` rule closer or break the wall. Since walls are defined by `wall is stop` or similar, perhaps moving the `wall` rule away would make the path clear. 

The `is` rule is at 4 steps up. If I can move that `is` rule next to the `win` rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""something IS win."" For instance, if I move the `is` to be next to `key`, then ""key IS win"" would make the key the win condition. That might be a better path since the key is closer. Alternatively, moving `is` next to `baba` could change ""baba IS win,"" making me the win condition. 

But first, I need to navigate to the `is` rule. The current position of the rule `is` is at 4 steps up. The player (Baba) is at 8 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So, to get to the `is` rule at 4 steps up, I need to move up and adjust left or right. Let's see the coordinates. Suppose the player is at position (0,0). The `is` rule is at (0,4). The `win` rule is at (1,4). The wall is at (-4,4). So, moving up from the player's position (0,-2) to (0,4) requires moving up four steps. But there's a wall at (-4,4), which is a stop. However, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move past stop objects unless they're defined as STOP. Wait, the wall's rule is at (9,-3) perhaps? Wait, no, looking at the objects:

rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 3 step up. So that's at (-9,3). The wall at 4 step to the left and 4 step up is at (-4,4). The rule `stop` is at 6 step to the left and 3 step up, which is (-6,3). So the wall at (-4,4) is a `wall` object, and its rule is `wall IS stop`? Not sure. But since I'm Baba, maybe I can push past it if it's not directly in the path. 

But the immediate goal is to reach the `is` rule at (0,4). The player is at (0,-2). So moving up three steps to get to (0,1), then (0,2), (0,3), (0,4). Along the way, are there any obstacles? There's a wall at (-4,4), but that's to the left. The player is moving straight up. However, the `door` is at (-7,4), which might be a stop if there's a rule for it. The `door` rule is at (2,-1), so maybe ""door IS stop"" is not active. Since the active rules are only ""baba is you,"" maybe doors are passable. 

But moving up, the player would pass through the area where there's a `win` rule at (1,4). If the player reaches there, but there's a wall at (-4,4), but the player is moving from (0,-2) to (0,4), so they'd go through (0,4), which is where the `win` rule is. But the `win` rule's position is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up from the player's current position? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 8 steps to the left and 4 steps up, which would be (-8,4). The door is at (-7,4). The `win` rule is at (1,4), which is to the right. So the path to `win` is blocked by the wall at (-4,4). To get around that, maybe I need to move the `wall` rule or change its property. 

Another approach: Since the `is` rule is at (4 steps up), if I can move it next to the `key`, then creating ""key IS win"" would make the key the win condition. The key is at (-8,4), and the `is` rule is at (0,4). So the player needs to move right to reach the `is` rule, then move left to get next to the key. 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move up from (0,-2) to (0,4) to reach the `is` rule.
2. Once at (0,4), move left to get next to the key at (-8,4). But wait, the key is 8 steps to the left, so that's (-8,4). The `is` rule is at (0,4). So moving left 8 steps from (0,4) would reach the key. But that's a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, move the `is` rule next to the key. To do that, the player needs to pick up the `is` rule (if possible) and move it. Since the player is Baba and ""baba is you,"" they can move text blocks that are not STOP. The `is` rule is at (0,4). The player is at (0,-2). So moving up to (0,4), then left to (0,4) to (-8,4). But that's 8 steps left. Alternatively, maybe the `is` rule is at 4 steps up, so the player needs to move up 4 steps. 

Once the `is` rule is next to the key, create ""key IS win"" by placing `key`, `is`, `win` in sequence. Then the key becomes the win condition, which is closer. 

But how to move the `is` rule? The player needs to move right or left while carrying the `is` rule. 

Alternatively, move the `win` rule to be next to Baba. If the `win` rule is at (1,4), and the player is at (0,-2), moving up to (0,4), then right to (1,4) where the `win` rule is. Then, create a new rule like ""baba IS win"" by moving `baba`, `is`, `win` together. Since the rule `baba` is at (9,-3), which is far away. So that might not be feasible. 

Another angle: The door is at (-7,4). If I can make the door not a stop, then I can go through it. But the `door` rule is at (2,-1), so unless I move that, the door's property remains as per existing rules. Since the active rules are only ""baba is you,"" and there's a rule `door` at (2,-1), but no specific property for door, maybe doors are passable. 

Wait, the rule `door` is an object, but without a property, maybe it's just a door. If I can push the door out of the way, but doors are usually STOP. Wait, the rule `stop` is at (-6,3), which is a separate object. So unless there's a rule like ""door IS stop,"" the door might not be stop. 

In this current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" So doors might be passable. So maybe I can move past the door at (-7,4) by moving left. But the key is at (-8,4), and the `win` rule is at (1,4). 

Alternatively, the goal might still be the original `win` at (1,4), but there's a wall at (-4,4). To get past the wall, I need to remove the `wall` rule or change it. The `wall` rule is at (-9,3), which is a text block saying ""wall IS ..."". To change the wall's property, I need to move the `wall` rule text next to a different property. 

For example, if I can move the `wall` rule text next to `stop`, then ""wall IS stop"" becomes inactive, and maybe ""wall IS something else."" But the `stop` rule is at (-6,3). So the player would need to navigate to that area. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Active rule: baba is you.
- Objects: key far left, door left, win right up, several walls.
- Rules: is at 4 up, win at 1 right 4 up, wall rule at left 9 up 3, stop rule at left 6 up 3.

Possible actions:

1. Move to the `is` rule at 4 up, then rearrange it to create a new rule that makes key or Baba the win.
2. Move to the `stop` rule and change it, removing the STOP property from walls.
3. Push past walls since I'm Baba (but are walls stop? If not, maybe possible).

First, let's try to create a new rule. To make the key the win, need to have ""key IS win"". The key is at (-8,4), `is` is at (0,4), and `win` is at (1,4). So the player needs to move from their current position (0,-2) up to (0,4), then left to (-8,4) to get the key, but that's a long way. Alternatively, carry the `is` rule to the key's location.

Alternatively, move the `is` rule next to the `win` rule. If I can make ""something IS win"", like ""baba IS win"", then touching Baba would win. The `baba` rule is at (9,-3), which is far away. So that's not feasible.

Another idea: The `key` is at (-8,4). If I can pick up the `key` and move it to the `win` location, but keys are usually not moveable unless specified. Since the active rules only have ""baba is you"", and the key's rule is probably not defining it as stop, maybe I can move it. But moving the key to the `win` rule's position (1,4) would make ""key IS win"" if they are adjacent. 

So steps:

1. Move up to (0,4) to get the `is` rule.
2. Move left to (-8,4) where the key is.
3. Place the `is` rule next to the key and the `win` rule to create ""key IS win"".

But this requires precise movement. Alternatively, move the `is` rule to be between the key and the `win` rule.

Alternatively, since the `win` rule is already at (1,4), if I can make ""key IS win"" by placing the key, `is`, `win` in a line.

The player is at (0,-2). Need to move up to (0,4), then left to (-8,4) (key's position), then move right to place the `is` next to key and `win`.

But this might take several steps. The immediate action needed is to move towards the `is` rule. So the first step is to move up.

Looking at the current observation, after moving down previously, the player might have moved to a different position. Wait, in the last few steps, the assistant kept choosing 'right' and 'down', but the observations showed the player's position changing. However, without knowing the exact starting position, it's a bit tricky. But based on the latest observation, the key is at 8 steps to the left and 4 up, door at 7 left and 4 up, wall at 4 left and 4 up. The `is` rule is at 4 up. The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. Assuming the player is near the `baba` rule which is at 9 left and 2 down, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the `baba` object, which is at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down. So ( -8, -3 ). Then the `is` rule is at 4 up, which would be (-8, 1). To get there, move up once. Then, the `win` rule is at 1 right and 4 up, so (-7,4). 

So the plan is:

1. Move up from (-8,-3) to (-8,1) to reach the `is` rule.
2. Then move right to (-7,4) where the `win` is, but there's a wall at (-4,4). Wait, no, the wall is at 4 left and 4 up, which is (-4,4). So the path from (-8,1) to (-7,4) would cross over (-4,4), which is a wall. Unless the wall's rule has been changed.

But since the active rules are only ""baba is you"", and the wall is a `wall` object with the rule `wall IS stop` somewhere else, the player might not be able to pass through it. 

Alternative plan: Change the `wall` rule's property. The `wall` rule is at (-9,3), which is a text block saying ""wall IS ..."". To change it, move the `wall` rule next to a different property. For example, if there's a `stop` rule at (-6,3), moving the `wall` rule next to `stop` would make ""wall IS stop"". But that doesn't help. To make the wall not a stop, need to redefine it. For example, move the `wall` rule next to `you` or another property. 

This is getting too complex. Let's try a simpler approach. The immediate goal is to reach the `win` object. Since it's at (1,4), but blocked by a wall at (-4,4). Maybe the solution is to move the `win` rule to a different location. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba the win. To do that, the player needs to be next to the `baba` text block and the `win` rule. The `baba` rule is at (9,-3), which is far away. So moving there is not feasible.

Another idea: Use the `key` to unlock the door. If the door is a STOP, but if I can make the key unlock it. But there's no rule about keys unlocking doors in the current observations. 

Wait, the rule `key` is at 6 steps to the right, which is (1,0). The door is at (-7,4). So the key is on the opposite side. Maybe pick up the key and bring it to the door. If the door requires a key, but there's no such rule active. 

Given the time I've spent, I think the best immediate action is to move towards the `is` rule to start creating new rules. So the chosen action would be to move up to reach the `is` rule.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but sometimes you have to change the rules to make yourself the WIN or change what's considered the WIN. The active rules here are ""baba is you,"" so I can move any object that isn't stopped, right?

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ball labeled as WIN, but the active rules still say ball is win. Wait, the active rules are just ""baba is you,"" so maybe the ball is still the win condition. But how do I reach it? There's a door in the way. The door is probably a STOP because most doors in Baba Is You are stops unless the rule says otherwise. So I need to move the door out of the way. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `door` somewhere. Let me check the objects again. Oh, there's a rule `door` at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Wait, how do I get to that rule? The positions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the coordinates again. 

The key is at 8 steps left and 4 steps up. The door is at 7 left and 4 up. The rule `is` is at 4 step up. The rule `win` is 1 step right and 4 step up. The rule `door` is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. So if I can move that rule `door`, I can change what the door does. Maybe change door from being a STOP to something else. 

But to move the rule `door`, I need to be adjacent to it and ensure that neither the rule nor the door is stopped. The current active rules don't have anything stopping the `is` or `win` rules. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they're STOP. The rule `door` itself isn't stopped, so I can move it. 

So the plan is: move the `door` rule to a different position to alter its effect. For example, if I can move the `door` rule next to the actual door object, maybe I can change the door's property. Alternatively, create a new rule that makes door not a STOP. 

Wait, the original door is at 7 left and 4 up. The rule `door` is at 4 right and 2 up. So I need to navigate to that rule. Let me see where I am. The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` which is at 9 left and 2 steps down. So I need to move right and down to reach the rule `door`. 

The current active rules are ""baba is you,"" so I can move any object I'm touching unless it's STOP. The rule `is` is at 4 step up. Maybe moving that first? Or move the `door` rule. Let me try to move the `door` rule. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it. The rule `door` is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up from the current position of Baba. 

So from Baba's position at 9 left and 2 steps down, moving right would take me towards the rule `door`. Let's see:

Baba's position: 9 left, 2 down.

Rule `door` is at 4 right and 2 up. Wait, the coordinates might be relative. Maybe I need to calculate the direction. If the rule `door` is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up from Baba's current position, then moving right 4 times and up 2 times. But each action is a single step. So I need to move in the right direction step by step. 

But the previous actions were moving right multiple times, leading to the key being further left. Maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the key is a distraction. The main goal is the ball (WIN). The door is blocking the path to the ball. 

If I can remove the door's STOP property, then the door wouldn't block. To do that, I need to change the rule that makes door a STOP. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 6 left and 3 up. But that's a separate rule. To delete that, I would need to move the `stop` rule away or rewrite it. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""door is not stop."" But to do that, I need to have the `door` and `not stop` text blocks. But I don't see a `not` text block here. Wait, the rules might be using inverse properties. For example, if there's a rule ""rule is stop,"" then moving that rule could help. 

Alternatively, since the current active rules are ""baba is you,"" and the ""door"" is a STOP because of the existing rule `stop` at 6 left and 3 up. So to remove the STOP from door, I need to either move the `stop` rule away or overwrite it. 

But how? Let me check the objects again. There's a rule `stop` at 6 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule, then door might no longer be a STOP. So the plan is: move the `stop` rule to a different location, thus removing its effect on the door. 

But how to get to the `stop` rule. The current position of Baba is at 9 left and 2 steps down. The `stop` rule is at 6 left and 3 up. So from Baba's position, moving left 3 steps and up 1 step. Let's see:

Baba is at 9 left, 2 down.

Move left 3 steps: 9-3=6 left, 2 down.

Then move up 1 step: 6 left, 1 down.

Is there any wall in the way? Looking at the map, wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up. Wait, the walls are at various positions, but 6 left and 1 down might be clear. 

Once I reach the `stop` rule, I can move it. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push it. Then placing it somewhere else, like next to the door, to override the rule. 

Alternatively, move the `stop` rule to the same position as the door, effectively making ""door is not stop."" But I think you have to have the `is` rule involved. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach: use the existing `is` rules to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the `is` rule next to the `door` and `win` or something. 

Wait, there's a rule `win` at 2 steps right and 4 step up. If I can make Baba a WIN by creating ""baba is win,"" that would solve it. To do that, I need to move the `win` text block and the `baba` text block together with an `is` rule. 

Looking at the objects, the `baba` rule is at 9 left and 2 steps down. The `win` rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up. 

So the steps could be:

1. Move the `is` rule next to the `baba` rule and the `win` rule to create ""baba is win.""

But to do that, I need to navigate to where those rules are. 

Alternatively, since the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the `win` rule towards the exit. 

Alternatively, since the ball is the WIN object, maybe I can reach it by moving past the door. If the door is not a STOP, then I can walk through it. 

So the critical point is removing the STOP property from the door. To do that, either remove the `stop` rule or change the door's rule. 

The `stop` rule is at 6 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule away, then the door might no longer be a STOP. 

Let me try to plan the steps:

Current position: Baba at 9 left, 2 down.

Need to reach the `stop` rule at 6 left, 3 up.

Move left 3 steps (from 9 to 6 left), then up 1 step (from 2 down to 1 down).

But along the way, are there any walls? Let's check the walls:

There's a wall at 4 left and 4 up, 6 left and 3 up, etc. Wait, the walls are at various positions, but the path to 6 left and 3 up might be blocked. 

Looking at the objects:

- wall 4 step to the left and 4 step up: that's further left and up.
- wall 6 step to the left and 3 step up: exactly where the `stop` rule is. But the `stop` rule is a text block, not a wall. So maybe the wall is at 6 left and 3 up, but the `stop` rule is also there. Wait, no, each object has its own position. So the `stop` rule is at 6 left and 3 up, separate from the wall? Or is the wall overlapping with the `stop` rule?

This is a bit confusing. The observation lists all objects, including walls and rules. So if there's a wall at 6 left and 3 up, and the `stop` rule is also there, then I can't move into that space because it's a wall. But the `stop` rule is a text block, which can be moved unless it's stopped. 

Wait, the rules say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So if the `stop` rule itself is not stopped, I can move it. Even if there's a wall at the same position, maybe the text block can be moved over the wall? Or do walls block movement entirely? 

In Baba Is You, walls are solid and you can't move through them. So if the path to the `stop` rule is blocked by a wall, I can't get there. 

Looking at the current map:

Objects include:

- wall 4 step to the left and 4 step up
- rule `stop` 6 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 6 step to the left and 3 step up

So the `stop` rule and a wall are both at 6 left and 3 up. That means that position is blocked by a wall, making it impossible to move into. Therefore, I can't reach the `stop` rule to move it. 

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe another approach is needed. 

Let me check the other rules. There's a rule `is` at 3 step up. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the `is` rule next to the `key` and `you`, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the ball is a WIN, maybe I can push the ball towards me. But the ball is at 1 step up. If I can move down to reach it, but there's a wall at 3 step left and 1 step up. 

Wait, the ball is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up from where? The exact positions are a bit hard to visualize without a map, but based on the coordinates:

Baba is at 9 left, 2 down.

The ball is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So from Baba's position, moving left 1 step and up 1 step would reach the ball. But is there a wall in the way?

Looking at the walls:

- wall 4 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 6 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- etc.

So moving left 1 step from 9 left would be 8 left, 2 down. Then up 1 step to 8 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at different positions. Maybe it's clear. 

If I can move to the ball's position, then since the ball is WIN, touching it would win the level. But the path might be blocked by a wall. 

Alternatively, the door is at 7 left and 3 step up. To get to the ball, I need to go through the door. If the door is a STOP, I can't pass through. So I need to make the door not a STOP. 

Another idea: use the existing `is` rule to create a new rule that makes door passable. For example, create ""door is win"" or ""door is you."" But to do that, I need to move the `door` rule and the `is` rule together with another object. 

The `door` rule is at 4 right and 2 up from Baba's position. Let's see:

Baba is at 9 left, 2 down.

The `door` rule is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. So moving right 4 times and up 2 times. 

But each move is one step. So from 9 left, 2 down:

Right 1 → 8 left, 2 down

Right 2 → 7 left, 2 down

Right 3 → 6 left, 2 down

Right 4 → 5 left, 2 down

Now up 2 steps:

Up 1 → 5 left, 1 down

Up 2 → 5 left, 0 down (which is the same as up 2)

At this position, is there the `door` rule? According to the objects, the `door` rule is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up from the original position, which would place it at 5 left, 0 down (since original position is 9 left, 2 down; right 4 is 5 left, and up 2 is 0 down). 

Once I'm at the `door` rule, I can push it. Then place it next to the actual door object to change its property. 

For example, if I move the `door` rule next to the door (which is at 7 left and 3 step up), then combining it with an `is` rule could change what the door does. 

Alternatively, move the `door` rule next to the `win` rule to make ""door is win,"" allowing me to walk through the door. 

This is getting a bit complicated, but let's try to outline the steps:

1. Move from Baba's initial position (9 left, 2 down) to the `door` rule at 5 left, 0 down.

2. Push the `door` rule towards the door object at 7 left, 3 up.

3. Place the `door` rule next to an `is` rule and another object (like `win`) to create ""door is win,"" making the door passable and a WIN.

4. Then navigate through the door to the WIN (ball).

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" by moving the `win` rule next to Baba's text block.

To do that:

1. Find the `win` rule, which is at 1 step right and 4 step up from Baba's position.

2. Move right to reach the `win` rule.

3. Push the `win` rule next to the `baba` text block (which is at 9 left, 2 down) using an `is` rule.

So from Baba's position:

Right 1 → 8 left, 2 down

Right 2 → 7 left, 2 down

Right 3 → 6 left, 2 down

Right 4 → 5 left, 2 down

Up 2 → 5 left, 0 down (reaches the `door` rule)

Wait, the `win` rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up from the original position. So:

Original position: 9 left, 2 down.

1 step right → 8 left, 2 down.

4 step up → 8 left, 2 down - 4 steps up (since down is negative). So 8 left, -2 down (which is 2 up).

Is there a `win` rule there? According to the objects, yes: rule `win` is at 2 steps to the right and 4 step up from the original position. Wait, the observation says:

""rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 1 step down"" in earlier observations, but in the current observation, it's:

Objects on the map include:

rule `win` 1 step to the right and 4 step up.

So current `win` rule is at 1 right, 4 up from Baba's position.

So from 9 left, 2 down:

Right 1 → 8 left, 2 down.

Up 4 steps:

Up 1 → 8 left, 1 down

Up 2 → 8 left, 0 down

Up 3 → 8 left, -1 down (1 up)

Up 4 → 8 left, -2 down (2 up)

At this position, there's the `win` rule. So moving there would allow me to grab the `win` rule.

Once I have the `win` rule, I need to move it next to Baba's text block (rule `baba`) and an `is` rule to create ""baba is win.""

The `baba` rule is at 9 left, 2 down. The `is` rule is at 3 step up from Baba's original position? Let's check:

In the current observation, the `is` rule is at 3 step up. So from Baba's position (9 left, 2 down), moving up 3 steps would place me at 9 left, -1 down (1 up). Is there an `is` rule there?

Yes, looking at the objects:

rule `is` 3 step up.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the `win` rule at 8 left, 2 up.

2. Bring the `win` rule next to the `is` rule at 9 left, 1 up (since 3 step up from 2 down is 9 left, -1 down).

Wait, coordinates are a bit confusing. Let's assume that moving up from 9 left, 2 down:

Up 1 → 9 left, 1 down

Up 2 → 9 left, 0 down

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which might be the ball or the door, but the rules could have changed. Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key positioned at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. The door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up, and there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. There are several rule blocks scattered around. The ""is"" rule is at 3 steps up, ""win"" is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, ""wall"" rule is at 9 left and 2 up, and ""stop"" at 7 left and 2 up. There's also a ball at 1 step left and 1 step up, and another ""is"" rule there. The key is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the current position, I think.

Wait, the player (Baba) is probably at the position of the ""baba"" rule block, which is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. So to move towards the key or the door, I need to navigate around the walls and stop blocks. The ""stop"" rule makes objects immovable, so I can't push past them unless I change the rules.

The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so I can move freely. The key is to the left and up a bit. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block at 3 steps up to combine with ""win"" or something else. Wait, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right of the ""is"" at 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" next to ""win,"" then maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. But how to do that?

Alternatively, the ball is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can make the ball the win by moving the ""win"" rule to be next to the ball. The current ""win"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I move the ""win"" rule down to the ball's position, then the win condition would be the ball. But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to move it step by step, possibly pushing other objects if they're not stop. Let's check the surroundings.

The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. To move it down, I might need to go there and push it. But the path might be blocked. Let me visualize the map. The player (Baba) is at 9 left, 3 down. The ""win"" is at 1 right and 3 up, which would be 8 left, 3 up relative to Baba? Maybe I need to move right first to get closer.

Alternatively, the key is at 8 left, 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe that unlocks something, but I'm not sure. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. To get past the door, I might need to change the door's property, like making it not a stop. But the ""door"" rule is at 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, perhaps to create ""door is stop"" or ""door is not stop,"" but that requires manipulating the rules.

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" There's also a ""stop"" rule at 7 left and 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, maybe doors become passable. But moving the ""stop"" rule would require navigating to it. Let me think about the positions again.

The key is at 8 left, 3 up. The player is at 9 left, 3 down. So to reach the key, I need to move left and up. But there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up. Wait, no—the walls are at varying positions. Let me list all walls:

- wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 4 step to the left and 2 step up
- wall 4 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 4 step to the left
- wall 4 step to the left and 1 step down
- wall 4 step to the left and 2 steps down
- wall 4 step to the left and 3 steps down

So there's a cluster of walls starting at 4 left, going down to 3 down. The player is at 9 left, 3 down. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. So to go left towards the key, the path is blocked by the walls starting at 4 left. So maybe need to go around them. But how?

Alternatively, move up towards the ""is"" rule at 3 step up. If I can get to the ""is"" rule and combine it with another rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""is"" next to the ""win"" rule, then ""win"" becomes a property that can be assigned. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from the ""is"" rule. So if I can move the ""win"" rule left to be adjacent to the ""is,"" then combining them would create a new rule. But the ""win"" is currently 1 step right of the ""is."" So maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule left by one step.

To do that, I would have to move the ""win"" rule, which is a text block. Since the player is at 9 left, 3 down, the ""win"" is at 1 right and 3 up, which is 8 left, 3 up. So the player needs to move up to 3 up, then right to 8 left. But the path there might be blocked. Let's see:

From player's position (9 left, 3 down), moving up to 3 up would be 9 left, 0. Then right to 8 left, 0. But between 9 left and 8 left, there's a wall at 4 left, which is way to the left. So unless there's a path around, this might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe moving through other directions.

Wait, the player is at 9 left, 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 3 step up, which is 9 left, 0. So moving up from 3 down to 0 (3 up) gets to the ""is"" rule. Then from there, move right to reach the ""win"" rule at 1 step right. So the player needs to go up, then right.

But to move up from 3 down to 3 up (position 9 left, 0), is that possible? The path up would require moving through the cells above. Are there walls in the way? Looking at the walls:

- wall at 4 left, 3 up (which is 4 left, 0 relative to the player's starting position? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. Wait, the observation says ""objects on the map"" with positions relative to the player? Or absolute? The problem is that the coordinate system isn't clear. Maybe the positions are relative to the player's current position. For example, ""1 step to the left"" means left relative to the player.

Assuming that, the player is at (0,0). Then ""key 7 step to the left and 3 step up"" would be at (-7, 3). The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is at (0, 3). The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 step up, which is (1, 3). The ""baba"" rule is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is (-9, -3).

So the player needs to move from (-9, -3) to, say, the ""win"" rule at (1,3). But there are walls in the way. The walls are at:

- wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up: (-4, 3)
- wall 4 step to the left and 2 step up: (-4, 2)
- wall 4 step to the left and 1 step up: (-4, 1)
- wall 4 step to the left: (-4, 0)
- wall 4 step to the left and 1 step down: (-4, -1)
- etc.

So between the player at (-9,-3) and the ""win"" at (1,3), there's a big block of walls starting at (-4, -3) going up to (-4,3). That's a vertical wall at x=-4 from y=-3 to y=3. So the player can't go around that on the left side.

On the right side, from x=0 upwards, there's the ""is"" at (0,3), ""win"" at (1,3). To get there, the player would need to move right through x=-1, -2, etc., but the path might be blocked. Let's check:

From the player's position (-9,-3), moving right towards x=-8, -7, etc., until x=0. Are there walls in that path?

At y=-3 (the player's level), there's a wall at x=-4, y=-3. So when moving right from x=-9 to x=-4, there's a wall at x=-4, so the player can't go past that. Therefore, the player is blocked on the right side by the wall at x=-4, y=-3 and above.

So maybe the only way is to go around the wall at x=-4 by moving up or down. But moving up from y=-3 to y=0, the player can go around the wall. Let's see:

Player is at (-9,-3). Move up to (-9, -2), (-9, -1), (-9, 0). Then move right towards x=-8, etc., but there's a wall at x=-4, y=0. So even moving up, the wall at x=-4 blocks the path.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules instead of trying to move through the walls.

The key is at (-7,3). To get there, the player would need to move left and up, but the wall at x=-4 blocks movement to the right. Wait, the key is at x=-7, y=3. From the player's position (-9,-3), moving left would go further left, which is towards x=-10, etc. That's not helpful. Moving up to y=3 would require avoiding the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to change the ""wall"" rule so that walls are passable. The ""wall"" rule is at (-9,2). If I can move that rule, perhaps to create a rule like ""wall is stop"" or remove it. But how?

The ""wall"" rule is at (-9,2). To move it, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it. The player is at (-9,-3). To reach (-9,2), the player needs to move up 5 steps. Let's see if that's possible.

From (-9,-3), move up to (-9,-2), (-9,-1), (-9,0), (-9,1), (-9,2). But along the way, at y=0, there's a wall at (-4,0), which is not on the same x. So moving straight up along x=-9 is possible until y=2, where the ""wall"" rule is. So the player can move up to (-9,2), then take the ""wall"" rule and move it somewhere else.

Once the ""wall"" rule is moved, maybe walls become non-stop, allowing the player to pass through. Then the player can navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba a win. Since the current active rule is ""baba is you,"" if the player can make ""baba is win,"" then reaching any Baba (which is the player) would satisfy the win condition. To do that, the player needs to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and combine them.

The ""is"" rule is at (0,3), and the ""win"" rule is at (1,3). So the player needs to move the ""win"" rule left to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule. To do that, the player needs to be next to the ""win"" rule and push it left.

But the player is at (-9,-3). How to get to (1,3)? It's a long way around the walls. Maybe the key is to first move the ""wall"" rule out of the way, then find a path.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something. If the key is at (-7,3), and there's a door at (-8,3), maybe using the key on the door. But to do that, the player needs to reach the door and the key. However, the door's rule is at (2,2), which is the ""door"" text block. If the door is a stop, the player can't pass through it. But if the player can change the door's property to not stop, then they can go through.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Move the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2) to somewhere else, perhaps below, so that walls don't block the path.
2. Navigate around the now-passable walls to reach the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.
3. Combine them to create ""baba is win,"" making the player the win condition.

To move the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2), the player needs to move there. From (-9,-3), move up to (-9,2). That's 5 steps up. Then, take the ""wall"" rule and move it down, say to (-9,1). Now, the wall rule is no longer at (-4, y), so the vertical wall at x=-4 is removed.

Once the wall rule is moved, the player can move right past x=-4. Then, proceed to the ""is"" rule at (0,3) and ""win"" at (1,3). Move the ""win"" rule left to (0,3), combining with ""is"" to make ""baba is win.""

But how to execute these steps? The player needs to:

- Move up from (-9,-3) to (-9,2) (5 up actions).
- Grab the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2) and move it down to, say, (-9,1) (down action).
- Now, navigate right from (-9,1) towards (0,3). This would require moving right 9 steps and up 2 steps. But there might be other obstacles.

Alternatively, after removing the wall rule, the player can go around the blockage at x=-4.

This seems like a viable path. So the first action would be to move up to reach the ""wall"" rule, then move it down. But the problem is the number of steps required and ensuring that the player can move freely.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path by moving the ""is"" rule next to ""win."" Let's see:

The ""is"" rule is at (0,3). The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). To move the ""win"" rule left to (0,3), the player needs to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule and push it left. But the player is at (-9,-3), so how to get there?

It's a long way, but possible if the walls are removed. So the priority is to move the ""wall"" rule first.

So step-by-step:

1. Move up from (-9,-3) to (-9,2) (5 up actions).
2. Take the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2) and move it down to (-9,1) (down action).
3. Now, navigate right to (0,3). From (-9,1), move right 9 times to (0,1), then up 2 times to (0,3).
4. Once at (0,3), move left to the ""win"" rule at (1,3) (left action), then push it left to (0,3) to create ""baba is win.""

This would make the player the win condition. Then, the game is won by staying in place, as ""baba is win.""

So the actions needed are:

Up (5 times), down, right (9 times), up (2 times), left, left.

But the system requires choosing a single action per observation. So in each step, the agent can only perform one action. Given that the previous actions were ""right"" and ""up,"" but they led to defaulting to idle, maybe the agent is getting stuck in a loop.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action now is to move up to reach the ""is"" rule. But given the previous failed attempts, perhaps the immediate action should be to move up to get closer to the relevant rules.

Alternatively, since the last observation had the player at (-9,-3) and the ""win"" rule at (1,3), maybe the best immediate action is to move up to start ascending towards the rules.

But given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action is to move up once to get closer.

Let's try to figure this out. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but sometimes the rules change that. Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key located 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 7 steps left and 3 up. There are a bunch of walls and some rules scattered around. The rule `win` is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So if I can get to that `win` rule, maybe that's the win condition. But how?

Wait, the `win` rule is positioned at 1 step right and 3 up from where I currently am. But there are walls blocking the way. Let me see the layout more clearly. The walls are at positions like 4 steps left and 3 up, which might form a barrier. The `is` rule is at 3 steps up, which could be used to create new rules.

Hmm, maybe I need to move the `win` rule closer or change the win condition. Alternatively, perhaps moving the `key` to reach the door? But the key is 8 steps left and 3 up, which is pretty far. Maybe I should focus on moving the `is` rules to form new rules. For example, if I can combine `baba` with `win`, then I could become the win condition. Let me check if there's a `baba` text block nearby. Oh, there's a rule `baba` at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's pretty far. Maybe I can move the `is` rule next to the `baba` text block to create ""baba is win"".

But how do I move the `is` rule? The rule `is` is at 3 steps up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and it shouldn't be stopped. Looking at the objects, the `is` rule at 3 steps up is next to a wall (4 steps left and 3 up), but maybe there's a way around. Wait, the wall is at 4 steps left and 3 up, but the `is` rule is 1 step right from there. So if I can move right towards the `is` rule, but there's a wall blocking the path. Maybe I need to push the wall? But walls are usually stop properties unless there's a rule saying otherwise. The current rules are only ""baba is you,"" so walls are stop. So I can't move through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move other rules to rearrange them. The `win` rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that towards the `baba` text block, then combine them with an `is` rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me see the positions again.

The `is` rule is at 3 steps up. The `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 up, so they are adjacent horizontally. If I can move the `is` rule to the left or right to connect with `baba` and `win`, that could create a new rule. But I need to be able to move the `is` rule. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The `is` rule isn't stopped, so I can move it.

So the plan is: move the `is` rule next to the `baba` text block (which is at 9 left, 3 down) and the `win` rule (1 right, 3 up) to form ""baba is win"". But the positions are quite far. Let's see the steps needed.

First, from my current position (assuming I'm at the original Baba's location, which might be inferred from the rules). The `baba` rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, but the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I must be the Baba object. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 9 left, 3 down. That's likely the Baba text block, and I'm adjacent to it? Or maybe I'm at the position of the Baba entity. Hmm, the observation doesn't explicitly state where the player is, only the positions of objects and rules. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe I need to assume that the player is at a certain point, perhaps near the `baba` rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is inferred by the relative positions of the objects. This is tricky without knowing the exact grid layout. But given the actions previously taken were moving right, up, etc., maybe the player is moving towards the `is` rules to manipulate them.

Another angle: the original win condition was ""ball is win,"" but that's no longer active. Now the only active rule is ""baba is you."" So the goal might be to reach a `win` object, which is now a rule. The `win` rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move to that position, but it's blocked by walls. Let me check the path from where I am to the `win` rule.

Assuming I'm at a position where moving up 3 steps gets me to the `win` rule's location, but there are walls in between. For example, if the `win` rule is at (x, y), and I need to go through positions (x, y+1), (x, y+2), etc., but there are walls blocking. In the current observation, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 up, which is directly below the `win` rule (which is 1 step right from there). So the path to `win` is blocked by that wall.

Therefore, to reach the `win` rule, I need to move the wall or remove the block. But walls are stop, so I can't push them unless there's a rule allowing it. Since the only rule is ""baba is you,"" I can't move walls. So that approach is stuck.

Alternative idea: Change the win condition. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the `win` rule would make me win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"" by placing the `baba` text block, `is`, and `win` text block together.

Looking at the objects, the `baba` text block is at 9 left, 3 down. The `win` rule is at 1 right, 3 up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up. So the positions are quite far apart. Maybe I need to move the `is` rule closer to the `baba` and `win` text blocks.

To move the `is` rule at 3 step up, I can move up or down. If I move up from the `is` rule's position (3 step up), but where am I currently? If the `is` rule is 3 steps up from my current position, moving up would get me there. But I need to know my position. This is getting complicated without a visual grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the best move is to continue moving right to reach the `is` rule at 3 step up, then move it next to the `baba` text block. But previous attempts to move right might have brought me closer. For example, in earlier observations, moving right incremented the step counts, suggesting movement towards the right direction.

Given the lack of a visual map, I'll have to proceed based on relative positions. The latest observation shows that after moving right multiple times, the key, door, and other objects have shifted further left. The `is` rule is now at 3 step up, and the `win` rule is 1 step right from there. The `baba` text block is far to the left and down.

Perhaps the optimal action is to move up towards the `is` rule at 3 step up, then move it left or right to connect with `baba` and `win`. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the `is` rule. If I move up once, I'd be at the `is` rule's location, then I can move it left or right.

So the steps would be: move up to reach the `is` rule, then move it left towards the `baba` text block and right towards the `win` rule to form ""baba is win"". Once that rule is created, touching the `win` rule would make me the winner.

Therefore, the next action should be to move up to get to the `is` rule's position, then manipulate it.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I become that object. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. There's also a door and a key, but the door might be a stop if there's a ""rule stop"" nearby. Let me check the rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you,"" so other properties like stop or win are defined by their respective text blocks.

The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something? But the door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. If the door is a stop, I can't pass through it. However, since I'm Baba and the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" I might be able to move through the door unless there's a ""stop"" rule acting on it. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule stop"" at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. Wait, that's not directly on the door. Maybe the door isn't stopped unless the rule is applied. 

The key is to the left of the door. If I can get the key, maybe it changes something? But I don't see a ""key is win"" rule here. The active rule is still ""win"" at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So maybe the direct path is to move up towards the win object. 

Looking at my position, I need to figure out where I am. The objects listed are positions relative to me, I think. The ""rule `is` 3 step up"" suggests that the 'is' text block is above me. Since ""baba is you"" is active, I might be adjacent to some of these rules. To reach the ""win"" at 1 step right and 3 steps up, I need to move up three times and right once. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Check the walls: There's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. That's to my left upper side. If I move up, I might hit that wall. But since I'm Baba and the only rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe walls don't stop me? Wait, no. The default is that objects with ""stop"" property can't be moved through. But the current active rules don't include any ""stop"" except the ones defined by text blocks. The ""rule stop"" is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up, which isn't on my path. 

Alternatively, perhaps the walls are just obstacles that I can push or move if they aren't stopped. Wait, the rules say you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move myself, but other objects like walls might be stoppable. Let me check the active rules again. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so other objects like walls have their default properties. If a wall is defined as ""stop,"" then I can't move through it. But in the current observation, the active rules don't include ""wall is stop,"" right? Wait, looking back, there's a ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 2 step up"" which probably means ""wall is [something]"". Wait, the way the rules are presented might be that each rule is a text block like ""WALL IS STOP"" or ""BALL IS WIN"". But in the current observation, the active rules only show ""baba is you"". The other rules are part of the level layout but not currently active? Or are they active? 

Wait, the ""Active rules"" section lists ""baba is you"". The other rules mentioned in the objects are probably text blocks on the map that are not currently forming active rules. For example, the ""rule `is` 3 step up"" is a text block, but unless paired with another subject and property, it doesn't form an active rule. So the only active rule is ""baba is you"". 

Therefore, other objects like walls have their default properties. If a wall is normally a stop, then I can't move through it. But since there's no active rule like ""wall is stop"" or ""baba is stop"", maybe walls are passable? Wait, no. In Baba Is You, typically, walls are stop by default unless there's a rule changing that. But here, since the active rules don't include anything about walls being stop, maybe they are not. But I need to be careful. 

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I try to move up towards the win object, I would first move up once, then up again, but the wall is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe my position is such that those walls are adjacent. If I'm facing a wall, I can't move into it. But I need to know my current position relative to these objects. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different location. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I move left, I might reach the key, but that's the opposite direction of the win. The win is to the right and up. So perhaps the correct path is to move up three times and right once, avoiding walls. 

But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I'm at position (0,0), then moving up three steps would take me to (0,3). The win is at (1,3). The wall at (4,-3) maybe? This is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on the relative positions. 

The ""rule `win`"" is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So if I can move right and up towards that, that would be the goal. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: moving up from my current position, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I'm at a position where moving up would take me towards that wall, I might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe the wall is blocking a different part of the map. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" text block to be under me, then touching it would make me win. Or change the ""baba"" text block to be ""win"" so that I become win. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""win"", I could create a new rule like ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block and possibly other text blocks. 

Currently, the ""baba"" text block is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" text block is at 3 steps up. So if I can move the ""is"" block down to align with ""baba"" and ""win"", I could create the rule ""baba is win"". That would make me win. 

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up. From my current position, moving up three times would reach that ""is"" block. Then, maybe move it left or right to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". 

Let me think step by step. 

1. Current active rule: baba is you.
2. Goal: reach win or make baba win.
3. Objects nearby: win is 1 right, 3 up. Key is left, door is left of win.
4. Walls are present but not sure if they block.
5. There's an ""is"" text block 3 steps up. If I can move that next to ""baba"" and ""win"", create ""baba is win"".

So the plan is to move to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up, then move it to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". 

To get to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up, I need to move up three times. But before that, check if there are walls in the way. The wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up might be adjacent to that path. If moving up would take me into that wall, then I can't. But if the wall is elsewhere, maybe I can path around. 

Alternatively, maybe the wall is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up relative to me, meaning if I move up, I'm at 0,3 and the wall is at -4,3. That would be to the left of me, so moving up wouldn't take me there. 

Assuming I can move up safely, the next step is to grab the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba and the only rule is ""baba is you"", I can move other objects that are not stopped. The ""is"" block is a text block, so I can move it. 

Once I have the ""is"" block, I need to move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" text block is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So placing the ""is"" between them would create ""baba is win"". 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 3 steps up to be between ""baba"" and ""win"". Let's see their positions:

- ""baba"" is at 9 left, 3 down.
- ""is"" is at 3 up.
- ""win"" is at 1 right, 3 up.

So the ""is"" block is currently above me, while ""baba"" is far to the left and down, and ""win"" is to the right and up. 

This might require moving the ""is"" block down to align with ""win"", then left to connect with ""baba"". Alternatively, move ""win"" or ""baba"" closer. 

But moving ""win"" requires finding its text block, which is at 1 right, 3 up. Since ""win"" is already a rule, perhaps I can't move it unless its text block is moved. Similarly, ""baba"" is at 9 left, 3 down. 

This seems complex. Maybe a simpler approach is to first reach the ""is"" block and then move it. 

So the immediate action should be to move up towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps up. Each time I move up, I get closer. 

Looking at the previous actions, the assistant kept moving right, but that might not be the best path. Maybe moving up is better. 

In the last few observations, moving right multiple times moved the key further left, but the goal is the win object which is to the right. So perhaps moving right towards the win is correct. 

Wait, the win is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So moving right once gets me closer horizontally, and up three times vertically. 

But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I'm at position (0,0), moving up to (0,3), the wall is at (-4,3), which is to the left. So moving up wouldn't hit that wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the walls are in the way of moving right. The wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up could be at (-4,3), which is left of me, so moving right wouldn't interact with it. 

This is getting a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the coordinates, I need to prioritize moving towards the win. 

Another angle: since the key is moving left each time I move right, perhaps I need to get the key first to unlock something. But I don't see a rule that ties the key to the door or win. 

Alternatively, if I can create a rule like ""key is win"", then touching the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win"". 

The ""key"" is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. The ""win"" is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So placing ""is"" between them would make ""key is win"". Then, touching the key would make me win. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from 3 steps up to be between ""key"" (8 left,3 up) and ""win"" (1 right,3 up). The ""is"" is currently at 3 steps up, so it's in the same horizontal line as the win but 3 steps up vertically. To move it down to the same vertical line as the key and win (which are at 3 steps up), wait, no. The key and win are both at 3 steps up. The ""is"" is at 3 steps up, so it's already in the same horizontal line? Wait, the coordinates might be relative. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps up, pick it up, and then move it to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". 

So the next action should be to move up to reach the ""is"" block. Each up movement gets me closer. Previously, the assistant moved right multiple times, but that might not be effective. 

Alternatively, since the key is moving left each time I move right, maybe moving right repeatedly is pushing the key further away, which isn't helpful. 

Given that the active rule is ""baba is you"", and I need to create a new rule to change the win condition or make myself win, the priority is to manipulate the text blocks. 

The most straightforward way is to create ""baba is win"" by placing the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win"". 

The ""baba"" text block is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" block is at 3 steps up. 

To connect them, I need to move the ""is"" block to the left and down. 

So from the current position, moving down towards the ""is"" block? Or moving left and down? 

This is getting too ambiguous without knowing the exact layout. But based on the relative positions given, the ""is"" block is 3 steps up. So moving up three times would get me to it. Once there, I can move it left to connect with ""baba"" and down to connect with ""win"". 

Therefore, the immediate action should be to move up towards the ""is"" block. 

Looking back at the previous actions, the assistant kept moving right, but that might not be leading towards the ""is"" block. 

In the last observation, after moving right several times, the key's position changed, but the ""is"" block is still at 3 steps up. 

So the correct action now is to move up once to get closer to the ""is"" block. 

Therefore, the chosen action is up.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but sometimes you have to change the rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a door at 7 left, 3 up. There's also a ball labeled as ""win"" at 1 left, 1 up. But wait, the active rules don't mention ""ball is win"" anymore. Let me check the objects again. Oh, right, the ""ball is win"" rule might have been moved or changed. In the current active rules, it's just ""baba is you.""

So, to win, I probably need to get to the door or something labeled win. The door is at 7 left, 3 up, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at 4 left, 3 up, and others. Maybe I can move the ""rule is"" blocks to change the rules. 

There's a rule `is` at 3 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or ""door is key."" But how? The rules say you can only move objects that aren't STOP. The walls are STOP, so I can't move them. The rule `is` is not STOP, so maybe I can pick it up and move it.

The key is at 8 left, 1 down. If I get the key, maybe I can unlock the door. But the key is behind a wall at 4 left and 1 down. So I need to navigate past that. But with ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls? Wait, no, walls are STOP unless their rule is changed. The current rule is ""wall is wall,"" which makes them STOP. So I can't go through walls.

Hmm. Maybe I need to change the ""wall is wall"" rule. There's a rule `wall` at 9 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule, I could change what a wall is. For example, making ""wall is nothing"" so I can walk through them. But how to move the rule `wall`? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's see where the rule `wall` is located. It's at 9 left, 2 up. My position is probably where the ""baba"" object is, which is at 9 left, 3 steps down. So from there, to get to the rule `wall` at 9 left, 2 up, I can move up once. 

If I move up to grab the rule `wall`, then I can move it somewhere else. For example, placing it next to the existing ""wall is wall"" rule to override it. But I need to see if that's possible. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is you"" so that I can turn into a wall and walk through other walls. Wait, but ""baba is you"" is still active. If I make ""baba is wall,"" then I would be a wall, but I'm not sure if that helps. 

Another idea: The ""door"" is at 7 left, 3 up. There's a rule `door` at 2 step up. Maybe I can make ""door is win"" so that touching the door makes me win. But to do that, I need to move the `door` rule and the `win` rule together to form ""door is win."" The current `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So if I can move the `door` rule next to the `win` rule, I can create the new rule. 

But getting those rules in position might require moving them past other objects. Let's see. The `door` rule is at 2 step up. If I move it right or left, maybe I can align it with the `win` rule. However, there are walls and other rules in the way. The key is at 8 left, 1 down, which might be a detour. 

Alternatively, since the key is present, maybe using the key to unlock the door. But how? If the door requires a key, perhaps creating a rule like ""key is open"" or ""door needs key."" But I'm not sure how that works in Baba Is You. 

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""win"" and ""wall"" are in the objects but not active unless combined with ""is."" So maybe the goal is to reach the door, but it's blocked by walls. To get past the walls, I need to change their rules. For example, making ""wall is stop"" is already the case, but if I can change it to ""wall is nothing,"" then I can walk through them. 

To do that, I need to find the rule `wall` which is at 9 left, 2 up. If I move that rule to somewhere else, maybe overwrite the existing ""wall is wall"" rule. For example, placing the `wall` rule on top of the existing rule so that it becomes ""wall is [new property]."" 

So the steps could be: 
1. Move to the `wall` rule at 9 left, 2 up.
2. Pick it up and move it to the existing ""wall is wall"" rule location (8 left, 3 up?), combining them to change the rule. 

But how to navigate there? My current position is where the ""baba"" object is, which is at 9 left, 3 steps down. So to get to the `wall` rule at 9 left, 2 up, I just need to move up once. Then, move the `wall` rule to the location of the existing ""wall is wall"" rule. 

Once I do that, the rule would become ""wall is [whatever the moved rule says]."" If I move the `wall` rule to overwrite the existing ""wall is wall,"" then the new rule would be ""wall is [nothing?]"" depending on how the movement works. 

Alternatively, create a new rule by placing `wall` next to `is` and another property. For example, moving `wall` next to `is` and `key` to make ""wall is key,"" but that might not help. 

Alternatively, move the `is` rule to connect with other rules. There's an `is` rule at 3 step up. If I can move that to connect with `win` and `baba`, making ""baba is win."" That would make touching Baba himself a win condition. Then I could just stay in place. 

To do that, I need to move the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`. The `baba` object is at 9 left, 3 steps down. The `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up, which is 8 left, 3 up (assuming the coordinates are relative). So moving the `is` rule from 3 step up (which is 6 left, 3 up?) to between `baba` and `win`. 

This is getting a bit confusing with the coordinates. Let me try to visualize the map. 

The key is at 8 left, 3 step up. The door is at 7 left, 3 step up. The `wall` rule is at 9 left, 2 step up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up, which might be 6 left, 3 up. The `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up, so 7 left, 3 up. 

Baba is at 9 left, 3 steps down, which is probably the bottom right corner. The `is` rule is at 3 step up from Baba's position, so moving up three steps from 9 left, 3 down would be 9 left, 0 up? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. So ""3 step up"" means three steps north from Baba. 

In any case, the plan is to either reach the door (by changing wall rules) or make Baba the win condition. 

Since the previous attempts to move right kept failing, maybe I need to focus on moving the `is` rule to create a new rule. For example, moving `is` next to `baba` and `win` to make ""baba is win."" 

To do that, I need to navigate the `is` rule from its current position (3 step up) to be adjacent to both `baba` and `win`. Let's see: 

Current `is` position: 3 step up from Baba. If Baba is at position (0,0), then `is` is at (0,3). The `win` rule is at (1,3), and `baba` is at (0,0). So to place `is` between them, move it to (0,3) -> (1,3) is the `win` rule. So maybe move the `is` rule to the right, next to `win`, and then stack `baba` on top? 

Wait, in Baba Is You, you place the rules by having the subject next to the verb and object with an 'IS' in between. So to make ""baba is win,"" you need 'baba' next to 'is' and then 'win' next to 'is'. 

So if the `is` rule is between `baba` and `win`, then the rule becomes active. 

Currently, the `is` rule is at 3 step up. The `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So if I can move the `is` rule one step to the left, it would be adjacent to `baba` (if `baba` is at the origin), but I think `baba` is somewhere else. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to move the `is` rule towards the `win` rule and `baba`. Let's say I'm at the `baba` position, which is at 9 left, 3 steps down. To reach the `is` rule at 3 step up, I need to move up three times. Once there, I can pick up the `is` rule and move it right towards the `win` rule. 

If I move the `is` rule to the right, next to the `win` rule, and then place `baba` next to it, that would create ""baba is win."" 

So step by step: 
1. Move up three times to reach the `is` rule at 3 step up.
2. Pick up the `is` rule and move it right to be next to the `win` rule.
3. Ensure `baba` is adjacent to the `is` rule so the new rule activates.

Once that's done, touching Baba would make me win. Then I can just stay in place. 

Alternatively, if I can't get the `is` rule in position, maybe focus on changing the wall rules. For example, moving the `wall` rule to overwrite the existing ""wall is wall"" with ""wall is nothing,"" allowing me to walk through walls. Then navigate around to the door or ball. 

But to do that, I need to reach the `wall` rule at 9 left, 2 step up. From Baba's position, that's one step up and six steps left. But there are walls at 4 left, 3 up, which are STOP, so I can't go through them. 

This seems challenging. Maybe the best bet is to create the ""baba is win"" rule. Let's try that. 

First, move up to get to the `is` rule. Then move right to align with `win`. 

So the actions would be: up, up, up (to reach the `is` rule), then right, right, right (to move the `is` rule next to `win`), then ensure `baba` is adjacent. 

But in the current observation, after moving up, where exactly are the `is` and `win` rules? 

In the latest observation, the `is` rule is at 3 step up. The `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So if I'm at the same x-coordinate as `is`, moving right would get me to the `win` rule's position. 

So the plan is: move up to reach the `is` rule, then move right to place it next to `win`, creating ""baba is win."" 

Therefore, the next action should be to move up first to get to the `is` rule's location. Wait, but in the previous attempts, moving up led to a different position. Let me check the coordinates again. 

The current observation shows that after several ups and rights, the key and other objects have moved. The latest `is` rule is at 3 step up. So from Baba's current position (which is at 9 left, 3 steps down based on previous observations), moving up three times would place me at 9 left, 0 up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up, so perhaps that's 9 left, 3 up. 

But the `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up, which would be 8 left, 3 up. So if I move the `is` rule from 9 left, 3 up to 8 left, 3 up (one step left), then place it between `baba` (at 9 left, 3 down?) and `win` (8 left, 3 up), that might work. 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the simplest action is to keep moving right towards the `win` rule or the `key`, hoping to reach them eventually. Alternatively, try to move the `is` rule towards the `win` by moving it right. 

In the latest observation, the `is` rule is at 3 step up. If I move right from there, I can position it next to the `win` rule. So the action should be to move right while holding the `is` rule. 

But first, I need to pick up the `is` rule. To do that, I have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that picks it up. 

So the steps would be: move up to reach the `is` rule, then move right to place it next to `win`. 

Therefore, the next action is to move right.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the environment by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 7 steps left and 3 up, which might be blocking the path. There are walls and stop rules everywhere. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is right above the win, so maybe if I can move the ""win"" text block to combine with ""baba"" or something else.

The key is nearby. If I can get the key, maybe it opens the door? But how? The door's rule is ""door"" and it's 2 steps up. If I can change the door's property, maybe to ""win,"" then stepping on it would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the door's rule.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" block down to where the ""is"" is, then maybe I can create a new rule like ""door is win."" But how do I move the blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and not blocked by stop or wall.

Baba is you, so I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. Let me check the positions again. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So if I move right from my current position, I can reach the ""win"" block. Then, I can push it down to the ""is"" rule's location. By doing that, maybe I can form ""door is win"" if I place ""win"" next to the door's rule.

But where is the door's rule? The door is at 7 steps left and 3 up, and the ""door"" rule is 2 steps up. So if I can move the ""win"" block next to the ""door"" rule, then combining them with an ""is"" would make ""door is win."" Then stepping on the door would make it a win condition.

Alternatively, maybe changing ""baba"" to ""win"" would work. If I can move the ""win"" block next to the ""baba"" rule, which is 9 steps left and 3 steps down. But that's further away. Maybe focusing on the door first is better.

So the plan is: move right to the ""win"" block, then move down to the ""door"" rule, and place ""win"" next to it with an ""is."" But I need to check the layout. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the starting position, maybe near the bottom. The ""win"" is up and to the right. Moving right once gets me to the ""win"" block. Then moving down to the ""door"" which is 2 steps up. Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 2 steps up, so if I'm at the ""win"" block (1 step right, 3 up), moving down two steps would get me to 1 step right and 1 up. Then maybe left or right to reach the ""door"" rule.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""win"" block, move it to the area where the ""door"" rule is. Then combine it with an ""is"" to make ""door is win."" Once that's done, stepping on the door would make it a win.

But how to physically move the blocks? Each action is a single step. So I need to navigate to each block, pick them up (by moving into their tile if I'm a ""you"" object), and then move them adjacent to the target.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any non-stop objects. The ""is"" rules are movable. So the steps could be:

1. Move right to the ""win"" block (1 step right, 3 up).
2. Pick up the ""win"" block and move it down to the area where the ""door"" rule is (2 steps up).
3. Place the ""win"" next to the ""door"" rule and an ""is"" to form ""door is win.""
4. Then go to the door and step on it, which now is a win.

But the exact path needs to be calculated. Let's see the positions again.

Current active rules: ""baba is you.""

Objects:
- key: 8 left, 3 up
- door: 7 left, 3 up
- wall: 4 left, 3 up
- rule `is`: 3 step up
- rule `win`: 1 right, 3 up
- rule `wall`: 9 left, 2 up
- rule `stop`: 7 left, 2 up
- etc.

So the ""win"" rule is at position (assuming current position is origin): x=-1, y=3 (since 1 step right from origin is x=1, but the description says ""1 step to the right and 3 step up,"" so maybe coordinates are relative).

To get to the ""win"" block, move right once (action: right). Then, from there, need to move down to reach the ""door"" rule which is at 2 step up. So from y=3, moving down twice to y=1. Then check the x position. The ""door"" rule is at 2 step up, which would be y=2. Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again.

Each object's position is described relative to the player's current position. For example, ""key 7 step to the left and 3 step up"" means the key is at x=-7, y=3. The ""win"" rule is at x=1, y=3. The ""door"" object is at x=-7, y=3. The ""door"" rule (text block) is at x=2, y=2 (since ""1 step to the right and 1 step up"" from where? Maybe from the player's position).

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move right to the ""win"" block, then move down to the area where the ""door"" rule is located. Once there, place the ""win"" next to the ""door"" rule and an ""is"" to create ""door is win.""

To do that, I need to navigate from the ""win"" block (x=1, y=3) to where the ""door"" rule is. The ""door"" rule is at x=2, y=2. So move down once to y=2, then right once to x=2. Now, place the ""win"" block next to the ""door"" rule and an ""is"" block. But where is the ""is"" block in this area?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 5 step to the left (x=-5, y=?) and another at 3 step up (x=?, y=3). Wait, the ""is"" rules are at various positions. The one at 3 step up is at y=3. The ""door"" rule is at x=2, y=2. So maybe I need to bring the ""is"" block down to that area.

Alternatively, use an existing ""is"" block. There's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up (y=1) and another at 6 step to the left (x=-6). This is getting too vague without a visual map. Let's try to prioritize.

The immediate goal is to manipulate the rules to make either the door a win or Baba a win. Since the door is blocked by walls and stop rules, maybe changing the door's property is better.

So, steps:
1. Move right to the ""win"" block (action: right).
2. Move down to y=2 (action: down).
3. Move right to x=2 (action: right).
4. Now, check if there's an ""is"" block nearby. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up (y=1) is one step down from here. So move down to y=1 (action: down), pick up the ""is"" block, then move up to y=2, place it next to the ""door"" rule and the ""win"" block to form ""door is win.""

But this requires multiple moves and carrying blocks. Alternatively, if there's an ""is"" block already adjacent, use that.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block next to the ""door"" rule and an existing ""is"" block. For example, if there's an ""is"" at x=-5, y=1 step up, that might be too far.

This is quite complex. Maybe the simplest valid action is to move right towards the ""win"" block, as previous actions were right and up, but the system kept failing. Maybe the correct action now is to move right again to reach the ""win"" block and then interact with it.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is to reach the 'win' object, which is probably the door or something similar. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move like Baba.

Looking at the map, there's a key at 8 steps left and 3 up. A door at 7 left and 3 up. Walls are blocking the straight path. The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 up. But there's a wall there. Maybe I need to move the 'win' rule or change something else.

The 'is' rules are scattered. Rule 'win' is at 1 step right and 3 up. Maybe if I can move that 'win' rule closer to the door? Or perhaps change the 'win' condition to something else. Also, there's a 'ball' rule up there, but I don't know if that's useful.

Wait, there's a rule `is` at 3 step up. Maybe I can move that 'is' rule to connect 'baba' with another property. For example, making 'baba' 'win' by creating a rule ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to move the 'is' text block next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Looking at the positions, rule `baba` is at 9 left and 3 down. The 'is' rule is at 8 left and 3 down. If I move right towards the 'is' rule, maybe I can attach it to 'baba' and 'win'. But the path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, there's another 'is' rule at 3 step up. Maybe moving that one down?

Alternatively, the key is at 8 left and 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe that opens the door. But the door is at 7 left and 3 up, which is adjacent to the key. However, the door might be a 'stop' if the rule says so. Let me check the rules. There's a rule `door` at 2 step up. The current active rules don't define door as stop, so maybe I can push past it? Wait, 'stop' is a rule at 6 left and 2 up. So door might not be stop. But the door's position is 7 left and 3 up, which is one step left of the key.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". So if I can reach the door, since it's not blocked by a 'stop' rule, I might be able to push it? Or maybe the door is the win condition. But the 'win' rule is separate. Hmm.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I need to move the 'win' rule to the door. The 'win' rule is currently 1 step right and 3 up from where? Let me visualize the positions. If the 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 up from Baba's position, which is 9 left and 3 down. So adding 1 right and 3 up would place it at 8 left, 0 up? Not sure. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position.

Alternatively, the 'win' object is somewhere else. The active rules define 'win' as a rule object, not a win condition yet. To make 'win' mean the door, I need to create a rule like ""door is win"". But to do that, I need to move the 'is' text next to 'door' and 'win'.

The 'door' rule is at 2 step up. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So if I can move the 'is' rule between them, that could work. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the map.

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up. The 'win' rule is at 1 right and 3 up from where? Maybe from Baba's position. If I move right towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up, perhaps I can reach it. But the way might be blocked. Alternatively, move up to the 'is' at 3 step up, then right to attach it to 'win' and 'door'.

Alternatively, the key is nearby. If I pick up the key, maybe that unlocks the door. But how? The key is at 8 left and 3 up. To get there, I need to move left 8 steps? But there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 left and 3 up is a wall. So moving left from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down) would require navigating around walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap the possible steps:

1. Move towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up to create new rules.
2. Use the 'is' rule to make 'baba' 'win' or change the 'win' condition to the door.
3. Navigate around walls to reach the door or adjust the rules.

Given that the previous actions were moving right and up, maybe the 'is' rule at 3 step up is the key. If I can move down to that 'is' rule and then right to connect 'baba' with 'win', that could work. But how to move there without hitting walls.

Current position of Baba: rule `baba` is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if I move right, I might get to the 'is' rule at 8 left and 3 down. Then move up to the 'is' at 3 step up. Let's see the coordinates:

Baba is at 9 left, 3 down.

There's a rule `is` at 8 left and 3 down (same level as Baba). So moving right once gets to that 'is' rule. Then moving up to the 'is' at 3 step up. Wait, the 'is' rule at 3 step up is probably higher up on the map. Let's assume that moving up from 3 down brings us to higher positions. So moving up from 3 down to 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. steps up.

The 'is' rule at 3 step up is positioned somewhere above. If I can reach that 'is' rule, I can link it to 'baba' and 'win' to make the win condition be Baba himself.

Alternatively, the 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 step up from somewhere. Maybe from the current 'is' rule's position. This is getting a bit confusing with the coordinate system.

Another angle: Since the goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, which is often a door or a specific tile, I need to either move towards it while avoiding walls or alter the rules to make Baba the win condition.

If I can change the rule to ""baba is win"", then just moving towards where 'win' is defined (maybe the door) would suffice. To do that, I need to move the 'is' text next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Looking at the objects, 'baba' is at 9 left, 3 down. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from somewhere. Let's assume it's relative to the 'is' rule's position. If the 'is' rule is at 3 step up, then the 'win' rule is 1 step right from there. So positioning would be 3 up from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down) would be 9 left, 0 down (or 3 up). Then 1 step right would be 8 left, 3 up. But there's a wall at 8 left, 3 up (wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up? Wait, no, looking at the objects:

Objects list includes ""wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up"". So that's a wall at 4 left, 3 up. Not sure about the others. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If the 'is' rule is at 3 step up, then the 'win' rule's position is 1 step right from there. So maybe 3 up from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down) is 9 left, 0 down (3 up), then 1 right to 8 left, 0 down. But there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up, which is different.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best move is to move towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up to manipulate the rules. So from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down), moving up 3 steps would reach that 'is' rule. But there might be walls in the way. Checking the objects: wall at 4 left, 3 up. So if I move up from 3 down to 3 up, my position would be 9 left, 0 down (assuming up is negative down). But the wall is at 4 left, 3 up, which is a different position. So maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, moving right to the 'is' rule at 8 left, 3 down, then up to the 'is' at 3 step up. That might be possible. So actions would be: right (to reach 8 left, 3 down), then up three times to reach the 'is' at 3 step up. Then, move right or left to connect 'baba' with 'win'.

Alternatively, the 'is' rule at 1 step up (rule `is` 1 step up) could be used. Moving up once from Baba's position to 9 left, 2 down, then right to reach that 'is' rule. Then move up again to the 'is' at 3 step up.

Once I have an 'is' rule nearby, I can push it next to 'baba' and 'win' to create the ""baba is win"" rule. That would make Baba the win condition, so I just need to move to where 'win' is defined, which is the 'win' rule object, maybe adjacent to the door.

So step by step:

1. Move right once to reach the 'is' rule at 8 left, 3 down.
2. Move up three times to reach the 'is' rule at 3 step up.
3. Move right or left to position the 'is' between 'baba' and 'win'.
4. This creates ""baba is win"", allowing me to just move to where 'win' is (the door).

But need to check if movement is possible without hitting walls. The walls are at specific positions, so the path might be clear.

Alternatively, if I can pick up the 'is' rule and move it next to 'baba' and 'win', that would do the trick. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move text blocks that aren't 'stop'.

The 'is' rule at 3 step up is likely above the current position. So moving up from 3 down to 3 up would be possible if there's no wall in between. The walls are at 4 left, 3 up and others, but maybe the path is clear.

So the next action should be to move up towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up. Let's say the 'is' is one step up from the current position. Then action 'up' would get closer. But in the current observation, the 'is' rule at 3 step up is probably several steps up. So maybe multiple 'up' actions are needed.

But the user is asking for a single action. So the best immediate action is to move 'up' to get closer to the 'is' rule needed to create the new rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a 'win' object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and up, a door to the left and up, and several walls. There are also some 'rule' blocks around. The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. The 'is' rule is directly at 3 steps up, which might be important because 'is' is needed to create or modify rules.

Hmm, I need to get to the 'win' rule to maybe change it or use it. But the path is blocked by walls and the 'stop' rule. Wait, 'baba is you' means I can move, but can I move the walls? No, because walls are defined as 'wall' and unless there's a rule that says walls can be moved, I can't. But the 'stop' rule might make certain objects immovable. Let me check the active rules again. The current active rules only have 'baba is you,' so maybe other rules like 'stop' are not active now?

Wait, no. The 'stop' rule is present on the map but is it active? Active rules are the ones that are currently in play. The observation shows active rules as just ""baba is you."" So the 'stop' rule is on the map but not active. That means I can potentially move past the walls if I can get through them. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules to create a path. For example, if I can make a rule that says 'wall is stop' or something, but I don't have a 'stop' rule active. Wait, the 'stop' rule is on the map but not active. So if I can move the 'stop' rule somewhere else, or maybe change its subject and property.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 7 step to the left and 2 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, maybe the walls would no longer be stopped. But to move a rule, I have to be next to it and it shouldn't be under a 'stop' or similar. Let's see where I am. Wait, the user hasn't provided my position, but the objects are described relative to some reference point, probably Baba's position. Assuming I'm at Baba's position, which is at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down according to one of the objects. So maybe I need to move towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up to create new rules.

The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can get to that 'win' rule and maybe combine it with another 'is' rule, I could change the win condition. But the path there is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that says 'key is win' and then pick up the key to reach the door or something. But I need to be able to move the key first.

Wait, there's a rule `key` at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can move that key towards the 'win' rule, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But again, the path is blocked. Alternatively, if I can make myself a 'key' by creating a rule 'baba is key', then I could pick up the key. But to do that, I need to have an 'is' rule nearby to combine with.

Looking at the rules on the map, there are multiple 'is' rules. The one at 1 step to the right and 3 step up (same as the 'win' rule's position) could be useful. If I can move the 'is' rule next to Baba and the 'key' rule, I could create 'baba is key', making me a key. Then I could move the key to the door. But how to get to those positions?

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the 'win' rule by moving it. If I can move the 'win' rule to my position, then maybe that makes me win. But I need to be able to move the 'win' rule. Let me check the positions again. The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from wherever I am. If I move up three steps and then right once, I could get there. But the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 4 step to the left and 3 step up is directly in the way. Unless I can remove that wall's 'wall' property.

Wait, the wall's rule is 'rule `wall` 8 step to the left and 2 step up'. So the actual wall is at 4 step to the left and 3 step up. To remove it, I might need to change its property. If I can move the 'wall' rule away from that wall, then the wall would no longer be a wall. For example, if I take the 'wall' rule and move it to another object, making that object a wall instead. But that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says 'wall is stop' or something, but I don't have a 'stop' rule active. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Active rule: Baba is you.
- Need to reach 'win' which is 1 right, 3 up.
- Path blocked by walls and possibly 'stop' (but 'stop' rule is inactive).
- Available rules: multiple 'is' rules, 'win', 'key', 'door', 'wall', 'stop' on the map.

Possible actions:

1. Move towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up to create new rules.
2. Move the 'win' rule to myself to declare myself win.
3. Move the 'key' rule to combine with 'is' to become a key.
4. Move the 'door' rule to change door properties.
5. Move the 'wall' rule to change a wall's property.

But how to do any of this? Let's think step by step.

First, where am I located? The objects refer to positions relative to something, probably Baba. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. So assuming that's my position, I need to move relative to that.

Wait, the observation lists objects with positions relative to the reference point. If the reference is Baba's position (rule `baba`), then my position is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down from the reference? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the positions are relative to the top-left corner or something else. This is a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are in grid coordinates. For example, each step up, down, left, right changes the coordinates. Let's assume that the reference point is the top-left corner, and positions are given as (x, y), where left is negative x and up is positive y.

But this is getting too complicated. Let's focus on the available rules and objects.

The key is at 8 step to the left and 3 step up from Baba. The door is at 7 step to the left and 3 step up. The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 step up from Baba. So if I can move right once and up three steps, I reach the 'win' rule. But the path is blocked by the wall at 4 step to the left and 3 step up. Wait, the wall's position is 4 step to the left and 3 step up from Baba. So if I'm at Baba's position (assuming that's the starting point), moving up three steps would take me to the wall. Then how to get past it?

If the 'stop' rule is inactive, then maybe I can push past the wall. But walls are usually immovable unless there's a rule allowing it. Since the only active rule is 'baba is you', maybe I can move through the wall? But in Baba Is You, typically walls are stoppers unless their 'stop' property is removed. But here, the 'stop' rule is present but not active. So perhaps the walls are not stopping me.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the 'stop' rule is what makes an object a blocker. If the 'stop' rule is not active, then the walls might not block movement. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you"". The 'stop' rule is on the map but not active, meaning it's a text block that's not part of the current rules. So the walls might not be stopping me. That could mean I can walk through them.

If that's the case, then I can move up three steps to reach the 'win' rule. But why haven't I done that before? Maybe I was trying to move right first, but perhaps moving up directly is the solution.

So the plan is: move up three steps to reach the 'win' rule. Since the walls might not be blocking, I can pass through them. Then,once I'm at the 'win' rule, maybe combining it with an 'is' rule would make me win. But how?

Alternatively, the 'win' rule is already a win condition. In Baba Is You, if you touch the 'win' object, you win. So if I can move to the 'win' rule's position, which is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from my current position, then touching it would make me win.

Therefore, the correct action is to move right then up three times, or up three times then right. But according to the previous actions, the assistant kept moving right and up, but the system kept defaulting to idle. Maybe the path is still blocked, or there's a different interpretation.

Wait, the 'win' rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If I'm at Baba's position (9 left, 3 down), moving right once would make me at 8 left, 3 down. Then moving up three steps would reach 8 left, 0 down (assuming up increases the y-coordinate). But the 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 up from Baba's position, which would be 8 left (Baba is at 9 left, so 9-1=8 left) and 3 up (Baba is at 3 down, so 3+3=6 up?). This is confusing without a grid.

Alternatively, the positions are described as steps from a certain point. For example, the 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the current position. So if I'm facing a certain direction, moving right once and up three times would get me there.

But given the previous failures, maybe the correct action is to move up three times and then right once. However, the system might be expecting a single action each time. So the assistant needs to choose the next step.

Looking at the last observation, the previous actions were right, down, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, etc., but they kept failing. Maybe the correct path is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution involves manipulating the rules. For example, creating a rule that says 'baba is win', making Baba the win condition. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to Baba and the 'win' rule.

The 'is' rule is at 3 step up. If I can move up to that 'is' rule, then combine it with the 'win' rule which is 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So moving up three steps to reach the 'is' rule, then right once to reach the 'win' rule. Then, creating the rule 'baba is win' by placing the 'baba' text block (which is at 9 left, 3 down) with 'is' and 'win'.

But how to move the 'baba' text block? Since 'baba is you', I can move it. So the steps would be:

1. Move up three times to reach the 'is' rule at 3 step up.
2. Move right once to reach the 'win' rule.
3. Move the 'baba' text block to the 'is' and 'win' rules to create 'baba is win'.

But each action is a single step. So perhaps the first action is to move up to get to the 'is' rule.

In the current observation, the 'is' rule is at 3 step up. So the action should be 'up' to move towards it. Then, after moving up, the next action would be to move right to reach the 'win' rule. But according to the previous steps, the assistant kept moving right and up, but maybe that's not the optimal path.

Alternatively, since the 'is' rule is directly above, moving up three times first would position me next to it. Then, move right to the 'win' rule. Then, move the 'baba' text block (which is at 9 left, 3 down) to the 'is' and 'win' to form 'baba is win'.

But how to physically move the 'baba' text block? Since I'm Baba, I can push other text blocks if they're not stopped. So if I'm next to the 'baba' text block, I can move it. But in the current setup, the 'baba' text block is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down, which is probably far away from where I am.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let's try to outline the possible steps again:

1. Goal: Make Baba the win condition or reach the win object.
2. Current active rule: Baba is you.
3. To create a new rule, need to move 'is' next to subject and property.
4. The 'win' rule is at 1 right, 3 up. The 'is' rule is at 3 up. So if I move up three times and then right once, I can be next to both 'is' and 'win'.
5. Then, create 'baba is win' by placing 'baba', 'is', 'win' in a row.
6. Since I'm Baba, I can move the 'baba' text block to the new rule's position.

But each action is a single step. So the first action should be 'up' to move towards the 'is' rule.

In the latest observation, after several ups and rights, the position of the 'win' and 'is' might have changed? No, the objects' positions are fixed unless moved. So the 'is' rule is always at 3 step up, and 'win' is 1 right, 3 up.

Therefore, the correct sequence is to move up three times to reach the 'is' rule, then right once to reach the 'win' rule, then move the 'baba' text block next to them to form the new rule. However, each of these requires multiple actions, but the system expects a single action per step.

Given that, the immediate action should be 'up' to get closer to the 'is' rule. The previous actions were moving right and up in a way that might not be optimal. For example, moving right first could take me away from the 'is' rule which is directly above.

So the best action now is to move 'up' to approach the 'is' rule at 3 step up.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but since the rules can be changed, I need to see what current rules there are.

The active rule is ""baba is you"", which means whatever I do, Baba is the player. So I can move around. Now, looking at the objects: there's a key, a door, some walls, and rules scattered around. The WIN object is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which might block the path. Wait, no—the door is 7 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe the door is the way out? But doors are normally STOP unless changed. Let me check the rules.

Looking at the rules: There's ""win"" defined as being 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Also, ""rule `win` 1 step to the right"" is present. Wait, the active rules are just ""baba is you"". The other rules are on the map as objects. So maybe I can pick up the ""win"" rule and move it somewhere else to change what's a win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can make the door a WIN by moving the ""win"" text block next to it.

But first, where am I currently located? The exact position isn't given, but the key is 8 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I need to move towards the key first to interact with it? Or maybe the key isn't necessary right now. The door is at 7 steps left and 3 up. If I can get past the wall, maybe by rearranging rules.

Wait, the wall at 4 steps left and 3 up is a STOP. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can push objects that aren't STOP. But the wall is defined as STOP, so I can't push it. So maybe I need to change the wall's property. There's a ""rule `wall` 8 step to the left and 2 step up"". If I can move that rule next to the wall at 4 left and 3 up, maybe I can redefine the wall's property. For example, change it from ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"" or something else. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. There are several ""is"" rules on the map. For instance, ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"". If I can pick up that ""is"" rule and combine it with another object, maybe I can form a new rule. Like, moving ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"" to make ""door is win"", turning the door into a win condition. That might be a way to bypass the door being a STOP.

But how do I move these rules? The action is to move either left, right, up, down, or idle. So I need to position myself next to a rule and then move it to the desired location. Let's see the positions:

- The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If I can move that next to the door (7 left, 3 up), then ""door is win"" would make the door the win condition. But I need to be adjacent to both the ""win"" rule and the door to create that rule.

Currently, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. Where am I located? The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I'm near the key. To move the ""win"" rule to the door, I need to navigate there. Let's think step by step.

First, move right from the key's position to get to the ""win"" rule. Then, move up or down to reach the door. Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path. Also, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can combine that ""is"" with the ""win"" rule and the door, I could form ""door is win"".

But how to do that with movement? Each move is one step in a direction. Let's assume my current position is at the key's location (8 left, 3 up). To get to the ""win"" rule (1 right, 3 up), I need to move right 7 times. That's a lot, but maybe possible. Once there, I can pick up the ""win"" rule and move it towards the door (7 left, 3 up). The door is at 7 left, 3 up, which is one step left from the ""win"" rule's current position (1 right, 3 up). So moving left once would place the ""win"" rule next to the door. Then, if there's an ""is"" rule nearby, I can place it between the door and win to make ""door is win"".

But where is the ""is"" rule? There's one at 1 step right and 3 step up (same as the ""win"" rule), and another at 5 step left. Wait, the ""rule `is` 5 step to the left"" might be further away. Hmm. Alternatively, the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up could be used. If I move the ""win"" rule left next to the door, and then move the ""is"" rule from its current position (1 right, 3 up) to be between the door and the ""win"" rule, that would create ""door is win"".

To do that, I need to:

1. Move from the key's position (8 left, 3 up) to the ""win"" rule at (1 right, 3 up). That's 7 steps right.
2. Once there, move left once to be next to the door (7 left, 3 up).
3. Then, pick up the ""win"" rule and place it next to the door.
4. Next, move to the ""is"" rule at (1 right, 3 up) and bring it to between the door and the ""win"" rule.

But this requires multiple moves and ensuring that I can pick up and move the rules. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move objects that aren't STOP. The ""is"" rules and other text blocks are probably movable unless they're under a STOP property. Looking at the map, most objects are either walls (which are STOP) or rules/text blocks which might be movable.

So the plan is to:

- Move right to get to the ""win"" rule.
- Move left to position it next to the door.
- Then move the ""is"" rule from its current location to between the door and ""win"" to form ""door is win"".

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up (same as the ""win"" rule's position)
- rule `is` 5 step to the left
- rule `is` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down

If I can get the ""is"" rule at 5 step to the left, that's further left. Maybe not helpful. The closest ""is"" rule is the one at 1 step right and 3 up, which is where the ""win"" rule is.

So, moving right 7 steps to reach the ""win"" rule, then left to the door, then moving the ""win"" rule left next to the door, and then moving the ""is"" rule from its current position (same as ""win"") to between them.

But each move is one step. So perhaps the optimal path is:

1. Move right 7 times to reach the ""win"" rule.
2. Move left once to be at the door's position (7 left, 3 up).
3. Move the ""win"" rule left (but how? Since moving as a player, I can push the rule if it's adjacent. So if I'm next to the ""win"" rule, I can move in a direction that pushes it.
Wait, in Baba Is You, when you push an object, you have to be adjacent to it and move in the direction you want to push it. So if I'm next to the ""win"" rule and move left, I can push it left.

So step by step:

- Move right 7 times to get to the ""win"" rule's location (1 right, 3 up from key's original position).
- Now, I'm at (1 right, 3 up). The door is at (7 left, 3 up), which is 8 steps left from here. Wait, no—wait the key is 8 steps left and 3 up. So if the key is at 8 left,3 up, and the ""win"" rule is 1 right and 3 up, then my current position after moving right 7 times would be 8 left -7 right = 1 left, 3 up. Then the door is at 7 left,3 up, which is 6 steps left from there. So I need to move left 6 times to reach the door.

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, maybe I can move up or down first.

Alternatively, maybe the initial position isn't the key. The problem is that the observation doesn't specify where the player (Baba) is located. This is a bit ambiguous. The assistant has to assume based on the objects. Maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. Looking at the objects:

There's a rule `baba` at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. So perhaps the player is at that position. Let me check:

rule `baba` 8 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `is` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `you` 6 step to the left and 3 steps down

So the ""baba"" rule is at 8 left, 3 down. So the player's position is there. That makes more sense. So I'm at 8 left, 3 down. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. So I need to move up to reach the key.

The key is 1 step up from my current position (8 left, 3 down to 8 left, 3 up). So moving up once gets me to the key. Then, from there, I can move right to reach the ""win"" rule which is 1 step right and 3 step up from the key's position. Wait, the key is at 8 left,3 up. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 step up from where? The observation says ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"". Wait, the active rules are just ""baba is you"", and the other rules are objects on the map. So the positions are relative to some origin, possibly the player's position.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to map out the coordinates assuming the player is at (0,0). Then:

- rule `baba` is at (8 left, 3 down) → (-8, -3)
- rule `is` at (7 left, 3 down) → (-7, -3)
- rule `you` at (6 left, 3 down) → (-6, -3)
- key is at (8 left, 3 up) → (-8, 3)
- door is at (7 left, 3 up) → (-7, 3)
- wall at (4 left, 3 up) → (-4, 3)
- rule `is` at (1 right, 3 up) → (1, 3)
- rule `win` at (2 right, 3 up) → (2, 3)
- rule `wall` at (9 left, 2 up) → (-9, 2)
- rule `stop` at (7 left, 2 up) → (-7, 2)
- wall at (4 left, 2 up) → (-4, 2)
- rule `door` at (2 up) → (0, 2)
- wall at (4 left, 1 up) → (-4, 1)
- rule `ball` at (1 left, 1 up) → (-1, 1)
- rule `is` at (1 up) → (0, 1)
- rule `is` at (6 left) → (-6, 0)
- wall at (4 left) → (-4, 0)
- rule `win` at (1 right) → (1, 0)
- wall at (4 left, 1 down) → (-4, -1)
- rule `key` at (1 right, 1 down) → (1, -1)
- wall at (4 left, 2 down) → (-4, -2)
- rule `baba` at (9 left, 3 down) → (-9, -3) [but this is the same as the first rule? Maybe duplicated]

This is a bit messy. Let's focus on the player's position at (-8, -3). The key is at (-8, 3). So to get there, move up 6 times. But maybe there's a better way.

The goal is to reach the WIN condition. The original WIN is at (2, 3) relative to the key's position? Or where is the WIN object located? Looking back at the observation:

Objects on the map include ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"". Assuming this rule is an object that defines the WIN position. So the actual WIN object's position might be elsewhere. Wait, in Baba Is You, the WIN rule typically points to a specific tile. So the ""win"" rule is a text block that says what is WIN. For example, if there's a rule ""door is win"", then door tiles are WIN.

In the current observation, the active rule is ""baba is you"". The other rules are objects on the map. The ""win"" rule is at (2 right, 3 up) from wherever it's placed. But without knowing the reference point, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the WIN object's position might be defined by the rule. For example, if the rule is ""win is door"", then the door is the WIN. But in the current active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you"", so the WIN condition is whatever is defined by the ""win"" rule object on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"". So this rule object is positioned 2 steps right and 3 up from some origin. If this rule defines that something is WIN, then we need to find where that something is.

Alternatively, the WIN could be a specific tile on the map. Maybe the door is the WIN if we can change the rule to ""door is win"".

So the plan is to create a rule ""door is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the door and adding an ""is"" rule between them.

To do that:

1. Move to the location of the ""win"" rule (2 right, 3 up from wherever).
2. Move to the door's location.
3. Place the ""win"" rule next to the door.
4. Bring an ""is"" rule next to both to form ""door is win"".

Assuming the player is at (-8, -3), let's calculate the path.

The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from its current position. Wait, no—the observation says ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"". This is likely relative to the player's position. So from the player's position (-8, -3), the ""win"" rule is at (-8 + 2, -3 + 3) = (-6, 0).

The door is at (-7, 3). So to get from the player's position to the ""win"" rule at (-6, 0), the player needs to move right 2 and up 3. Then from there, move left 1 and up 3 to reach the door at (-7, 3).

But that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at (1 right, 3 up) from the key's position, which would be (-8 +1, 3) = (-7, 3), which is the door's position. Wait, no. The key is at (-8,3), and the ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 3 up from the key, so (-8+2,3+3)=(-6,6). That doesn't seem right. I'm probably getting the coordinates mixed up.

This is getting too complicated without a visual. Let's try a different approach. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 up from the player's position. The door is at 7 left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 3 up from wherever. Maybe the player should first move towards the ""win"" rule to pick it up, then move to the door and place the ""win"" rule next to it, along with an ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, the player can move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up, combine it with the ""win"" rule and the door to make ""door is win"".

But I need to make sure the player can move those rules. Since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", they can move objects that are not STOP. The walls are STOP, but the rules and other text blocks are likely movable.

So step-by-step:

1. Move from the player's position (-8, -3) to the ""win"" rule at (-6, 0) (assuming that's the correct coordinate).
   - To get there: move right 2 (from -8 to -6) and up 3 (from -3 to 0). So actions: right, right, up, up, up.

2. Once at the ""win"" rule, move left to be next to the door. The door is at (-7, 3). So from (-6, 0), move left 1 (to -7, 0), then up 3 (to -7, 3), which is the door's position.

3. Now, place the ""win"" rule next to the door. Since the door is at (-7,3), the ""win"" rule can be placed to the right of it (at -6,3) or above/below. But to form ""door is win"", the ""win"" rule needs to be adjacent. So move the ""win"" rule from (-7,3) to (-6,3), which is next to the door.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and manipulate text blocks. The goal is probably to reach the door or the win condition. Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and up, and a door slightly to the left and up. There are also some text blocks labeled 'is', 'win', 'wall', and 'stop' scattered around.

First, I need to see if I can reach any of the text blocks to change the rules. The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that 'win' block to be under Baba, maybe I can make Baba the win condition. But right now, Baba is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's pretty far. Maybe there's a way to move him closer or manipulate the 'win' rule.

There's also a 'key' that's 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe it opens the door? The door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. But the door is a 'door' object, and the active rule is still 'baba is you', so I can move through it unless there's a 'stop' rule. Looking at the objects, there are 'stop' rules at 7 steps left and 2 steps up, and 4 steps left and 3 steps up. So the door might be blocked by a wall or a stop. Wait, the door is at 7 left, 3 up, and there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up. That's not directly in the way, but maybe the path is blocked by other walls.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the 'wall' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 9 left, 2 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove a wall blocking my path. But to move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a 'stop' or similar. The 'is' rule is at 3 step up, which might be useful. If I can pick up an 'is' block and place it to create a new rule.

Wait, the 'baba' text block is at 9 left, 3 down. So if I can move that 'baba' to somewhere else, like next to the 'you' rule, then I could make 'baba is you' again, but I already have that rule. Maybe the goal is to make 'baba is win' or 'baba is key'. Let me check the objects again.

The 'win' rule is at 2 right and 3 up from the current position. If I can move that 'win' block to be under Baba, then touching it would make me win. But how to get there. My current position isn't clear, but the key is at 8 left, 3 up. Maybe I need to go get the key first, but the key is behind some walls?

Alternatively, the 'is' rule at 3 step up. If I can move that 'is' to create a new rule like 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to be next to the 'baba' text block and the 'win' rule. The 'baba' is at 9 left, 3 down. The 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 up from wherever I am now. Maybe I need to move up to reach the 'win' rule and then place the 'is' between 'baba' and 'win'.

But how do I move the 'is' block? I have to be adjacent to it. The 'is' block is at 3 step up. If I move up three steps, I can get to it. Then pick it up and carry it to where the 'baba' and 'win' are. But there might be stops or walls in the way. Let's see the path.

From the current position (assuming I'm at the same location as the 'baba' text block, which is 9 left, 3 down), moving up three steps would take me to 9 left, 0 down (which is up). The 'is' rule is at 3 step up, so that's reachable. Then, moving right to the 'win' rule which is 1 step right and 3 up. Wait, if I'm at the 'is' block at 3 step up, then moving right would get me towards the 'win' rule. But need to check if the path is blocked.

There's a 'stop' rule at 7 left, 2 up. So if I'm moving from 9 left, 3 up (the 'is' block) to the 'win' at 2 right and 3 up, that would be moving right two steps. But there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up. So if I'm at 9 left, 3 up, moving right two steps would take me to 7 left, 3 up, which is a wall. That blocks the path. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' block to the 'baba' location. If I can get the 'is' next to 'baba', then create 'baba is win' by placing 'win' next to it. But the 'win' rule is at 2 right and 3 up from the original position. Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.

The 'key' is at 8 left, 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it on the door. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. So moving from the key's position (8 left, 3 up) to the door (7 left, 3 up) is one step left. But the door is a 'door' object. If the rule is 'baba is you', then touching the door might not do anything unless 'door' is a win condition. But the active rule is still 'baba is you', so unless 'win' is changed, touching the door won't help.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to make 'key is win', so picking up the key makes it the win condition. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'is' block to create 'key is win'. The 'key' is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the current 'is' block at 3 step up. Let's see: current 'is' is at 3 step up. If I move right to the key's position (which is 1 step right and 1 step down from the 'is' block?), maybe. Wait, the key is 1 step right and 1 step down from where? The observation lists the key as ""rule `key` 2 steps to the right and 1 step down"". Wait, the exact positions are a bit confusing. Maybe I need to parse the positions more carefully.

Looking at the objects:

- key is 8 step to the left and 3 step up
- door is 7 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` is 3 step up
- rule `win` is 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- rule `ball` is 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` is 6 step to the left
- rule `win` is 1 step to the right
- rule `key` is 1 step to the right and 1 step down

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' text block: 9 step to the left and 3 steps down.

So from Baba's position (9L, 3D):

- To the left: 8L, 3D (wall)
- To the right: 10L, 3D (not sure)
- Up: 9L, 2D
- Down: 9L, 4D

The 'is' rule is at 3 step up, which would be 9L, 0D (up three steps).
The 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 up: 10L, 0D.
The 'key' is at 8L, 3U (8 left, 3 up from Baba's position? Wait, the key is ""8 step to the left and 3 step up"" from Baba. So if Baba is at 9L, 3D, then the key is at 9L -8 = 1L, 3D -3U = 0U. So position 1L, 0U.

The 'door' is at 7L, 3U from Baba, so 9L-7=2L, 3D-3U=0U. So door at 2L, 0U.

The 'stop' rules are at 7L, 2U and 4L, 3U.

So the path from key (1L, 0U) to door (2L, 0U) is one step right, but there's a 'stop' at 7L, 2U which is not in the way. Wait, the 'stop' at 7L, 2U is further left and up. So moving right from key to door is possible unless there's a wall. There's a wall at 4L, 3U, but that's up and to the right. So maybe the path is clear.

But how to get the key. To get the key at 1L, 0U, Baba needs to move left from 9L, 3D to 1L, 0U. But moving left eight steps? That's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Wait, the key is 8 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba. So from Baba's position (9L, 3D), moving left 8 steps gets to 1L, 3D, then up 3 steps to 1L, 0U. But there might be walls in the way. For example, the wall at 4L, 3U is at 4L, 0D (since 3U from Baba's 3D is 0D). So moving left from 9L to 1L, passing through 4L, which has a wall. So that path is blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe instead of getting the key, focus on manipulating the rules. The 'is' rule at 3 step up (9L, 0D). If I can move that 'is' to create a new rule. For example, 'baba is win' by placing 'win' next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' rule is at 10L, 0D (1 step right from the 'is' block). So if I can move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win', then combining them would make the rule.

Baba is at 9L, 3D. To get the 'is' block at 9L, 0D, then move down to 9L, 3D (Baba's position). But how to place the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'win' is at 10L, 0D. So if I move the 'is' from 9L,0D to 8L,0D (left one step), then place it next to 'baba' at 9L,3D? Not sure. Maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, the 'is' block at 3 step up (9L,0D). If I can move it down to be next to Baba. Moving down three steps from 9L,0D brings me to 9L,3D, which is Baba's position. But I can't place the 'is' there because Baba is ocupied. Maybe move the 'is' block next to Baba and then add 'win' next to it.

Another idea: The 'you' rule is at 7L,3D (3 steps down from Baba's 9L,3D). If I can make 'baba is you' again, but that's already the case. Maybe change 'you' to 'win' so that touching 'you' makes me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block to create 'you is win'. The 'you' rule is at 7L,3D. The 'win' rule is at 10L,0D. So moving the 'is' block from 9L,0D to 7L,3D (4 steps left and 3 steps down) seems impossible due to walls and stops.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to move the 'is' block towards the 'key' or 'door' to create a new rule. For example, 'key is win' so that picking up the key makes me win. The 'key' is at 1L,0U. The 'win' is at 10L,0D. So to make 'key is win', I need to move 'is' between them. But the distance is too big.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' at 3 step up (9L,0D) to create 'baba is win' by placing 'win' next to it. The 'win' is at 10L,0D. So if I can move the 'is' to 9L,0D (which it already is) and then move right to 10L,0D (the 'win') and place the 'is' there, but that wouldn't make sense. Maybe the correct way is to have 'baba is win' by having 'win' next to 'baba' and 'is' in between.

Baba is at 9L,3D. The 'win' is at 10L,0D. The 'is' is at 9L,0D. So if I can move the 'is' from 9L,0D to 8L,0D (left), then place 'win' next to 'baba' at 9L,3D. Not sure. Maybe this isn't the right path.

Wait, maybe the solution is simpler. Since 'baba is you', I can push objects. For example, if there's a 'stop' rule, I can't push past it. But maybe there's a way to move a wall or another object to create a path. The 'wall' rule is at 9L,2U. If I can create a 'wall' somewhere else to block the path of a 'stop', but that might not help.

Alternatively, the door is a 'door' object. If I can change the rule to 'door is you', then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block to create 'door is you'. The 'door' is at 7L,3U (2L,0U from Baba). The 'you' rule is at 7L,3D (same column as Baba). So maybe move the 'is' block to 7L,3D (Baba's position) and then place 'door' next to it. But this seems complicated.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to focus on the immediate objects. The 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 up from the 'is' block. If I can get the 'is' block next to the 'win' rule and place it next to Baba, then 'baba is win' would be active. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'is' block at 3 step up (9L,0D).
2. Pick up the 'is' block.
3. Move right to the 'win' rule at 10L,0D.
4. Place the 'is' block between Baba and 'win', creating 'baba is win'.

But to do this, I need to be able to move right from the 'is' block's position. From 9L,0D, moving right would take me to 10L,0D, which is the 'win' rule. Then placing the 'is' there would create the rule. But I need to ensure that the path is clear. There's a 'stop' at 7L,2U, which is not in the way. The wall at 4L,3U is also not in the path. So maybe this is possible.

So the actions would be:

- Move up three times to reach the 'is' block.
- Pick up the 'is' block.
- Move right once to the 'win' rule.
- Place the 'is' block between Baba and 'win', effectively creating 'baba is win'.

Then, simply moving towards the 'win' condition (which is now Baba) would make me win. But since 'baba is win', touching Baba would make me win. So maybe I just need to stay in place once the rule is set.

But how to execute this step by step. Let's see:

Current position: Assume I'm at Baba's position (9L,3D).

First action: up (to 9L,2D)
Second action: up (to 9L,1D)
Third action: up (to 9L,0D) - now at the 'is' block.
Fourth action: interact (pick up the 'is' block).
Fifth action: right (move to 10L,0D - the 'win' rule's position).
Sixth action: interact (place the 'is' block next to 'win' and Baba).

But placing the 'is' block next to 'win' would create 'win is [something]'. Wait, no. The correct placement would be to have 'baba' [is] 'win'. Since Baba is at 9L,3D, and 'win' is at 10L,0D, placing the 'is' between them isn't possible. Maybe I need to place the 'is' next to Baba and then next to 'win'.

Alternatively, after picking up the 'is', move down to Baba's position and place the 'is' there, but that's occupied. This is confusing.

Maybe a better approach is to move the 'win' rule next to Baba using the 'is' block. For example, create 'baba is win' by having the 'win' rule adjacent to Baba with 'is' in between. Since 'win' is at 10L,0D and Baba is at 9L,3D, they are not adjacent. So this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, use the existing 'win' rule that's 1 step right and 3 up from the 'is' block. If I can move the 'is' block to create 'baba is win', but I'm not sure how.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe","

47,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move around and manipulate text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed.

Looking at the objects, there's a key and a door. The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. The door is 7 steps left and 3 up. So maybe I need to get the key to open the door? But how?

There are several ""is"" rules scattered around. Rule `is` is 3 steps up, and there's another `is` at 6 steps left. Also, `win` is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Maybe I can move the `win` rule somewhere else? Or change what defines `win`.

Wait, the rules ""wall"" and ""stop"" are also present. The walls are at various positions, some marked as stop. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls unless they have a ""stop"" property. But right now, the walls are defined as `wall is wall`, so they're solid.

The `key` is near a rule `key` at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe if I move the `key` rule to the key object, then I can pick up the key? But how do I move rules? I can only move objects or text that aren't ""stop"" or similar. The `is` rules aren't stop, so maybe I can move them.

The `you` rule is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down, next to a `baba` rule. If I can make ""baba"" be ""win,"" that might work. For example, if I can write ""baba is win"" by moving existing `is` and `win` rules. Let me check the positions.

There's a `win` rule at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that `win` next to the `baba` rule (which is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down), that might create ""baba is win."" But how to get there? The `is` rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. Maybe move the `is` next to `baba`, then place `win` next to that.

Alternatively, maybe the `door` can be turned into a `win` by redefining it. There's a `door` rule at 2 steps up. If I can make ""door is win,"" then standing on the door would win. But the door is behind a wall (wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up), so I need to get past that.

Wait, the key is at 8 left, 3 up. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. So the door is one step to the right of the key. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock the door? But how to interact with the key? Since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, perhaps moving the `key` rule to the key object allows me to pick it up, but I'm not sure how that works in the game.

Another approach: The `win` rule is already present. If I can move it to a different location, like next to Baba, then touching that would make me win. The `win` is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that `win` rule to where I am (Baba's position at 9 left, 3 down), that might not be possible because moving the rule would require navigating around walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can redefine ""win"" to be something else. For example, if I create ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba (which is me) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `is` and `win` rules next to the `baba` text block. The `is` is at 8 left, 3 down, and `win` is at 2 steps right and 3 up. That's a bit far. Maybe moving the `is` down to the `baba` location and placing `win` next to it.

Looking at the current positions:

- `baba` rule is at 9 left, 3 down.
- `is` rule is at 8 left, 3 down (adjacent to `baba`'s rule?).
- `win` rule is at 1 right, 3 up.

If I can move the `is` from 8 left, 3 down to be next to `baba` at 9 left, 3 down, then place `win` next to that `is`, forming ""baba is win."" The `is` is already adjacent to `baba`, so maybe moving the `win` rule down to be next to the `is`.

The `win` rule is at 1 right and 3 up from the original position. Wait, the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again.

Original observation:

- `rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up` from where? Maybe from Baba's position. Assuming Baba is at a certain point, but the exact starting point isn't clear. Alternatively, the positions are relative to the player's current location.

But perhaps the key is to move the `win` rule closer to the player. The `win` rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the current position. If I move down three steps, I could reach that `win` rule. Then, move it left next to the `is` and `baba` rules.

So actions would be:

1. Move down three times to reach the `win` rule.
2. Move left to place it next to the `is` and `baba` rules, forming ""baba is win.""

But need to check if the path is clear. There are walls at various positions. For example, wall at 4 left, 3 up. If moving down, need to avoid walls. Let's see:

The player is likely at 9 left, 3 down (since the `baba` rule is there). To get to the `win` rule at 1 right and 3 up, that would be 10 left, 0 down? Not sure. Alternatively, the coordinates are relative. This is getting complicated.

Another angle: The door is at 7 left, 3 up. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. So between the door and key is a wall at 4 left, 3 up. Wait, no, the walls are at 4 left, 3 up; 4 left, 2 up; etc. So the path from the key to the door is blocked by walls. Maybe need to rearrange rules to make the walls passable.

If I can change a wall to a stop or something else, but that might not help. Alternatively, using the key to unlock the door, but I don't know how that works in the game. Maybe moving the `door` rule to be `key` or something.

Alternatively, since the player is Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe touching the door is the win condition, but the door is a `stop` because of the `door is stop` rule. Wait, there's a `rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up`, which might be affecting the door.

This is quite tricky. Let me try to focus on the immediate actions. The `win` rule is nearby. If I can move it to where I am, that would be ideal. So:

- Move up three times to reach the `win` rule (since it's 3 steps up).
- Then move left to place it next to the `is` and `baba` rules.

But how to navigate the path. Are there walls blocking the way up? The `wall` at 4 left, 3 up could be in the way. If I have to move around it, perhaps move right first, then up.

Alternatively, use the `is` rules to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the existing `is` and `win` rules together.

Another thought: The `key` is at 8 left, 3 up. If I can get the `key`, maybe I can use it to unlock something. But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push objects or text blocks, but not necessarily pick up keys. The key might need to be on the same tile as the player to be collected.

So, maybe the steps are:

1. Move right to reach the `key` rule at 1 step right and 1 step down (from the current position?).
Wait, the `key` object is at 8 step left and 3 step up. The `rule `key`` is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm, perhaps the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This is confusing without a map.

Alternatively, the player is at a central position, and all objects are located relative to that. The `baba` rule is at 9 left and 3 down, which is probably the player's position because ""baba is you.""

So, to get to the `key` object at 8 left, 3 up, the player would need to move left once and up three times. But there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up, which might block that path.

Alternatively, move around the wall by going right, then up, then left. But the player is at 9 left, 3 down. Moving right would go to 8 left, 3 down. Then up to 8 left, 2 down, then up again to 8 left, 1 down, then up to 8 left, 0 down (which is 3 up from the original position). But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the walls:

- wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up: So at 4 left, 3 up from the player's position.
- wall 4 left, 2 up.
- wall 4 left, 1 up.
- wall 4 left, same level (3 down? Not sure).

This suggests that from the player's position (9 left, 3 down), moving left to 8 left, 3 down (which is where the `is` rule is), then up to 8 left, 2 down, etc., but the wall at 4 left, 3 up is further left. So the path to the key at 8 left, 3 up might be blocked by nothing, since 8 left is still to the right of the wall at 4 left.

Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that moving left decreases the x-coordinate, and up increases the y-coordinate. So the player is at (9, 3). The key is at (8, 3) left and up—wait, the description says ""key 8 step to the left and 3 step up."" So from the player's position (9,3), moving left 8 steps would be to (1,3), and up 3 steps to (1,6). But that seems too far. Maybe the coordinates are relative, and the numbers indicate direction and distance.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best approach is to try to move the `win` rule next to `baba` by moving down to where the `win` is located and then placing it adjacent.

So, action sequence:

1. Move up three times to reach the `win` rule at 1 step right and 3 up. Wait, the `win` rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the player's current position. If the player is at (0,0), then the `win` is at (1,3). To get there, move up three times, then right once.

But need to check if the path is clear. Between the player and the `win` rule, are there walls? The walls are at 4 left, 3 up, which would be (4,3) if the player is at (0,0). So moving right to (1,3) wouldn't hit that wall.

Once at (1,3), pick up the `win` rule and move it left to place it next to the `is` rule at (8,3 down), but this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, since the `is` rule is adjacent to `baba`, moving the `win` rule next to them would create ""baba is win."" So the steps would be:

- Move down to the `is` rule's location (8 left, 3 down).
- Then move the `win` rule from (1 right, 3 up) to be next to the `is`.

But how to move the `win` rule there? Need to navigate over the `door` rule at 2 step up, which might be a stop.

This is really challenging without seeing the actual map layout. Given the previous actions and the fact that the assistant kept moving up and right, maybe the correct action now is to finally move the `win` rule into position.

Given that the last few actions were up and right, perhaps the next step is to move the `win` rule left next to `baba` and `is`. So the action would be to move left from the `win` rule's position to place it adjacent.

But based on the observation, the `win` rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the player. So if the player is moving up three times to get to the `win`, then left to place it.

Alternatively, since the assistant kept getting stuck, maybe the correct action is to finally move the `win` rule left next to the `is` and `baba`.

So the chosen action is to move left.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can move around and interact with objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and a door also to the left. The win rule is to the right and up. But there are walls blocking the way. The walls are defined by ""wall is stop,"" so they're immovable. Hmm. So I need to find a way to get past the walls.

Wait, the key is 7 steps left and 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe that opens the door? The door is at 6 left and 3 up, same row as the key. But there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up. How do I get past that?

The rule ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from where I'm currently. But the path is blocked by a wall. Maybe I can rearrange the rules. There are some ""is"" rules floating around. For example, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" If I can move that ""is"" rule next to another rule, maybe I can create a new rule.

Like, if I take the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up and move it next to the ""key"" rule, that could make ""key is win,"" changing the win condition. Or maybe move it to make ""wall is not stop,"" but I don't know if that's possible.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" I can move the ""is"" text block. Let's see: the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I move it to be next to ""baba"" and ""you,"" maybe I can create ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Hmm.

Wait, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 6 left and 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you,"" but that's already active. Maybe I need to change the win condition. The current win is a door, but maybe if I make ""win is door,"" which it already is. Or ""win is key,"" so picking up the key would make me win.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to the key. If ""win is key,"" then touching the key would make me win. So I need to move the ""win"" rule (which is at 2 steps right and 3 up) next to the key (7 left, 3 up). The positions are a bit far apart. Let me visualize the map.

Current position of ""win"" is 2 right and 3 up from some reference point. The key is 7 left and 3 up. So they're in the same vertical line but 9 steps apart horizontally. That's too far to move the ""win"" rule there directly. Maybe another approach.

What if I use the ""key"" to interact with something? The door is at 6 left and 3 up. If I can move the key to the door and use it to unlock, but in Baba Is You, using the key usually involves pushing it next to the door. However, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can move the key towards the door. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules to make the door passable. If I can change ""door is stop"" to something else. There's a ""rule `door` 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" If I can move that ""door"" rule next to another object, maybe change its property. For example, making ""door is win"" so the door itself becomes the win condition. Then I just need to reach the door.

But how to move those rules? The ""is"" rules are scattered. Let's see: there's an ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up. If I move that ""is"" next to the ""door"" rule at 1 step to the right and 1 step up, maybe I can make ""door is win."" Let's check the positions.

The ""door"" rule is at 1 right and 1 up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. If I move the ""is"" down two steps to be adjacent to the ""door"" rule, then combining them would create ""door is win."" That could work. So the steps would be: move down to get to the ""is"" rule, then move left or right to be adjacent to the ""door"" rule, then create the new rule ""door is win.""

Once that's done, reaching the door would make me win. So the plan is:

1. Move down to the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up.
2. Move down again to get to the ""door"" rule at 1 right and 1 up.
3. Position the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule and create ""door is win.""
4. Then move left to the door and touch it to win.

But I need to check the current positions again. Let me parse the observation again.

Current active rules: baba is you.

Objects:
- key at 7 left, 3 up
- door at 6 left, 3 up
- wall at 4 left, 3 up
- rule `is` at 1 right, 3 up
- rule `win` at 2 right, 3 up
- rule `wall` at 8 left, 2 up
- rule `stop` at 6 left, 2 up
- wall at 4 left, 2 up
- rule `door` at 1 right, 2 up
- wall at 4 left, 1 up
- rule `ball` at 1 left, 1 up
- rule `is` at 1 right, 1 up
- rule `is` at 5 left
- wall at 4 left
- rule `win` at 2 right
- wall at 4 left, 1 down
- rule `key` at 2 right, 1 down
- wall at 4 left, 2 down
- rule `baba` at 8 left, 3 down
- rule `is` at 7 left, 3 down
- rule `you` at 6 left, 3 down
- wall at 4 left, 3 down

So the ""is"" rule I'm interested in is at 1 right, 3 up. The ""door"" rule is at 1 right, 2 up. Wait, no: the ""rule `door`"" is at 1 step to the right and 2 step up. So maybe the positions are:

Assuming the player is at a certain point, but perhaps the coordinates are relative. Maybe the key is 7 steps left from the player, door 6 left, etc. But regardless, the key is to the left, the door is to the left, and the ""is"" rule is to the right and up.

To move the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up to be next to the ""door"" rule at 1 right, 2 up, I need to move the ""is"" rule down one step. So from 3 up to 2 up. Then, since both are at 1 right, they would be adjacent vertically. Then combining them would create ""door is win.""

So the actions would be:

1. Move down from the current position to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up.
Wait, but the player's position isn't explicitly given. The objects are described relative to the player, I think. So ""key 7 step to the left and 3 step up"" means the key is 7 steps left and 3 up from the player's current position.

In that case, the ""is"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up from the player. To get to it, the player would need to move right once, then up three times. But moving up three times would take the player to the ""is"" rule. However, the path might be blocked.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up. But the player is at 0 left, 0 up maybe. So moving right 1 and up 3 would place the player at (1,3), where the ""is"" rule is. Are there any walls along that path? Between the player and the ""is"" rule, there's nothing mentioned. The walls are at 4 left, which is far to the left, so not on the path.

So moving right then up three times would reach the ""is"" rule. Then, from there, move down to the ""door"" rule which is at 1 right, 2 up. So from (1,3) move down to (1,2), which is the ""door"" rule's position. Then, since the ""is"" rule is now adjacent to the ""door"" rule, combining them would create ""door is win.""

Once that rule is active, the door becomes the win object. Then the player can move left to the door (which is at 6 left, 3 up) but wait, the player is at (1,2) after moving. The door is at 6 left, 3 up from the player's original position. So from (1,2), moving left 5 steps and up 1 step would reach the door. But there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up, which blocks that path.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, after changing the rule to ""door is win,"" the player can move left towards the door, hoping the wall is no longer a problem. But the wall is still there as ""wall is stop."" Unless we changed that.

Alternatively, maybe create a rule that makes the wall passable. For example, move an ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""stop"" to change it. But there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 8 left, 2 up and ""rule `stop`"" at 6 left, 2 up. If I can move an ""is"" rule between them, maybe change ""wall is stop"" to something else.

But this seems more complex. Let's focus back on the original plan. If I make ""door is win,"" then touching the door would win. The problem is reaching the door without being blocked by the wall at 4 left, 3 up. From the player's original position, moving left 6 steps and up 3 would reach the door, but the wall at 4 left, 3 up is in the way. So maybe need to destroy the wall or make it passable.

Wait, the wall's rule is ""wall is stop."" If I can change ""stop"" to something else, like ""push"" or remove it. But how? There's a ""rule `stop`"" at 6 left, 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else or replace it.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the wall if it's not defined as stop. But the wall is defined as stop, so it's immovable. So I need to change the rule defining the wall as stop.

If I can take the ""is"" rule and move it to reassign the wall's property. For example, move the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and ""push,"" making ""wall is push."" Then the wall would be pushable. But where is the ""push"" rule? I don't see a ""push"" rule in the active rules. So that might not be possible.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""wall is you,"" but that would mean the wall can be moved, which might not help. Or ""wall is win,"" but that's not useful here.

This is getting tricky. Let's recap:

- Need to reach the door or make key the win condition.
- Changing ""door is win"" seems promising.
- To do that, need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule.
- Steps: move right and up to the ""is"" rule, then down to be next to ""door"" rule.
- Once done, door is win, so move left to door.

But how to get past the wall at 4 left, 3 up? If the player is at (1,2) after moving, then to reach the door at 6 left, 3 up from original position, which is ( -5 left, 3 up ) relative to the player's new position at (1,2). So from (1,2), moving left 5 steps and up 1 step would reach the door. But the wall is at 4 left, 3 up from original, which is ( -3 left, 3 up ) relative to the player's new position. So the path from (1,2) to (-5,-1) (door) would pass through ( -3,-1 ), which is the wall at 4 left, 3 up. So blocked.

Hmm. So even if door is win, can't reach it because of the wall. So need to remove the wall or make it passable.

Alternative idea: use the key to unlock the door. In Baba Is You, usually you push the key to the door. But since I'm Baba, maybe I can move the key towards the door. The key is at 7 left, 3 up from original. So from the player's original position, the key is to the left. To move the key, I need to push it, but it's defined as a normal object unless rules say otherwise. Since there's no rule saying key is stop, it can be moved.

So steps:

1. Move left to get the key.
2. Push the key towards the door.
3. Once the key is next to the door, maybe the door opens, or the key's presence makes you win.

But the active rules don't have ""key is win,"" so just having the key might not be enough. However, if I can create a rule like ""key is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the key.

The ""win"" rule is at 2 right, 3 up from original position. The key is at 7 left, 3 up. So they're in the same vertical line but 9 steps apart. Not feasible to move the ""win"" rule there directly.

Alternatively, move the key to the ""win"" rule's position. But the path is blocked by walls.

This seems challenging. Maybe another approach: create a rule that makes Baba equivalent to the door, so touching the door makes you win. For example, ""baba is door,"" then wherever Baba is, it's a door and thus a win condition.

To do that, need to create ""baba is door"" rule. There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 8 left, 3 down. And a ""rule `door`"" at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move an ""is"" rule between them.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. From there, move down to 1 right, 2 up (next to ""door"" rule), then create ""door is baba""? Wait, no. Need to make ""baba is door.""

So perhaps move the ""baba"" rule to be adjacent to ""door"" and ""is."" The ""baba"" rule is at 8 left, 3 down. That's far away. Not practical.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up. Move it to be next to ""baba"" and ""door."" But the positions are too far apart.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to go back to the initial idea of making ""door is win"" and then find a way around the wall.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the wall passable by redefining ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left, 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away or change it.

For example, move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""none"" or something. But there's no ""none"" rule here. Alternatively, move ""stop"" to a different position so the rule is broken.

But how? The ""stop"" rule is a text block that says ""stop."" To remove its effect, you'd need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 8 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop.

So steps:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 8 left, 2 up.
2. Move it somewhere else, breaking the rule.
3. Then walls are no longer stop, so can be pushed or passed.

But how to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. It's a text block, so if it's not defined as stop, it can be moved. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" makes walls stop. If I remove that rule, walls are just normal.

So to do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule off the board or rearrange it. For example, move the ""wall"" part to another position, breaking the rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of ""wall"" and ""stop"" text blocks placed next to each other. To break it, I need to separate them.

The ""wall"" part of the rule is at 8 left, 2 up, and the ""stop"" part is at 6 left, 2 up. So they're adjacent horizontally. If I can move one of them, the rule is broken.

For example, move the ""stop"" rule (at 6 left, 2 up) down one step, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer connected.

To do that, the player would need to navigate to the ""stop"" rule, which is at 6 left, 2 up. From the player's original position, that's 6 steps left and 2 up. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 left, 3 up and others. So navigating there might be difficult.

Alternatively, use existing ""is"" rules to manipulate the ""wall is stop"" rule.

There's an ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""wall is stop"" components to recreate a different rule.

This is getting too involved. Maybe the best immediate action is to focus on creating ""door is win"" and then see how to reach the door.

So, the next step is to move the ""is"" rule at 1 right, 3 up down to be next to the ""door"" rule at 1 right, 2 up. To do that, the player needs to move right once (to reach 1 right, 0 up), then up three times to get to 1 right, 3 up. Then move down once","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this level. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the environment by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and a door also to the left. The ""win"" rule is positioned 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's also a ""key"" rule down to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock the door? But how?

Wait, since ""baba is you,"" I can move any text blocks that aren't ""stop"" or similar. The ""is"" rules are movable. Let's see the positions:

- The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall 3 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different position? Or change the ""win"" condition.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a rule that makes Baba pushable or something. For example, if I can change ""baba"" to be ""push,"" then I could move other objects. But how?

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up. If I move that ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" text block that's 9 steps left and 3 steps down, maybe I can make ""baba"" have a new property. Let's see: the ""baba"" is at 9 left, 3 down. There's an ""is"" rule at 8 left, 3 down. If I move that ""is"" to be next to ""baba,"" then I could create a new rule like ""baba is push"" or something else.

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? The user is currently at position 4 left, 3 up (since the key is 8 left, 3 up, and the player must be near there). To get to the ""baba"" at 9 left, 3 down, I need to move left and down. But there are walls in the way. Let me check the path.

From the current position (assuming the player is at 4 left, 3 up), moving left would take me to 3 left, 3 up, but there's a wall there. So I can't go straight left. Maybe I need to go around. Let's see:

If I move up to the ""win"" rule at 1 right, 3 up, then maybe I can move the ""is"" rule from there. But the ""is"" is at 3 step up. So moving up once gets me to the ""is"" rule. Then I can take that ""is"" rule and move it down to the ""baba"" location.

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 3 step up. If I move up from the player's position (4 left, 3 up), moving up again would take me to 4 left, 4 up, but there's no object there. Wait, the key is at 8 left, 3 up, and the door at 7 left, 3 up. So maybe the player is somewhere in between.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the ""win"" rule, which is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Let me check the map again.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map based on the observations.

The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. So if I consider the player's position as a reference point, maybe the player is at (0,0), and the key is at (-8, 3). The door is at (-7, 3). The ""win"" rule is at (1, 3). There's an ""is"" rule at (4,3). Wait, no—the ""is"" rule is 3 steps up, so if the player is at (0,0), then 3 steps up is (0,3). But the ""is"" rule is at 3 step up, which would be (0,3). But in the observation, the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 step up, so that's (1,3).

So the player is probably at (0,0), and the ""is"" rule is at (1,3). The ""win"" rule is at (2,3). The ""key"" rule is at (2, -1). The ""baba"" text block is at (-9, -3).

To reach the ""win"" rule, I need to get from (0,0) to (2,3). But there's a wall at (-3,3), blocking the path to the left. So maybe I need to find another way. Alternatively, change the ""win"" condition to something else that's reachable.

Alternatively, create a rule that allows Baba to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba"" be ""not stop,"" but I need to find the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (-7, 2). To move that, I need to get to that position. But moving there requires navigating around walls.

Alternatively, take the ""is"" rule at (1,3) and move it to combine with another text block. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"" or ""baba is win,"" that might help. Let's see where ""baba"" is located. The ""baba"" text block is at (-9,-3), which is 9 steps left and 3 steps down from the player's position (0,0). There's an ""is"" rule at (-8,-3), so if I move that ""is"" next to ""baba,"" I can create a new rule. For example, move the ""is"" from (-8,-3) to (-9,-3), making ""baba is [something]"". But what's the ""something"" here? There's a ""you"" rule at (-7,-3), so maybe combining ""baba is you"" again, but that's the original rule.

Wait, the active rule is already ""baba is you."" So maybe I need to create a new rule that gives Baba the ability to move through walls or push objects. For that, I might need to manipulate other text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""rule `ball`"" at (-1,1). If I can make ""baba is ball,"" then maybe I can interact with the ball. But I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, if I can make ""key is win,"" then grabbing the key would make me win. But the ""key"" rule is at (2,-1), and the ""win"" rule is at (2,3). So moving the ""key is win"" rule together.

Alternatively, the goal is to reach the original ""win"" rule at (2,3), but there's a wall at (-3,3). So maybe I need to remove the wall's ""stop"" property. The ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away or change it, then the wall wouldn't be stoppable.

But how? To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" is at (-7,2). The player is at (0,0), so the path to (-7,2) is blocked by walls. Maybe moving some ""is"" rules to create new rules that allow traversal.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""wall is nothing"" or ""wall is not stop."" But that would require manipulating the ""wall"" rule, which is at (-9,2). The ""wall"" rule is 8 steps left and 2 steps up from the player's position (0,0), so at (-8,2). Wait, no—the ""wall"" rule is at 9 step to the left and 2 step up, so that's (-9,2).

This is getting really complex. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule from (1,3) to somewhere to create a new rule. For example, move it to (2,3) next to the ""win"" rule, making ""win is [something]"". But what's the something? There's a ""rule `win`"" at (2,3), so maybe combining them doesn't help.

2. Move the ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" location at (-9,-3). The ""is"" is at (-8,-3), so moving it one step left to (-9,-3) next to ""baba"". Then I can create a new rule like ""baba is [something]"". What's available there? The ""you"" rule is at (-7,-3), so maybe ""baba is you"" again, which is redundant.

3. Alternatively, take the ""is"" rule at (1,3) and move it down to combine with the ""key"" rule at (2,-1). But that's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

4. Another idea: The ""door"" is at (-7,3). If I can make the door a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the door. The door's position is (-7,3), and the ""win"" rule is at (2,3). Not adjacent. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule left to be next to the door. But the player would need to move the ""win"" rule, which requires being adjacent to it.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at (1 right, 3 up) from the player's position (0,0). So the player is at (0,0), and the ""win"" is at (1,3). To move the ""win"" rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it. So move right once to (1,0), then up to (1,3), pick up the ""win"" rule, and then move it left to be next to the door at (-7,3). But the path from (1,3) to (-7,3) is blocked by walls. There's a wall at (-3,3), so that's a problem.

Alternatively, change the ""door"" to be a ""win"". The ""door"" rule is at (-7,2). If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the door, then the door would become win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from (1,3) to (-7,2). But that's a distance of 8 left and 1 down. The player would have to carry the ""win"" rule through the grid, avoiding walls. But there are walls at various positions, making this path difficult.

Maybe a better approach is to pick up the ""key"" first. The key is at (2,-1). To get there, the player needs to move right twice and down once. But from (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then right to (2,0), then down to (2,-1). The path seems clear. Once the key is picked up, maybe the door becomes unlockable, but in Baba Is You, doors usually require a key, but since the key's rule is separate, maybe having the key object nearby allows you to push the door or something.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at (2,-1), and the actual key object is at (8 left, 3 up) according to the initial observation. Wait, no—this is getting confusing because the coordinates might be relative. Maybe I need to reorient.

Alternatively, think about the fact that ""baba is you"" means I can move text blocks. The key is probably an object that can be moved, and if I can associate it with a rule, like ""key is win,"" then grabbing the key would make me win. But how?

The ""key"" rule is a text block that says ""key"", and the actual key object is separate. To make ""key is win"", I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" text block. The key is at (8 left,3 up), and the ""win"" rule is at (2 right,3 up). So the player would need to move the ""win"" rule all the way to the key's position, which is 10 steps left from the ""win"" rule's current position. That seems impossible due to the walls in between.

Another angle: Since ""baba is you"", maybe I can turn into the key by making ""baba is key"". Then, if I touch the key object, I win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is key"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""key"". The ""key"" rule is at (2,-1), and ""baba"" is at (-9,-3). So the player would need to move the ""is"" rule from (-8,-3) to between ""baba"" and ""key"". But that's a distance of 7 left and 4 up from the current ""is"" position. Not feasible without moving through obstacles.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, move the ""is"" at (3 step up) to combine with ""win"" and ""key"". But the ""win"" is at (2 right,3 up), and the ""key"" is at (2 right,-1). Not adjacent.

Hmm. Maybe I need to look for a way to remove the ""stop"" property from the walls. The ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the walls won't block me. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" rule and move it. The ""stop"" is at (-7,2), which is 7 steps left and 2 steps up from the player's starting position (0,0). The path there is blocked by walls at (-3,3) and others. So how to get there?

Perhaps by first creating a path by removing other rules. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then the walls wouldn't be stoppable. But to do that, I need to manipulate the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2). That requires moving the ""is"" rule next to ""wall"" and changing its property. But again, the distance is too great.

Wait, there's an ""is"" rule at (-8,-3) near the ""baba"" text block. If I move that ""is"" up to (-8,2), maybe I can combine it with the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2) to make ""wall is [something]"". For example, moving the ""is"" up to (-8,2) and then creating a rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". But ""push"" isn't a default property, so maybe not.

This is really tricky. Let me try to think of the simplest solution. The most common solution in Baba levels is to either reach the win object by changing rules or by becoming the win object. Given that ""baba is you"", maybe the solution is to make ""baba"" be ""win"" by creating the rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to both ""baba"" and ""win"".

The ""baba"" text block is at (-9,-3), and the ""win"" rule is at (2,3). The ""is"" rule needed is somewhere in between. The closest ""is"" rule is at (-8,-3) and (1,3). Maybe move the ""is"" from (1,3) down to (-8,-3). But that's a long move. Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (-8,-3) to create ""baba is [something]"" and then combine with ""win"".

Alternatively, take the ""win"" rule at (2,3) and move it left to be next to the ""baba"" text block at (-9,-3). But that's a huge distance. The player would have to carry the ""win"" rule all the way left through the grid, which is impossible due to walls.

Wait, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

From the player's position (assuming near the key area), move right to get to the ""win"" rule, then move left past the walls. But the wall at (-3,3) blocks the left path from (0,3) to (-3,3). If I can remove that wall's ""stop"" property, then I could pass through. The ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). To reach there, the player would need to move left past (-3,3), but it's blocked. So this seems stuck.

Another approach: Use the key to unlock the door. The door is at (-7,3), and the key is at (8 left,3 up). If I can move the key to the door's position, then maybe the door becomes passable. But how to move the key? Since ""baba is you"", and the key is an object, I can push it if it's not stopped. But the key's rule is at (2,-1), so unless ""key"" has a move property, I can't push it. By default, objects can't be pushed unless a rule allows it, like ""key is push"".

To make ""key is push"", I need to create that rule. The ""key"" rule is at (2,-1), and there's an ""is"" rule at (1,3). So the player would need to move the ""is"" rule from (1,3) down to (2,-1), creating ""key is push"". Then, the key can be pushed. But moving the ""is"" rule from (1,3) to (2,-1) requires a lot of steps down, which might be possible if there's a clear path.

Once the key is pushable, the player can push it to the door's position. Then, moving the door rule to be ""win"" might help. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, since the key is near the ""win"" rule, maybe grabbing the key makes the player win. In some levels, holding a key object makes you win. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. The active rule is ""baba is you"", so if I pick up the key (by moving next to it), does that make me a key? If so, then maybe the key is the win object. But I need to check if there's a ""key is win"" rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `key`"" at (2,-1), but no ""key is win"" rule. So unless I create that rule, touching the key won't make me win. So that's probably not the solution.

Given all this, the most plausible solution seems to be creating the rule ""baba is","

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate other objects. Let's look at the objects on the map.

There's a key that's 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 6 steps left and 3 steps up. Walls are blocking some paths. There are several rule blocks: 'is' at 1 step right and 3 steps up, 'win' at 2 steps right there. Another 'wall' rule to the left and 2 steps up, a 'stop' rule, and more 'is' and 'win' rules down below. 

The goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, which is probably the door or another specified object. But since the rules can be changed, maybe I need to redefine 'win' or make myself into something that can open the door. 

Looking at the positions, the key is up and to the left. To get it, I might need to move up, but there are walls. Wait, the 'is' rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that 'is' rule next to the key or another object, maybe I can change a rule. For example, if I move 'is' to make 'key' a 'win' or 'you', that might help. 

But how do I move the 'is' rule? The current active rule is 'baba is you', so I can move any object that isn't 'stop'. The 'is' rule isn't marked as stop, so I can pick it up. Let's see: the 'is' rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I move it left towards the key, maybe I can create a new rule like 'key is win' or 'key is you'. 

Alternatively, the door is at 6 steps left and 3 steps up. The 'win' rule is 2 steps right from that 'is' position. If I can move the 'win' rule to the door's location, then the door would become the win condition. But how to get there? 

Another angle: the 'baba' text block is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that 'baba' and combine it with an 'is' rule, maybe make 'baba' something else. For example, 'baba is win' would make me the win condition. 

Wait, the current active rule is 'baba is you', so I am Baba. If I can change 'baba' to be 'win' using an 'is' rule, then I would become the win condition. Let's check the positions. There's a rule 'is' at 7 steps left and 3 steps down, near the 'baba' block. If I move that 'is' rule next to the 'baba' block and say 'baba is win', then I would be win. 

So the steps could be: move down to reach the 'baba' and the 'is' rule below, then combine them to create 'baba is win'. Once that's active, stepping on myself (Baba) would make me win. 

Alternatively, moving the 'win' rule up to the door. The 'win' rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that left to align with the door, then the door becomes win. 

But how to navigate there? My current position isn't clear, but the key and door positions are left and up. Maybe moving left towards the 'is' rule at 7 steps left and 3 steps down, then up to the 'baba' block. 

So the plan is: move left to get to the 'is' rule near 'baba', then move up to combine them into 'baba is win'. That way, I become the win condition. 

The next action should be moving left or down to reach that 'is' rule. Let's see, the 'is' rule is 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If I'm currently positioned somewhere else, but based on previous actions, maybe the last move was left, leading to this position. 

Alternatively, maybe moving down to reach the 'baba' and 'is' rule below. Let's check the latest observation: after moving left, the key is now 7 steps left and 3 up, door 6 left and 3 up. The 'baba' rule is at 8 left and 3 down. The 'is' rule is at 7 left and 3 down. So if I move down from my current position (assuming I'm near the key area), I can reach the 'baba' and the 'is' rule. 

So the best action might be to move down to get to that 'is' rule and then left or up to combine with 'baba'. But since I need to output a single action, the immediate step is to move down towards the 'baba' and 'is' rule.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case might be the door or something else. Looking at the current observation, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks.

First, I need to see where the key and door are located. The key is 7 steps to the left and 4 steps up. The door is 6 steps left and 4 steps up. There's also a 'win' rule that's 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, so if I can get to that 'win' rule, maybe I can change it to something else if needed. But right now, the active rule is still 'baba is you'.

Looking at the objects, there are several 'is' rules scattered around. The key is near some 'is' blocks. Maybe I need to move an 'is' block next to the door or the win condition to change the rule. For example, if I can make 'door is win', then stepping on the door would make me win. But how do I do that?

The challenge is that I (Baba) need to move the text blocks. However, some objects are defined as 'stop', like the walls, so I can't move through them. The rule 'stop' is at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. So I have to navigate around those walls.

Let me check my current position. The key is 7 steps left and 4 up from where I am. But after moving down once, my position changed. Wait, in the latest observation, after moving down, the key is now 7 steps left and 4 steps up, door similarly adjusted. The 'win' rule is 2 steps right and 4 steps up. So if I can get to that 'win' rule, maybe I can change it.

But how to get there? Let's see the path. There's a wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up. So moving up from my current position (after moving down) might be blocked. Maybe I need to move left or right to get around.

Wait, the 'is' rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. If I can move that 'is' block next to the 'win' rule, I could create a new rule like 'win is ...' But I need to be able to move the 'is' block. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move any object that isn't 'stop'. The walls are 'stop', so I can't push them, but I can move text blocks and other objects.

So, the plan might be: move the 'is' block that's 1 step right and 4 steps up, place it next to the 'win' rule, and then add another text block to make a new rule. For example, if I can make 'win is key' or 'win is baba', then stepping on the win object would work.

Alternatively, if I can make 'baba is win', then since I'm Baba, I would be Win, and touching the win object would do nothing, but maybe there's another win condition. Hmm, not sure.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `ball` 1 step up'. Not sure if that's relevant. The key is nearby, but I need to get past the walls. The wall at 3 steps left and 3 steps up is a problem. Maybe I can move left to avoid it.

Wait, after moving down, my position might have changed. Let me visualize the map. If the key is 7 steps left and 4 up, and the door is 6 left and 4 up, maybe the layout has a path to the right. The 'win' rule is to the right of where I am, but there's a wall at 3 left and 3 up. So moving up from here might be blocked. Perhaps moving right first to get around the wall.

But how to move right? The 'key' is 2 steps right and 1 step down. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to unlock something, but I don't know if there's a lock. Alternatively, the 'door' is a win condition if I can change its rule.

Another idea: Since 'baba is you', I can move text blocks. The 'is' rule at 1 step right and 4 steps up. If I can move that 'is' next to the 'door' and add 'win' to make 'door is win', then stepping on the door would make me win. But how to get there?

Let me think step by step. Current position after moving down: the 'win' rule is 2 right and 4 up. The 'is' is 1 right and 4 up. So if I move right to get to the 'is' block, then move up to place it next to the 'door' or 'win'.

But the path might be blocked. Let's see. From my current position, moving right would take me towards the 'key' at 2 right and 1 down. Wait, the 'key' is 2 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move right twice, I can get to the key. Then, maybe move up to the 'is' block.

Alternatively, maybe moving left to get to the 'is' blocks on the left. There's an 'is' at 5 steps left and 1 step up. But that's further away.

Wait, the 'is' blocks are crucial. The goal is to create a new rule that allows me to reach the win condition. So perhaps:

1. Move the 'is' block at 1 step right and 4 steps up to be next to the 'door' (6 left, 4 up). Then make 'door is win'.

But to do that, I need to push the 'is' block from (1 right, 4 up) to (6 left, 4 up). That's a distance of 7 steps left. But I can only move one step at a time. That would take multiple moves, but maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block at 5 left and 1 up. If I can bring that next to the 'win' rule (2 right, 4 up), but that seems complicated.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', maybe I can make myself 'win' by creating a rule like 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to move 'baba' and 'win' next to an 'is' block.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `baba` 8 step to the left and 3 steps down'. So the 'baba' text block is at that position. If I can move that 'baba' text block next to an 'is' rule and then add 'win', that would make 'baba is win', making me win.

But how to get there. The 'baba' text block is 8 left and 3 down. My current position is probably near the 'key' and 'door' area. Moving left 8 steps would take me there, but that's a lot. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, use the 'is' blocks already present. The 'is' at 1 right and 4 up. If I can move that 'is' next to the 'baba' text block and then add 'win', but I don't have the 'win' text block nearby. Wait, there's a 'win' rule at 2 right and 4 up. So maybe:

- Move the 'is' block from (1 right,4 up) to be next to the 'baba' text block at (8 left,3 down). But that's a big distance. Not feasible in one move.

Hmm. Maybe another strategy. The 'key' is nearby. If I can pick up the key and use it to move something. But in Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not 'stop'. The key is a movable object. So perhaps:

1. Move to the key's location (7 left,4 up), pick it up, and then use it to push an 'is' block.

But how to get to the key. The key is 7 steps left and 4 up. From my current position (which after moving down is perhaps at the original position minus down), need to calculate the path.

Alternatively, maybe the initial position is near the 'win' rule. Let's assume that after moving down, I'm now at a position where the 'win' rule is 2 steps right and 4 up. So if I move right twice and up four times, I can reach the 'win' rule. But there's a wall at 3 left and 3 up. So moving up from here would hit the wall.

Wait, the wall at 3 left and 3 up. So if I'm at, say, position (0,0), then the wall is at (-3,3). The 'win' rule is at (2,4). The 'is' block is at (1,4). So moving right from (0,0) to (1,4) would require moving right 1, up 4. But the path is blocked by the wall at (-3,3). So maybe I need to go around the wall.

Alternatively, move left to avoid the wall. If I move left from my current position, then I can go around the wall at (-3,3). For example, move left to (-1,0), then up to (-1,3), but there's a wall at (-3,3), so maybe not.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Navigate to the 'is' block at (1,4) which is 1 step right and 4 steps up from current position.
2. Move that 'is' block next to the 'win' rule at (2,4).
3. Then create a new rule like 'win is key' or 'win is baba'.

But to move the 'is' block, I need to push it. Since I'm Baba and can move anything not 'stop', I can push the 'is' block. So from (1,4), move left to (0,4), then left again to (-1,4), etc., until it's next to the 'win' at (2,4). Wait, but that would require moving the 'is' block to the right, which might not be possible if there are walls blocking.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block from (1,4) to (2,4) by pushing it right. But is there a path? Between (1,4) and (2,4), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, at (3 left, 3 up) there's a wall, but that's at (-3,3), which is different. So from (1,4) moving right to (2,4) should be possible if there's no wall there. The objects at (2 step up) are rule `door` 1 step to the right and 2 step up. So at (2,4), there's the 'win' rule. So if I move the 'is' block from (1,4) to (2,4), placing it next to 'win', then I can make 'win is ...'.

Once the 'is' is next to 'win', I can add another text block, like 'key' or 'baba', to create the rule. For example, 'win is baba' would make me win when I step on 'win'.

So the steps would be:

- Move right to reach the 'is' block at (1,4).
- Push the 'is' block right to (2,4) next to 'win'.
- Then, find a 'baba' text block to place next to it. The 'baba' text block is at (8 left,3 down), which is quite far. Alternatively, use the 'baba' that's part of the existing rules, like the 'rule `baba`' at (8 left,3 down). But I need to move that.

Alternatively, use the 'baba' that's part of the 'baba is you' rule. Wait, the original rule is 'baba is you', which is active. So the 'baba' text block is probably part of that rule. If I can move that 'is' block next to the 'win' and then add 'baba', that would work.

But moving the 'baba' text block from (8 left,3 down) to (2,4) is a long way. That's 10 steps left and 1 step up. Not feasible in a few moves.

Alternatively, use the 'baba' that's already in the 'rule `baba`' at (8 left,3 down). If I can move that 'baba' next to the 'is' block at (2,4), then create 'win is baba'.

But again, the distance is too big. Maybe there's a closer 'baba' text block. Wait, looking at the objects, there's also a 'rule `baba`' at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. So that's further away.

Hmm. Maybe another approach. If I can make the door a win by making 'door is win'. The door is at 6 left and 4 up. The 'win' rule is at 2 right and 4 up. So the door and win are opposite each other. If I can create a rule 'door is win', then stepping on the door would make me win.

To do that, I need to move an 'is' block next to 'door' and add 'win' next to it. The 'is' block at 1 right and 4 up could be moved left to be next to the door at 6 left,4 up. That would require moving the 'is' block 7 steps left. One step at a time, but that's a lot. Maybe possible with multiple moves, but given the previous actions were failing, perhaps the system expects a different approach.

Alternatively, use the 'is' block at 5 left and 1 up. If I can move that down to be near the door and win. But not sure.

Wait, looking at the current observation after moving down:

- The 'key' is now at 7 left and 4 up.
- The 'door' is at 6 left and 4 up.
- The 'win' rule is at 2 right and 4 up.
- The 'is' rule is at 1 right and 4 up.

So the 'is' block is right next to the 'win' rule. If I can move that 'is' block to the left to be next to the 'door', then create 'door is win'.

To move the 'is' from (1 right,4 up) to (6 left,4 up), that's 7 steps left. But each move is one step. So moving left seven times. But that's tedious and might not be feasible in one attempt. However, the system might accept a series of left moves, but the previous attempts resulted in failures, so maybe there's a different way.

Alternatively, since the 'is' is already adjacent to the 'win' rule, maybe I can create a new rule by adding another text block. For example, if there's a 'door' text block nearby, I can place it next to the 'is' and 'win' to make 'door is win'.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `door`' at 1 step right and 3 step up. So the 'door' text block is at (1 right,3 up). If I can move that down to be next to the 'is' and 'win' at (1 right,4 up), then create 'door is win'.

So the steps would be:

1. Move down from the 'is' block at (1 right,4 up) to (1 right,3 up) where the 'door' text block is.
2. Push the 'door' text block up to (1 right,4 up), placing it next to the 'is' and 'win'.
3. Now the rule would be 'door is win', so stepping on the door makes me win.

But how to move the 'door' text block. Since I'm Baba, I can move it if it's not 'stop'. The 'door' itself is probably not 'stop' unless there's a 'stop' rule on it. Currently, the active rules are 'baba is you', so the door's properties depend on rules. The 'rule `door` 2 step up' might mean 'door is door' or something else, but not sure.

Assuming I can move the 'door' text block, then moving it up to the 'is' and 'win' would create the desired rule. Then, moving to the door and stepping on it would make me win.

So the actions needed would be:

- Move right to reach the 'is' block at (1 right,4 up).
- Then move down to (1 right,3 up) to get the 'door' text block.
- Push the 'door' block up to (1 right,4 up), next to 'is' and 'win'.
- Now, the rule is 'door is win', so touching the door wins.

But how to execute this step by step. Let's see:

Current position after moving down is unknown, but assuming I'm near the 'win' rule. Let's say I need to move right once to reach the 'is' block at (1 right,4 up). Then move down to (1 right,3 up) to get the 'door' block. Then move up to (1 right,4 up) and push the 'door' block left or right to be next to 'is'.

Wait, the 'door' text block is at (1 right,3 up). To get it to (1 right,4 up), I need to move it up once. Then, since it's next to the 'is' at (1 right,4 up), placing it there would form 'door is win' because the 'is' is between 'door' and 'win'.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move right to (1 right,4 up) to get to the 'is' block.
2. Move down to (1 right,3 up) to access the 'door' block.
3. Move up to (1 right,4 up) with the 'door' block.
4. Now, the 'door' block is next to the 'is' and 'win' rule, creating 'door is win'.

Once that's done, moving to the door (6 left,4 up) and stepping on it would make me win, because 'door is win' and 'baba is you' (me), so I am win.

So the actions needed are a series of moves: right, down, up, then perhaps left to position the 'door' block correctly. But the system requires choosing","

52,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects by pushing them if they're defined as movable. But I need to figure out how to reach the door or the key to progress.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key that's 7 steps to the left and 4 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. Wait, the walls are 3 steps to the left and 4 steps up, and there's also a rule for ""wall"" at 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. Since ""baba is you,"" I can probably push the walls if they're not stopped. But the rule ""stop"" is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. Hmm, maybe that's making some walls immovable?

The door is 6 steps left and 4 steps up. The ""win"" rule is next to the door, so if I can get to the door, I might win. But how? The key might be needed to unlock the door, but the door's rule is ""door"" at 1 step right and 3 steps up. There's also a ""rule `stop`"" nearby, which could prevent movement past that area.

Looking at the text blocks, there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move a ""win"" text block next to a ""door"" or ""baba,"" I could change the win condition or make the door passable. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rules to form new rules like ""door is win"" or something similar.

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" The key is 7 steps left and 4 up, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can push the walls by moving them. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects unless they're stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. If a wall is under a ""stop"" rule, it can't be moved. Let me check the positions.

The wall at 3 steps left and 4 steps up is under the ""rule `is`"" at 1 step right and 4 up. So that wall might be movable. If I can push it aside, maybe I can reach the key. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make the wall something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is stop,"" but that might not help.

Another idea: since there are multiple ""is"" rules, perhaps I can move them to form a new rule like ""key is win"" so that grabbing the key makes me win. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the key and the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 steps up from the key's current position. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the key, then ""key is win"" would become active, changing the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push it if it's not stopped. There's a ""stop"" rule at 6 left and 3 up, which might not affect the ""win"" rule directly. So maybe I can move the ""win"" rule towards the key. But how do I move it? I have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction that pushes it.

Looking at the current positions, the ""win"" rule is 2 steps right and 4 steps up from the key. So the key is to the left of the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the left by one step, placing it next to the key, then I can create the ""key is win"" rule. That would make grabbing the key result in a win.

To move the ""win"" rule left, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up. If I move up from my current position, maybe I can get next to it. But where am I right now? The initial position isn't specified, but the objects' positions are relative. Assuming I'm starting at a certain point, perhaps I need to navigate to the area where the ""win"" and ""key"" are located.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rules to form ""key is win."" There's a rule `is` at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If I can place that next to the key and the ""win"" rule, it would create ""key is win."" But the key is at 7 left and 4 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 2 right and 4 up. So the distance between them is quite large. Maybe I need to move the key closer or the ""win"" rule closer.

Another possibility: create ""door is you"" so that stepping on the door makes me win. The door is at 6 left and 4 up. If I can make the door a ""you"" object, then touching it would win. To do that, I need to form the rule ""door is you."" There's a ""you"" rule at 6 left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can move the ""you"" rule up to the door's position.

But moving the ""you"" rule would require being adjacent to it and pushing it. The ""you"" rule is at 7 left and 3 steps down. If I can move up and to the left, perhaps I can reach it. Let's see: the ""you"" rule is 7 left, 3 down. If I'm at 8 left and 3 down, moving left would get me there, but I need to navigate through the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" rules to form new rules. For example, if I can get ""door"" next to ""is"" and ""you,"" that would create ""door is you."" The ""door"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. The ""you"" rule is at 6 left and 3 down. That's quite far apart. It might be more feasible to work with the ""win"" and ""key"" first.

Let me recap the possible actions:

1. Move towards the key and try to push past the walls. But the walls might be stopped by the ""stop"" rule.
2. Try to rearrange the text blocks to create a new rule like ""key is win"" or ""door is you.""
3. Use the existing ""win"" rule next to the door to win by touching the door, but how to get there.

Given that the default action kept failing, maybe the issue is not moving towards the objects directly but instead manipulating the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push text blocks unless they're stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up, which might be affecting a wall. Let me check the walls:

- wall at 3 left,4 up: under ""is"" rule (movable)
- wall at 8 left,3 up: under ""wall"" rule (maybe immovable)
- other walls are at 3 left, various positions.

So the wall at 3 left,4 up can be moved. If I can push it aside, maybe clear a path to the key. The key is 7 left,4 up. If I move the wall at 3 left,4 up to the left, maybe blocking a different path, but that might not help. Alternatively, pushing the wall down could free up space.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a rule that makes the wall passable. For example, ""wall is push"" or ""wall is stop."" But that requires editing the existing rules.

Wait, the current rules include ""wall is you"" at 9 left,2 up. No, the rules are:

- rule `is` 3 step up
- rule `win` 1 step right,3 up
- rule `wall` 9 left,2 up
- rule `stop` 7 left,2 up
- rule `door` 2 step up
- rule `ball` 1 left,1 up
- etc.

So the ""wall"" rule is at 9 left,2 up, meaning ""wall is you""? No, the rule is ""wall is you"" would be ""wall IS YOU"", but here it's ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 2 step up"". Wait, the objects are listed as ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 2 step up"", which means the text block ""wall"" is located there. Similarly, the ""is"" rules are text blocks that when combined with others form rules.

So to create a new rule, I need to have a subject next to an ""is"" text block and a property next to another ""is"" text block. For example, if ""baba"" is next to ""is"" and ""you"" is next to another ""is"", then ""baba is you"" becomes active.

Looking at the current setup, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 9 left,3 down, next to an ""is"" rule. So ""baba is you"" is active because ""baba"" is next to an ""is"" and ""you"" is next to another ""is"" at 7 left,3 down.

To create a new rule like ""key is win"", I need the ""key"" text block next to an ""is"" and the ""win"" text block next to another ""is"". The ""key"" is at 1 right,1 down, and the ""win"" is at 2 right,4 up. There's an ""is"" rule at 1 right,1 up. If I can move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" and the ""is"" rule, that would form ""key is win"".

The ""win"" rule is currently at 2 right,4 up. To move it left, I need to be adjacent to it and push it left. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push it unless it's stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left,2 up, which might not affect the ""win"" rule. So moving the ""win"" rule left by one step would place it next to the key (if the key is at 7 left,4 up, then moving the ""win"" left would make it 6 left,4 up, still not adjacent). Wait, the key is at 7 left,4 up. The ""win"" is at 2 right,4 up, which is 9 left minus 7 left? Wait, positions are relative. Maybe the coordinate system is such that each step changes the position by one in left/right and up/down.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are relative to Baba's current location. Without knowing Baba's exact position, it's tricky, but maybe the key is to the left of the ""win"" rule. If the ""win"" rule is 2 steps to the right of the key, then moving the ""win"" rule left by two steps would place it next to the key. But that would require pushing it past other objects.

This seems complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to push the ""win"" rule closer to the key. Let's see:

The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 4 steps up from the key's position (7 left,4 up). So the ""win"" is at 5 left,4 up (7-2=5). The distance between the key and the ""win"" is 2 steps left. If I can move the ""win"" rule left by two steps, placing it next to the key, then combining with an ""is"" rule would create ""key is win"".

To move the ""win"" rule left, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""win"" rule is currently at 1 step right and 4 steps up (relative to the key's position). So to get next to it, I need to move up and to the right. But how does this translate in absolute terms?

Alternatively, maybe the key is at position (x,y), and the ""win"" rule is at (x+2, y+4). To move the ""win"" rule left, I need to move it to (x+1, y+4), then to (x, y+4). Each move would require being adjacent and pushing.

Assuming I can navigate to the ""win"" rule's location, move left twice, and place it next to the key, then use an ""is"" rule adjacent to both to form ""key is win"". This would make touching the key result in a win.

But how to get to the ""win"" rule? The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up from the key. So from the key's position, moving right and up. But there are walls in the way. The wall at 3 left,4 up is movable if I can push it. Maybe I need to push that wall aside to create a path.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the movable wall at 3 left,4 up.
2. Push it left or right to clear a path.
3. Navigate to the ""win"" rule.
4. Push the ""win"" rule left to be next to the key.
5. Use the adjacent ""is"" rule to create ""key is win"".

Alternatively, if I can't push the walls because of the ""stop"" rule, maybe I need to rearrange the text blocks around the ""stop"" to make it irrelevant.

Another angle: the ""door"" is at 6 left,4 up, and the ""win"" rule is next to it. So touching the door would win if the rule is ""door is win"". But the current rule is ""win is next to door"". To make ""door is win"", I need to create that rule. The ""door"" rule is at 1 right,3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 right,4 up. There's an ""is"" rule at 1 right,2 up. If I can move the ""door"" rule next to the ""win"" rule and the ""is"" rule, that could work.

But moving the ""door"" rule would require being adjacent to it. The ""door"" rule is at 1 right,3 up. If I can push it up or right, maybe align it with the ""win"" rule and ""is"" rule.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe the immediate action is to try moving the ""win"" rule left towards the key. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule. Let's assume I'm positioned to the left of the ""win"" rule. If I move left from there, I can push the ""win"" rule further left.

But without knowing my exact position, it's hard to say. The previous actions were ""up"", ""right"", ""left"", etc., but they failed. Maybe the issue is not the direction but the ability to push the objects.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to first move the ""is"" rule that's at 1 step right and 1 step up to be next to the key and the ""win"" rule. That way, forming ""key is win"" would be possible.

In any case, the key seems to be manipulating the text blocks to change the rules. The most promising path is likely creating ""key is win"" or ""door is you"". Since the door is next to the ""win"" rule, maybe making the door a win condition is easier.

To make ""door is win"", I need the ""door"" text block next to an ""is"" and the ""win"" text block next to another ""is"". The ""door"" rule is at 1 right,3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 right,4 up. There's an ""is"" rule at 1 right,2 up. If I can move the ""door"" rule up to be next to the ""win"" rule and the ""is"" rule, that could form ""door is win"".

So steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule at 1 right,2 up down to be next to the ""door"" rule.
2. Then, move the ""door"" rule up to be next to the ""win"" rule and the ""is"" rule.

This would create ""door is win"", making touching the door a win.

To move the ""is"" rule down, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""is"" rule is at 1 right,2 up. Moving down from there would place it at 1 right,1 up, which is next to the ""ball"" rule. Maybe that's possible.

Alternatively, push the ""is"" rule down past the ""ball"" rule. But the ""ball"" rule is at 1 left,1 up. Wait, the ""ball"" rule is at 1 left,1 up relative to where? This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Given the complexity and previous failures, perhaps the immediate action should be to try moving the ""win"" rule left towards the key. So the action would be ""left"" to push the ""win"" rule left.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba and any objects that are linked to me through other rules. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the map, there's a key located 6 steps to the left and 4 steps up. There's also a door at 5 steps left and 4 up. The walls are clustered to the left, and there are some rules scattered around. The ""win"" object is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. But right now, the path to the win might be blocked by walls or doors.

Wait, the ""door"" object is at 5 left and 4 up. If I can move that door, maybe I can open it. But doors are usually stoppers unless there's a rule allowing them to be moved. Let me check the active rules. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so unless I change that, I can't move the door. 

Hmm, the key is maybe farther away. To get to the key, I need to move left or up? The key is 6 steps left and 4 up from my current position. But the path might be blocked by walls. The walls are at 2 steps left and 4 up, and others at lower positions. Maybe I can move left past the wall? But walls are defined as ""stop,"" so I can't push them unless there's a rule that says otherwise. Since the only rule is ""baba is you,"" I can't move the walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by grabbing a text block. There are several ""is"" rules scattered around. For example, there's a rule `is` at 2 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to another text block, I could create a new rule. Like, if I combine ""baba"" with ""win"" using an ""is"" rule, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition. That way, I could just reach any spot and win. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 7 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text block next to a ""win"" text block and an ""is"" rule, I could make ""baba is win."" Let me see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one at 6 steps left and 2 steps down, and another at 7 steps left and 2 steps down. 

If I move down to the area where the `baba` rule is, maybe I can combine it with the ""win"" and ""is"" rules. But how do I move the text blocks? Since I'm Baba and the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that isn't stopped. The ""is"" rules aren't stopped, so I can pick them up and place them elsewhere. 

The plan would be: move down to the lower part where the `baba` rule is located (7 left, 2 down), then grab the ""is"" rule there (7 left, 3 down) and a ""win"" rule (2 right from current position?), and place them next to the `baba` rule to form ""baba is win."" Once that's done, the active rule would change, and I could win by touching any object, including the door or walls. 

So the steps would be: move down to reach the `baba` rule area, pick up the ""is"" rule, move it next to `baba`, then find the ""win"" rule and place it adjacent to form the new rule. Alternatively, maybe there's a ""win"" rule nearby. Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule at 2 steps right and 4 up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the ""win"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. But to get there, I might have to navigate past walls. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to move the ""is"" rule that's already nearby. The ""is"" rule at 6 left and 2 steps down. If I can move that down to where the `baba` rule is, then combine it with the `baba` and a ""win"" rule. 

But how do I move the text blocks step by step? Each action is a single step in one direction. So first, I need to move towards the `baba` rule. Let's see, the current position of Baba is implied by the objects' positions relative to him. The `baba` rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I'm positioned such that moving left 7 steps gets me there, but that might take multiple left moves. Alternatively, maybe the key and door positions indicate where I am. 

This is a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the relative positions, I need to figure out the best path. Let me try to outline the possible moves:

1. Move down to reach the lower area where the `baba` rule and other rules are located. There's a rule `is` at 7 left and 3 down, and `you` at 6 left and 2 down. 

2. Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to the `baba` rule. Then find the ""win"" rule and place it adjacent to form ""baba is win.""

3. After creating this new rule, I can touch any object (including the door or walls) to win.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the ""win"" rule easily, maybe I can use the existing ""win"" rule that's 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. But getting there requires moving right and up, but there's a wall at 2 left and 4 up. Wait, the walls are at 2 left and 4 up, so if I'm at 6 left and 4 up (the key's position), moving right would hit the wall. Hmm.

So perhaps the best approach is to create a new win rule by manipulating the text blocks in the lower area. To do that, I need to move down towards the `baba` rule. Let's check the current position of the key and door. The key is at 6 left and 4 up, door at 5 left and 4 up. The ""win"" rule is 3 right and 4 up, which is towards the right side, but there's a wall at 2 left and 4 up. So moving right from the key's position would be towards the wall. 

Therefore, focusing on creating a new rule seems safer. Let's try to move down. The last observation had me moving left, and now the key is at 6 left and 4 up, which might mean I moved left previously. The current position of Baba is such that the `baba` rule is at 7 left and 2 down, so I need to move down to get there. 

So the next action would be to move down to reach that area. Once there, I can pick up the ""is"" rule and place it next to `baba` and `win`.

Let's try to figure out the solution here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate the environment by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the object defined as ""win,"" but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, the key is located 6 steps to the left and 5 steps up. The door is 5 steps left and 5 up. There's a wall at 2 steps left and 5 up. There are ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. The ""win"" object is 3 steps to the right and 5 steps up. But there's also a ""rule `win`"" block at 7 steps left and 4 steps up. Wait, does that mean the win condition is overridden by another rule? Let me check the active rules again.

Currently, the only active rule is ""baba is you."" So other rules like ""win"" might be inactive unless moved. The ""rule `win`"" block is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, but maybe it's not forming an active rule because it's not connected properly. Hmm.

The key is important because maybe I need to pick it up to unlock the door. The door is at 5 left and 5 up, which is right above the key. If I can get to the key and pick it up, maybe I can use it on the door. But how do I move the key? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. Are any objects ""stop""? There's a ""rule `stop`"" at 6 left and 2 up, but that's a rule block, not an object. The walls are there, but they might be stoppable if there's a ""stop"" rule active. However, the current active rule is just ""baba is you,"" so walls might not be stop unless another rule says so. Wait, looking at the objects, there are walls, but the active rules don't have any ""stop"" properties except the ""rule `stop`"" block itself, which isn't active. So maybe I can push walls?

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, objects like walls are typically ""stop"" unless their property is changed. The current active rules don't have ""wall is stop"" because the ""rule `wall`"" block is at 9 left and 2 up, but that's not part of an active rule. Active rules are only the ones formed by the text blocks that are connected properly. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's a ""rule `stop`"" block, but it's not connected to any subject, so it's not an active rule. Therefore, walls might not be stoppable right now. That means I can push walls or move over them?

But in the game, usually, if there's a ""stop"" rule, walls are impassable. Since the current active rule is only ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""wall is stop"" active, perhaps the walls can be walked through or pushed. But I need to confirm. The user mentioned that objects defined as ""STOP"" or similar are immovable. So if there's a rule like ""wall is stop,"" then walls are stop. But in the current observation, the active rules are just ""baba is you."" The other rules like ""rule `wall`"" are present but not forming an active rule because they need to be connected to a subject and property. So walls might not be stoppable here.

So, the plan is: reach the key, then use it on the door to unlock it, and then go through the door to reach the win condition. But where is the win object? The ""win"" block is at 3 steps right and 5 steps up, but maybe there's another ""win"" rule. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule `win`"" at 1 step right and 3 steps up, but again, unless it's part of an active rule, it doesn't matter. The active rules only have ""baba is you,"" so the win condition is probably the ""win"" object located at 3 steps right and 5 steps up. However, the door is blocking that path. So I need to get past the door.

To open the door, I might need the key. The key is at 6 left and 5 up. If I can pick up the key (since I'm Baba and ""you""), then move it to the door and use it. But how do I move the key? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not stopped. Assuming walls aren't stopped, I can push them out of the way. But the key is on a separate part of the map. Let me look at the current position of Baba. The user hasn't provided Baba's position, but based on the objects, perhaps Baba is at the position defined by the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is at 8 left and 3 steps down. Wait, in the last observation before the current one, the ""rule `baba`"" block was at 9 left and 3 steps down. Now it's at 7 left and 1 step down. So maybe Baba moved there by previous actions.

Assuming Baba's current position is near the ""rule `baba`"" block at 7 left and 1 step down. The key is at 6 left and 5 up. So to get to the key, I need to move left and up. But there are walls in the way. Let's see the path. From 7 left and 1 down, moving left would be towards 6 left. But the wall at 2 step left and 5 step up is in the way. Wait, the walls are spread out. Let me visualize the map.

Alternatively, maybe the key is above the door, and I need to get it first. The door is at 5 left and 5 up. The key is at 6 left and 5 up. So the key is to the left of the door. If I can get the key, then move it to the door's position and use it. But how to move the key. Since I'm Baba, I can push objects that aren't stopped. So I need to move towards the key, which is 6 left and 5 up. But how to navigate the map.

Looking at the current observation, after moving down previously, the position of the key has changed. Previously, the key was at 7 left and 4 up, now it's at 6 left and 5 up. So maybe by moving down, I moved closer. The door is at 5 left and 5 up. So from the key's position (6 left,5 up), moving left once reaches the door. But the door is likely locked, requiring the key.

So the sequence would be: move to the key, pick it up, move to the door, use the key, then go through the door to the win condition.

But how to move there. Let's see the possible moves. From the current position (assuming it's near the ""rule `baba`"" block at 7 left and 1 step down), to get to the key at 6 left and 5 up, the path would involve moving left and up. However, there are walls at certain positions. For example, at 2 step left and 5 step up is a wall. But if walls are not stoppable (since no ""stop"" rule), then I can walk through them. Alternatively, maybe the walls are in the way and need to be pushed.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is adjacent and can be picked up with a single move. Let me check the distances. The key is 6 left and 5 up from the current position (assuming current position is 7 left and 1 down). So moving left once gets to 6 left, same y. Then moving up four steps to reach 5 up. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 2 step left and 5 up is a wall. Wait, that's not on the same path. Maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different location. Let me recheck the current objects:

- key 6 step to the left and 5 step up
- door 5 step to the left and 5 step up
- wall 2 step to the left and 5 step up
- rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 5 step up
- rule `win` 3 steps to the right and 5 step up
- rule `wall` 7 step to the left and 4 step up
- etc.

So the key is at 6 left,5 up. The wall is at 2 left,5 up. So the path from 7 left,1 down to 6 left,5 up would involve moving left twice (from 7 to 6) and up four times. But there's a wall at 2 left,5 up, which is not on the same path. So maybe the path is clear. However, there's a wall at 2 left and 4 up (rule `wall` at 7 left and 4 up?), wait no. The rule `wall` is at 7 left and 3 step up. The wall objects are at 4 left,3 up; 3 left,2 up; etc. Maybe the path is blocked by other walls.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move the ""rule `is`"" blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can create a ""key is win"" rule, then touching the key would make me win. Or maybe make ""baba is win"" so that I am the win condition.

But the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move text blocks. Let's look for ""is"" blocks that can be connected to create new rules. There are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around. For example, at 3 step up, 1 step right; at 2 step up, 1 step right; etc. If I can move an ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win,"" then create ""key is win,"" which would make touching the key make me win. Or perhaps ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition.

Looking at the current objects, the ""win"" object is at 3 steps right and 5 steps up. There's a ""rule `win`"" block at 7 left and 4 up, but that's not active. If I can move an ""is"" block next to ""win"" and another object, like ""baba,"" then create ""baba is win.""

But how to do that. Let's see the positions. The ""rule `is`"" block at 7 left and 1 step down is near the ""rule `baba`"" block. If I can move that ""is"" block up to connect with ""baba"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" block at 2 steps right and 5 step up is near the ""win"" object. If I move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" with ""win,"" creating ""baba is win.""

So the plan would be: move the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 5 step up (which is currently at 1 step right and 3 step up?) Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" blocks are at various positions. Let me parse the objects again:

- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 5 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` 6 step to the left and 3 steps down
- etc.

Assuming the current position of Baba is at 7 left and 1 step down (from the ""rule `baba`"" block at 7 left and 1 step down), then the nearby ""rule `is`"" block is at 5 step to the left and 1 step up. That would be at position 7 left -5 = 2 left, and 1 down +1 up = 0. So the ""is"" block is at 2 left, 0. But Baba is at 7 left,1 down. So moving left to 6 left, then up to reach the ""is"" block.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" block at 1 step right and 3 step up is at position 7 left +1 =8 left, 1 down +3 up=2 up. So that's 8 left,2 up. To reach that, from 7 left,1 down, move right once and up twice.

Once I have an ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win,"" making myself the win condition. Then I just need to touch the win object, which is at 3 steps right and5 up.

But how to maneuver the ""is"" block. Let's think step by step.

1. Move towards the ""is"" block at 8 left,2 up (1 step right and 3 step up from Baba's position).
2. Push that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win.""
3. Create the rule ""baba is win.""
4. Then, since I'm Baba and the win condition, touching the ""win"" object would complete the level.

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba, I can move objects that aren't stopped. The ""is"" block is a text block, so it's movable unless there's a ""stop"" rule. Since currently, there's no ""stop"" rule active, I can move the ""is"" block.

So, from Baba's position at 7 left,1 down, moving right once gets to 8 left,1 down. Then up three steps to reach 8 left,4 up. Then move left to 7 left,4 up, and then up to 7 left,5 up. Now, place the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win.""

The ""baba"" rule is at 7 left,1 step down (so position 7 left, -1 up?), and the ""win"" object is at 3 steps right and5 up from Baba's original position. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is more straightforward. If I can get the key and use it on the door, then go through. To get the key, navigate to its position, pick it up, move to the door, use the key, then enter the door.

But how to move the key. Since I'm Baba, I can move the key if it's not stopped. The key is at 6 left,5 up. From my current position (assuming 7 left,1 down), moving left once to 6 left,1 down, then up four times to 6 left,5 up. But along the way, are there walls blocking?

The wall at 2 left,5 up is far to the right, so not on the path. Other walls are at lower positions. So maybe the path is clear. Once I reach the key, I can pick it up (since it's a movable object), then move left to the door at5 left,5 up, use the key, and enter.

But in the game, you need to be adjacent to the door and have the key to unlock it. So after picking up the key, moving to the door and possibly pushing it or using the key on it.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the door passable. For example, ""door is you"" or ""door is win,"" but that might not help. Alternatively, make ""key is push"" so I can push the door with the key.

But maybe the simpler solution is to create a ""baba is win"" rule. Let's focus on that.

To create ""baba is win,"" I need to have the text blocks ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" connected in that order. The ""win"" object is at 3 steps right and5 up from my current position. The ""baba"" rule is at 7 left,1 step down. The ""is"" block is at8 left,2 up (1 step right and3 up from Baba).

So the plan is:

1. Move from 7 left,1 down to8 left,2 up (the ""is"" block).
2. Push the ""is"" block down to align with ""baba"" and ""win.""

But how to position it. If I move the ""is"" block to the left next to ""baba,"" then create ""baba is win.""

From the current position (7 left,1 down), moving right once to8 left,1 down. Then up two steps to8 left,3 up. Then left to7 left,3 up. Now, place the ""is"" block here between ""baba"" (which is at7 left,1 down) and ""win"" (which is at3 steps right and5 up). Wait, the ""win"" object is in a different area.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win"" text blocks. But ""win"" is an object, not a text block. To create a rule, you need a text block ""win"" which is the case here—the ""win"" object is present. So the rule would be ""[Subject] IS [Property]"", where Subject is ""baba"" and Property is ""win.""

So the ""baba"" text block is at9 left and3 steps down (from the ""rule `baba`"" block at9 left,3 steps down?), and the ""win"" object is at3 steps right and5 up from somewhere. This is getting too confusing without knowing the exact grid layout.

Perhaps the best approach is to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to form the rule ""baba is win."" Assuming the ""win"" object is reachable, then touching it would make me win.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, I'll choose to move the ""is"" block to create the desired rule. The action would be to move right to get to the ""is"" block, then move it left and up to connect with ""baba"" and ""win.""

Let's see. The user has been trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle, and after several attempts, the current observation shows that Baba is now positioned to the right of some key and door objects. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever Baba touches or moves can be manipulated.

First, I need to figure out the goal here. Typically, the goal is to reach a ""win"" object, but sometimes you can change what ""win"" means. Looking at the objects, there's a door and a key. The door is likely a ""stop"" because it's blocking the path, but maybe there's a way to change that. The key might be needed to unlock the door, but since I'm not sure if the key is required yet, let's check the rules again.

The active rules are ""baba is you,"" so Baba can move and push objects. The ""win"" rule is currently pointing to somewhere, but I need to see where exactly. In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 5 steps up. However, the key is 7 steps to the left and 5 steps up, door is 6 steps left, etc. Wait, maybe the ""win"" position has changed based on previous moves. But the user's previous actions might have moved the ""win"" rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 5 step up."" So if I can get to that position, maybe pushing it or interacting with it. But since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different place. Alternatively, the door might be a ""stop,"" so to get past it, I need to change its property. For example, if I can make the door into ""win,"" then standing on it would make me win.

Another approach: the key is present. If I can pick up the key and move it somewhere, but since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the key to a different location. However, the key is currently 7 steps to the left and 5 steps up. If I move right towards it, maybe I can grab the key. But the user's previous actions have had some failures, so maybe the path is blocked by walls or stops.

Looking at the map layout, there are several walls (step 4, 3, 2, etc., to the left). The ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 4 steps up, which would prevent movement through that area. So the path upward might be blocked. Perhaps moving down towards the door and key is better.

Wait, in the latest observation, after several moves down and left, Baba's position is now such that the ""rule `baba`"" is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe the user needs to move towards that to redefine rules. Alternatively, the ""is"" rules are scattered, and perhaps combining them to form new rules.

The key insight here is that to solve the puzzle, the user might need to change the ""door"" to ""win"" by moving the ""is"" rule next to it. For example, if there's a ""door is win"" rule, then touching the door would make the player win. Alternatively, making ""baba"" a ""win"" by placing ""baba is win"" next to a rule.

Looking at the current objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, and ""rule `you`"" at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If the user can move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""baba,"" then ""baba you"" would make the player control Baba. But since ""baba is you"" is already active, maybe that's already set.

Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 5 steps up. If the user can move towards that and interact with it, perhaps pushing the ""win"" rule to a different location where it's accessible. For example, moving the ""win"" rule next to the door so that standing on the door makes the player win.

But given the user's previous actions of moving up, right, left, down, etc., maybe the current position is near the ""win"" rule. The latest observation shows that after moving right and down, the key and door are closer. The user might need to move towards the ""win"" rule and rearrange the text blocks to create a new rule like ""door is win.""

Alternatively, since the user is Baba and ""baba is you,"" perhaps they can push the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" to create ""door is win."" To do that, the user would need to move the ""is"" rule (which is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down) towards the door (5 steps left and 5 steps up). But the directions might be tricky.

Another angle: the key is present. If the user can pick up the key and use it to unlock something, but in Baba Is You, keys are usually used to push other objects or activate rules. However, without a lock, maybe the key isn't necessary here.

Considering the latest observation, Baba's position is such that there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, and the ""you"" rule is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If the user moves down to that area, they might be able to redefine the rules. For example, moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win,"" making Baba himself the win condition.

But how to get there? The current action options are limited to up, down, left, right, or idle. The user needs to navigate towards the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. In the last observation, the ""win"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 5 steps up from Baba's position. So moving right twice and up five times might get to the ""win"" rule. However, there are walls and stops in the way, which can't be moved through unless they're not ""stop"" properties.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 4 steps up. So if the user is moving up, they might hit that stop wall. Therefore, moving right towards the ""win"" rule might be a better approach, avoiding the stop.

Alternatively, moving down to the area where the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules are located. If the user can get to that lower part, they might be able to rearrange the ""is"" rule to create a new rule like ""baba is win.""

But the user's previous actions have had failures, possibly because they tried to move into walls or stops. So the correct path would be to move towards the ""is"" rule that's 8 steps left and 3 steps down, which is in the lower part of the map. To get there from the current position, the user would need to move left and down.

Looking at the current position of Baba, based on the latest observation, the exact location isn't specified, but the ""rule `baba`"" is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. So if the user moves left and down, they can reach that area. Once there, they can push the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the desired rule.

However, the user needs to ensure they can move freely. The walls are at certain positions, so the path must be clear. If moving left and down is possible without hitting a ""stop"" wall, then that's the way to go.

Another possibility: the door is currently a ""stop,"" but if the user can change it to ""win,"" then standing on the door would win the game. To do that, they need to create a ""door is win"" rule. The existing ""is"" rules are scattered, so the user would need to move an ""is"" rule next to the door and the ""win"" rule.

The door is at 5 steps left and 5 steps up. The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 5 steps up. So if the user can move the ""is"" rule between the door and the ""win"" rule, forming ""door is win,"" that would work. To do that, the user would need to navigate to the door's location and rearrange the rules.

But considering the user's previous movements, they might be closer to the door now. The latest observation shows the door at 5 steps left and 5 steps up, and the ""win"" rule at 2 steps right and 5 steps up. So if the user moves right from the door's position, they can place the ""is"" rule there to create ""door is win.""

In the current observation, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, which is quite far from the door. The user would need to move that ""is"" rule to near the door and the ""win"" rule. However, moving an ""is"" rule requires that it's not blocked by ""stop"" properties.

Alternatively, the user can use existing ""is"" rules already on the map. For example, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If the user can move that ""is"" rule next to the door and the ""win"" rule, they can create the necessary rule.

But the challenge is navigating around the walls and stops. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 4 steps up, which might block the path upwards. So the user might need to go around it by moving right or left.

In summary, the best course of action is to move towards the door and the ""win"" rule, rearrange the ""is"" rule to create ""door is win,"" thereby making the door the win condition. To do this, the user should move right towards the door, then push the ""is"" rule next to the door and the ""win"" rule. The specific action would be to move right or down depending on the current position.

But based on the latest observation, the user's last action was ""right,"" moving Baba right, and now the key and door positions have shifted slightly. The current active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so movement is possible unless blocked by ""stop.""

Given the need to create a new rule, the user should move towards the area where the ""is"" rule is located (8 steps left and 3 steps down) to combine it with ""baba"" and ""win."" However, navigating there might require several left and down movements.

Alternatively, since the ""win"" rule is already at 2 steps right and 5 steps up, maybe the user can move towards that and place the ""is"" rule next to it and the door. But the exact positioning is crucial.

Considering the user's previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to reach the area with the ""baba"" and ""you"" rules, then move the ""is"" rule to create the desired rule. However, the available actions are only up, down, left, right, or idle.

Given the latest observation, the user's current position is such that moving down might lead them closer to the ""is"" rule at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. So the chosen action should be ""down"" to approach that area and rearrange the rules.

Let's see. The active rule is still ""baba is you"". I need to figure out how to get to the door or the win condition. Looking at the objects, the key is 7 steps left and 6 up, which might be blocking the path. The door is 6 steps left and 6 up. But there's a wall at 3 steps left and 6 up. The ""win"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 6 up from the key's position. But how do I reach it?

Wait, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can move around. But there are walls and stop rules. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 steps left and 2 up. Maybe I can push objects? No, because the rules don't say I can push. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered. If I can move an ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would make me win. Let me check the positions.

The ""win"" rule is at 2 steps right and 6 up from the key. But there's a wall there. Maybe I need to create a new rule. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. For example, there's an ""is"" at 1 step right and 6 up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"", that would work. But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a ""stop"" or ""wall"".

Looking at the current position of Baba: the rule ""baba"" is 8 steps left and 3 steps down from the wall. Wait, the observation lists ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down"" earlier, but now in the current observation, it's ""rule `baba` 8 step to the left"". So maybe I moved left previously. Let me visualize the map.

Baba's position is at 8 steps left (from where? Maybe the reference point is the player's starting position). The ""win"" rule is 2 steps to the right and 6 up from the key. The key is at 7 left, 6 up. So the win is at 7-2=5 left, 6+6=12 up? Not sure. Maybe coordinates are relative. Alternatively, the positions are given in steps from the current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""win"" rule is located at a position that's reachable by moving up or right from Baba's current location. Let me check the active rules. The main rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" or ""wall"" blocking.

The ""stop"" rules are at 6 left, 2 up and others. So if I try to go right, I might hit a wall at 3 left, 6 up. But maybe there's a path using the ""is"" rules. To create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""is"" next to both ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""is"" at 1 step right and 6 up could be moved. If I can get to that ""is"" block and move it adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win"", then the new rule would make me win.

So the plan is: move towards the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 6 up. But how? Let's see the current position of Baba. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 8 step to the left. So if I move right, I can approach that ""is"" block. But need to check if the path is clear. Between Baba and the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 6 up, are there any walls or stops?

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 3 step left and 6 up. If Baba is at 8 step left, moving right would take him towards 7, 6, etc. But the wall is at 3 left, which is to the left of Baba's current position. So moving right from 8 left would be towards lower left steps, which might be possible. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. If the ""rule `baba`"" is 8 step to the left, then moving right would decrease that number. For example, moving right once would make it 7 step left.

The ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 6 up from the key, which is at 7 left, 6 up. So the ""is"" is at 7-1=6 left, 6+6=12 up? Not sure. Maybe the coordinates are in a grid where each step moves in a direction. Alternatively, the positions are described relative to the player's position. So ""1 step right and 6 up"" means from the player's current position, move right 1, up 6.

In any case, the key is to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 6 up to create the new rule. So the actions needed are: move right to get near that ""is"" block, then move up to position it next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

But in the current observation, after previous moves, the ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 6 up. So if I'm at 8 step left, moving right once would get me to 7 step left. Then up 6 steps would reach the ""is"" block. But there might be walls in the way. For example, at 3 step left and 6 up, there's a wall. So if moving up from 7 step left, would that hit the wall at 3 left?

Wait, maybe the coordinates are such that moving up from 7 left would pass through the wall at 3 left. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the walls are in different positions. Let me recheck the current objects:

- wall 3 step to the left and 5 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 4 step up
- etc.

So the walls are at 3 left, varying up positions. The ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 6 up from the key. If the key is at 7 left, 6 up, then ""is"" is at 6 left, 12 up? Not sure. Maybe the coordinates are cumulative. Alternatively, the ""is"" is located at a position that's 1 step right and 6 up from the key's current position.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on actionable steps. The immediate goal is to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block from its current position to be adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"".

Looking at the current map:

- ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 6 up from the key (which is at 7 left, 6 up), so ""win"" is at 5 left, 12 up? Not sure. Alternatively, the ""win"" rule's position is 2 steps right and 6 up from wherever it's referenced. This is getting too ambiguous without a visual.

Alternative approach: Since ""baba is you"", I can move freely unless blocked. The ""stop"" rules are at specific positions. The ""is"" blocks are scattered. The key is near the top, and the win is also up there. Maybe I need to go up to reach the win, but there are walls. Alternatively, create a rule that makes the door a win or something.

Wait, there's a ""door"" object at 6 step left and 6 step up. If I can make ""door is win"", then standing on the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move an ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"". But how?

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by moving an ""is"" next to both. The ""is"" at 1 step right and 6 up is close to the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" to be adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win"", then the rule changes.

So steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 6 up.
2. Move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"".
3. Then move it next to ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".

To do this, I need to navigate to the ""is"" block. Current position of Baba is at the ""rule `baba`"" which is 8 step to the left. So if I move right, I can decrease the left steps. The ""is"" is at 1 step right and 6 up from the key, which is at 7 left, 6 up. So the ""is"" is at 7 -1 = 6 left, 6 +6 = 12 up? Not sure. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. So moving right once gets me to 7 left, then up six times to reach the ""is"" block.

But there's a wall at 3 left and 5 up. If I'm moving up from 7 left, I have to pass through steps 7,6,5,4,3 left, etc. The wall at 3 left and 5 up would block the path if moving upwards. So maybe I need to find another route.

Alternatively, move horizontally first. From 8 left, move right to 7 left, then 6, etc., until reaching the ""is"" block's position. But there are no walls mentioned in the left direction except at 3 left. So moving right from 8 to 7,6,5,4,3 left. At 3 left, there's a wall at 5 up. But if I'm moving down towards the ""is"" block's position, maybe that's clear.

Alternatively, the ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 6 up from the key. The key is at 7 left,6 up. So ""is"" is at 7-1=6 left,6+6=12 up. So from Baba's current position at 8 left, moving left to 6 left would require going left twice. But moving left from 8 to 7,6. Then up 6 steps to reach 12 up. But there's a wall at 3 left and 5 up. If I'm moving left from 8 to 6, that's okay, but then up. Maybe the path is blocked by the wall at 3 left,5 up. But 6 left is different from 3 left.

This is getting too confusing without a visual grid. Let's think of possible actions. The last move was ""down"", which brought me to this observation. Now, what's the best next move?

Looking at the active rules: ""baba is you"". The win condition is likely the door or a specific tile. The key is nearby, but maybe I need to use it on the door. However, there's no ""key is win"" rule. Alternatively, create ""door is you"" so that stepping on the door wins. To do that, move an ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""you"".

But ""you"" is a rule at 6 step left and 1 step down. So if I can move an ""is"" to connect ""door"" and ""you"", then ""door is you"" would make stepping on the door win.

Alternatively, make ""win is door"" so that the door is the win condition.

But how to get there. The ""is"" blocks are scattered. The one at 1 step right and 6 up is closest to the ""win"" rule. Maybe move that ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""door"".

Alternatively, focus on creating ""baba is win"". The ""is"" at 1 step right and 6 up is near the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" to be adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"".

Baba's current position is at the ""rule `baba`"" which is 8 step to the left. The ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 6 up. So relative to Baba, the ""is"" is to the right and up.

So from Baba's position (8 left), to reach the ""is"" at 1 right and 6 up, I need to move right once (to 7 left) and up six times. But there's a wall at 3 left and 5 up. If I'm moving up from 7 left, I pass through 7 left,5 up (no wall there), then 7 left,4 up (wall?), check the objects:

At 3 step left and 5 step up: wall. But if I'm at 7 left, moving up, the walls at 3 left are in a different column. So maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, the wall at 3 left and 5 up is in a different part of the map. So moving up from 7 left, steps would be 7 left,6 up (key's position), then 7 left,5 up (is there a wall? No, the wall is at 3 left,5 up). So moving up from 7 left is safe.

So the plan is: move right once to 7 left, then up six times to reach the ""is"" block at 1 right and 6 up. Once there, move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" (which is at 8 left) and ""win"" (2 right and 6 up from key).

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since ""baba is you"", I can move objects unless they are ""stop"". The ""is"" blocks are not stop, so I can move them.

So after reaching the ""is"" block, move it left to be adjacent to ""baba"" (which is at 8 left), making ""baba is [something]"". Then move it right to be adjacent to ""win"", making ""baba is win"".

But in the current observation, after moving down, the ""is"" block is still at 1 step right and 6 up. So the next action should be to move right to get closer to that ""is"" block.

Wait, in the previous step, the action was ""down"", which brought me to this observation where the ""key"" is now at 7 step left and 5 step up, etc. So the position of Baba must have changed. The ""rule `baba`"" is now at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down? Not sure.

Alternatively, each action changes the player's position. For example, moving up would decrease the up steps, or increase the left steps depending on the coordinate system.

This is quite challenging without a visual. But based on the previous actions and observations, the best bet is to move towards the ""is"" block to create the desired rule. So the next action should be ""right"" to get closer to the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 6 up.

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and push things. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""win"" rule located 1 step to the right and 6 steps up from my current position. But wait, the ""win"" object's position might be different. Let me check the objects again.

Hmm, there's a ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 6 up, but I'm not sure if that's the actual win object. Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I need to move towards the win condition. The win condition is typically an object labeled ""win,"" but in this case, the rule is ""win"" positioned at certain coordinates. Maybe I need to interpret that rule as the win condition.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 6 up. But I'm currently at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 9 steps to the left. Wait, maybe I need to move towards that ""win"" rule. But how?

Wait, the key is at 8 steps left and 6 up. The door is at 7 left and 6 up. The walls are 4 steps left and 6 up. The ""is"" rule is at 6 step up. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 6 up. So, if I move right, I can approach the ""win"" rule. But I need to check if there are any obstacles.

The walls are at 4 steps left and varying up positions. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule at 9 left), moving right towards the ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 6 up. Wait, but the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse them again.

The key is 8 left, 6 up. Door 7 left, 6 up. Wall 4 left, 6 up. Rule `is` is at 6 step up (maybe vertical position?), and `win` is 1 right, 6 up. So maybe the vertical steps are layers. So moving up would take me towards higher vertical layers.

But my current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 9 left and 3 steps down. Wait, no, the ""baba"" rule is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down in the initial observation. But in the latest observation, the ""baba"" rule is at 9 step to the left. So perhaps the coordinates are relative. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative to the player's position. If the player is at a certain point, the objects are positioned left/right and up/down from there. So to reach the ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 6 up, I need to move right and up multiple times.

But looking at the active rules, ""baba is you"" allows me to move. The key is nearby, but maybe I don't need it yet. The door is 5 steps to the left and 6 up, but if I can push it, maybe. However, doors are usually stoppers unless rules change them. But since the rule is still ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""door is push"" or something, I can't push the door.

The main goal is to reach the ""win"" rule. So the plan is to move towards the ""win"" rule located at 1 step right and 6 up. To do that, I need to move right multiple times and up multiple times. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's check the walls' positions.

Walls are at 4 left, 6 up; 4 left,5 up; 4 left,4 up; etc. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule at 9 left), moving right towards 8 left (key's position), then 7 left (door), then 6 left (win's horizontal position). But vertically, the ""win"" is at 6 up. So I need to move up 6 steps. However, the walls are at 4 left, which is to the right of my current position. So moving right from 9 left to 8 left (key), then 7 left (door), then 6 left (win's horizontal spot). But vertically, the ""win"" is at 6 up. So I need to move up 6 steps from where I am.

But how do the coordinates work? If I'm at 9 left, moving right would decrease the left steps. So moving right once brings me to 8 left, which is the key's position. Then right again to 7 left (door), then right to 6 left. Then up 6 steps to reach the ""win"" at 6 up. But along the way, are there walls blocking?

The walls at 4 left are further to the right, so from 9 left moving right to 6 left, there's no wall in between. The walls at 4 left are at different vertical levels. So the path should be clear. Therefore, the optimal action is to move right towards the ""win"" rule. Each move right gets me closer horizontally, and then up vertically. But since the ""win"" is 6 steps up, I need to combine right and up moves. However, the action choices are single steps. So the immediate action should be to move right to get closer to the horizontal position of the ""win"" rule.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other objects by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, but maybe I need to change that. Looking at the objects:

The key is 9 steps to the left and 6 up. The door is nearby. There's a rule `win` at 6 steps up, but I'm not sure where that is exactly. The walls and stop rules are probably blocking paths. 

I see a rule `win` at 6 step up, but maybe it's positioned in a way that I can't reach it yet. There's a `key` at 9 left, 6 up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock the door? But how do I move the key? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't stopped. The key is there, but are there any stop rules blocking its movement? The nearby rules are `is` and `win`, which shouldn't block movement.

Wait, the `stop` rule is at 8 step left and 5 up. So if I try to move something towards the door or key, I have to avoid that stop. Let me check the positions again. 

The current Baba (rule `baba` is at 10 left, 6 up, I think). So I need to move towards the key or the win condition. The `win` rule is at 6 step up, which might be in the same vertical line. If I can reach the `win` rule, maybe I can drag it somewhere or change it. 

But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. The walls are at 5 step left and 6 up, so moving right towards the key might be possible. Or maybe down to avoid walls? Let's see. If I go down from my current position (assuming I'm at 10 left, 6 up), moving down would take me to 10 left, 5 up. There's a `stop` rule at 8 left, 5 up, so I can't go past that. 

Looking at the objects, the `is` rule is at 1 step left and 6 up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. For example, if I move `is` next to `baba`, making ""baba is win,"" then Baba would become the win condition. That way, touching the win area would make me win. 

So the plan could be: move the `is` rule next to Baba. The `is` is at 1 left, 6 up. If I move right towards it, maybe position it adjacent to Baba's rule. But how to move the `is`? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move objects unless they're stopped. The `is` rule isn't stopped, so I can pick it up. 

Current position of `is` is 1 left, 6 up. My position is 10 left, 6 up. The distance between me and the `is` is 9 steps to the left. Wait, no—that can't be. If the `is` is 1 step left and 6 up, and Baba is at 10 left, then the `is` is actually to the right of Baba. Because left is negative direction. So moving right towards the `is` would make sense. 

So actions needed: move right to reach the `is` rule. Then place it next to Baba's rule to create ""baba is win."" That way, Baba becomes the win condition. Once that's done, just moving into the area designated as win would make the game end in victory. 

But how to execute that step by step. First, move right from current position (10 left) to reach the `is` at 1 left. Wait, the distance is 10 - 1 = 9 steps to the right. But each action is one step. So I need to move right multiple times. 

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving up, left, down, etc., possibly navigating towards the key or rules. But now, the key is far to the left, and the `is` is to the right. Maybe the optimal path is to move right towards the `is` rule. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to move the `win` rule into a position where touching it would work. But the `win` rule is at 6 step up, which might be in the same column as Baba. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then moving into the win area would work. 

So the key steps are: 
1. Move right to grab the `is` rule.
2. Place the `is` next to the `baba` rule to create ""baba is win.""
3. Then, move into the win area. 

But how to move the `is`? Each move action is one step. So from position 10 left, 6 up, moving right 9 steps to reach the `is` at 1 left, 6 up. But that's a lot of steps. However, in the previous observations, the user was moving left, up, etc., perhaps getting closer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a nearby `is` rule that's closer. Looking at the objects, there's an `is` at 1 left, 6 up, and another at 7 left, 3 steps down. But the closer one is the one at 1 left, 6 up. 

So the next action should be to move right towards that `is` rule. Each right move brings me closer. Let's see, in the last observation, the user moved right, and now the key is at 9 left, 6 up, which is further left. So perhaps the user is moving towards the `is` rule. 

But in the current observation, the `is` is at 1 step left and 6 step up. If I'm at 10 left, 6 up, moving right once would position me at 9 left, 6 up. Then continue right until reaching the `is`. 

So the chosen action should be ""right"" to move closer to the `is` rule. Once I grab it and place it next to `baba`, the rule changes, and I can win by moving into the win area.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but sometimes the rules change that. Looking at the current observation, the active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can manipulate text blocks to change the rules.

First, I need to see where the WIN object is. The observation shows a rule `win` at 6 steps up. But since I'm controlled by ""baba is you"", I can move any object that isn't STOP or another immovable property. However, some objects might have STOP properties. Let me check the objects around.

There's a key 9 steps to the left and 6 steps up, same as the door and wall. The rule `is` is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps up. Maybe I need to move that rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""win"" to be ""baba is win"", then touching the WIN object would make me win. But how do I do that?

Looking at the other rules, there's a rule `you` at 8 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Maybe I can combine ""baba"" with ""win"" using the `is` rule. The `is` rule is a text block that can be moved. If I can move the `is` next to ""baba"" and ""win"", then I can create ""baba is win"", making myself the win condition.

To do that, I need to navigate to where the `baba` rule is located. The `baba` rule is at 10 steps to the left. So from my current position (not sure where I am exactly, but the key and door are 9 steps left and 6 up), I might need to move left to reach the `baba` rule. Alternatively, if I can move the `is` rule to the `baba` and `win` positions.

Wait, the `is` rule is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps up. The `baba` rule is at 10 steps to the left. So there's a distance between them. Maybe I can move the `is` rule towards the `baba` by pushing it with other movable objects. But some walls are there, like the wall at 5 steps left and 6 steps up. Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can move the `win` rule next to `baba` using the `is` rule. Let's see: if I move the `is` rule to the right (since `is` is at 1 left, 6 up, moving right would bring it closer to the `baba` at 10 left). But moving right from the `is` position would require navigating past other objects. There's a wall at 5 left, 6 up. Maybe I can push the `is` rule to the right by moving right steps, but I need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should move the `you` rule. The `you` rule is at 8 left, 3 down. If I make ""baba is you"" and then ""you is win"", but I already have ""baba is you"". Maybe combining ""you"" with ""win"" would make ""you is win"", but I need to have the `is` rule in place.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me recap the steps:

1. The goal is to reach the WIN object, but currently, the rules don't make Baba win by touching it.
2. The active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move text blocks.
3. To make touching WIN make me win, I need to create a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""win is you"".
4. The `is` rule is available, so I can use that to link other objects.

Looking at the objects, the `win` rule is at 6 steps up. If I can move the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`, that would create the desired rule. The `baba` rule is at 10 steps left. So from the `is` position (1 left, 6 up), I need to move left multiple times to reach the `baba` rule. But there's a wall at 5 left, 6 up. How do I get past that?

Maybe I can move the wall out of the way. But the wall is defined as a STOP property, which means I can't move it. Unless there's a rule that changes that. Let me check the active rules. The only active rule is ""baba is you"". There's a rule `wall` at 10 left, 5 up, which might define that certain walls are STOP. But since I can move objects that aren't STOP, maybe I can move the `wall` rule to remove the STOP property from some walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the `key` to unlock something, but there's no LOCK object mentioned here. The key is present, but I'm not sure where the lock is.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and can push objects (except STOP), maybe I can push the `is` rule to the left towards the `baba` rule. Let's see the positions:

- `is` is at 1 step left, 6 up.
- `baba` is at 10 step left.

The distance is 9 steps to the left. But moving left from the `is` position would require pushing past other objects. Let's check the path:

From `is` (1 left, 6 up), moving left step by step:

- Step 1: To 0 left, 6 up. Is there an object there? Looking at the objects, at 5 step left and 6 up there's a wall. Wait, no, the wall at 5 left, 6 up is further to the right. The objects listed are:

key 9 left, 6 up

door 8 left, 6 up

wall 5 left, 6 up

rule `is` 1 left, 6 up

rule `win` 6 up

So between the `is` at 1 left and the wall at 5 left, there's open space? Wait, the keys, door, and walls are at different positions. The `is` rule is at 1 left, 6 up. To the right of that (increasing left steps) are the key, door, walls at 5, 8, 9 steps left. So moving left from `is` (1 left) would go to 0 left, then -1, etc., but there are no objects in between. So I can move left from the `is` rule towards the `baba` rule at 10 left.

But how do I carry the `is` rule? Since I'm Baba (you), I can push objects. So if I move left towards the `is` rule, I can push it leftwards. For example, if I move left from my current position (assuming I'm near the `is` rule), I can push the `is` rule to the left, creating the ""baba is win"" rule.

Wait, but where is Baba's position in this observation? The observation lists objects but doesn't specify Baba's location. That's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to plan the movement. Maybe I need to assume that I'm at the same position as the `baba` rule, which is at 10 steps left. Or perhaps I'm somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the key is near the `baba` rule. The key is at 9 steps left and 6 up, while `baba` is at 10 left. So if I move right from the key's position, I can reach the `baba` rule. But there's a wall at 5 left, 6 up, which is to the right of the `is` rule. Wait, the walls are scattered. Let's visualize the grid based on the observations.

Let's try to map out the positions:

Assuming all positions are relative to a starting point (maybe the upper left corner). Let's consider each object's coordinates as (horizontal step, vertical step), where left is negative and right is positive, up is positive and down is negative. But the observation uses ""step to the left"" and ""step up"", so perhaps each object's position is described relative to the player's current position.

Alternatively, the positions are absolute. For example, the key is 9 steps to the left and 6 steps up from the reference point (maybe the upper left corner of the level). But without knowing the player's position, it's challenging.

This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe I should look for the nearest movable object. The `is` rule is at 1 step left and 6 steps up. If I can move that `is` rule next to `baba` and `win`, that would create a new rule. So the plan is:

1. Move to the `is` rule's location (1 left, 6 up).
2. Push the `is` rule to the left towards the `baba` rule at 10 left.
3. Once the `is` is next to `baba`, create ""baba is win"" by placing `win` next to them.

But how to move the `is` rule? Since I'm Baba (you), I can push it. So if I'm positioned to the right of the `is` rule, I can move left to push it leftward.

Alternatively, if the `is` rule is to my left, I can move right to push it further left.

Wait, the direction matters. If the `is` rule is 1 step to my left, then to push it further left, I need to move right towards it, then push it left.

Assuming I'm at the same level as the `is` rule (same vertical position), which is 6 steps up. If I'm to the right of the `is` rule (i.e., my position is 0 left, 6 up), then moving left once would take me to the `is` rule's position. Then, pushing the `is` rule left would involve moving left again, but I need to see if there's space.

The `baba` rule is at 10 left, 6 up. So from the `is` at 1 left, moving left 9 steps would reach `baba`. But along the way, are there any walls or STOP objects that block the path?

The wall at 5 left, 6 up is between the `is` at 1 left and `baba` at 10 left. So moving left from `is` (1 left) to 5 left would hit the wall at 5 left, 6 up, which is a STOP. Since I can't move STOP objects, I can't push past them. This is a problem.

So maybe I need to move the wall out of the way first. But how? The wall's property is defined by the `wall` rule at 10 left, 5 up. If I can delete that rule or change it, maybe the wall becomes movable. But to do that, I need to move the `wall` rule text block.

The `wall` rule is at 10 left, 5 up. If I can move that rule to a different position, perhaps removing its association with the wall at 5 left, 6 up. For example, if I move the `wall` rule to 5 left, 6 up, then the wall at 5 left, 6 up would no longer be a STOP, making it movable. Then I could push it away.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the `wall` rule at 10 left, 5 up.
2. Push it to 5 left, 6 up (the position of the STOP wall).
3. Now, the wall at 5 left, 6 up is no longer a STOP, so I can push it out of the way.
4. Then, move the `is` rule from 1 left, 6 up to 10 left, 6 up beside `baba`.
5. Create the rule ""baba is win"" by placing `win` next to `baba`.
6. Finally, move to the WIN object (now that the rule is in place) and touch it to win.

This seems like a possible path. Let's break it down:

First, navigate to the `wall` rule at 10 left, 5 up. To do that, I need to move down from the current `win` rule at 6 up to 5 up. Then move left from wherever I am to reach 10 left. But again, without knowing my current position, it's hard. Alternatively, assuming I'm near the `baba` rule at 10 left, but that's where the `you` rule is also located.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on moving the `is` rule first. But the wall blocks the path. So perhaps the only way is to remove the STOP property from the wall at 5 left, 6 up.

To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule text block from its current position (10 left, 5 up) to the position of the wall it's defining (5 left, 6 up). Once the `wall` rule is moved there, that specific wall would no longer be a STOP.

So, moving the `wall` rule from 10 left, 5 up to 5 left, 6 up. How to do that?

Assuming I'm positioned to the right of the `wall` rule at 10 left, 5 up. I can move left to reach it, then push it down to 5 left, 6 up. Let's see:

- Current position of `wall` rule: 10 left, 5 up.
- Target position: 5 left, 6 up.

To move it there, I need to move left 5 steps and down 1 step. But can I push the `wall` rule in that direction? The `wall` rule is a text block, so if it's not STOP, I can move it. Wait, the `wall` rule itself is defined as a property, but the text block ""wall"" can be moved unless it's part of a STOP rule.

Looking at the active rules, the only rule is ""baba is you"". There's a `wall` rule at 10 left, 5 up, which might be defining that certain walls are STOP. But the actual wall objects (like the one at 5 left, 6 up) are separate. So the `wall` rule text block can be moved.

So, to move the `wall` rule from 10 left, 5 up to 5 left, 6 up:

1. Move to the `wall` rule's location (10 left, 5 up).
2. Push it down and left to the target position.

Assuming I can move left and down from there, this would relocate the `wall` rule, thereby changing which objects are considered walls. Once done, the wall at 5 left, 6 up is no longer STOP, so I can move it out of the way.

After that, I can move the `is` rule from 1 left, 6 up to 10 left, 6 up next to `baba`, creating ""baba is win"".

Finally, move to the `win` object at 6 up and touch it to win.

This seems like a viable plan. Now, the question is: what's the sequence of actions to achieve this?

First, I need to navigate to the `wall` rule at 10 left, 5 up. Assuming I'm near there, perhaps I can move left and down. But without knowing my exact position, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the `baba` rule is at 10 left, and I'm next to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to focus on moving the `is` rule past the wall by removing the STOP property first.

So the step-by-step actions would be:

1. Move down from the current position (assuming I'm at 6 up) to 5 up to reach the `wall` rule.
2. Move left to 10 left to get to the `wall` rule.
3. Push the `wall` rule down to 5 left, 6 up, eliminating the STOP property there.
4. Move to the `is` rule at 1 left, 6 up.
5. Push the `is` rule left past the now-movable wall at 5 left, 6 up to reach the `baba` rule at 10 left.
6. Create ""baba is win"" by placing `win` next to `baba`.
7. Move to the `win` object to win.

But translating this into actual actions (up, down, left, right) requires knowing the relative positions. Since each action changes the player's position by one step, I need to plan the direction accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to move the `is` rule next to `baba` and `win` without dealing with the wall. But the wall blocks the path.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to move right towards the `key` or `win` rule. Alternatively, since the `win` rule is at 6 up, and I'm currently at 6 up (as per the latest observation), maybe moving down towards it.

Wait, in the latest observation, the `win` rule is at 6 steps up. The player (Baba) is presumably at the `baba` rule's position, which is 10 steps left. So to reach the `win` rule at 6 up, which is in the same horizontal line (10 left), I need to move up or down?

If the `win` rule is at 6 up and the `baba` rule is at 10 left, 6 up (same vertical position?), then moving horizontally to the `win` rule's position. But the `win` rule is at 6 up, same as the `baba` rule. So if I'm at 10 left, 6 up (baba's position), moving right or left along the same vertical line to reach the `win` rule at 6 up.

But the `win` rule is at 1 step to the right and 6 step up from the `is` rule's position. Wait, the `win` rule is listed as ""rule `win` 6 step up"" in the active rules. That might mean it's 6 steps up from the reference point, but the objects have specific positions.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let me try to think differently.

The key objects are:

- Baba is you (active rule).
- Win is at a certain position.
- The `is` rule is available to create new rules.
- The walls are STOP, but if I can remove their STOP property by moving the `wall` rule.

The critical step is to create ""baba is win"" or ""win is you"". Since I'm already ""baba is you"", if I make ""win is you"", then touching win would make me win","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" condition, but since the rules can be changed, I need to see if there's another way.

Looking at the objects, there's a key and a door. But the door is labeled as a ""stop"" property, which probably means I can't pass through it unless I change its rule. The key might be useful to unlock something, but I'm not sure where it goes yet. 

There's also a ""win"" object somewhere. The previous observations show that the ""win"" rule is moving around, but right now, the active ""win"" is 6 steps up. I need to get to that. But there are walls and stop blocks in the way. 

Wait, since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can pick up text blocks. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. If I can move an ""is"" block next to another rule, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move an ""is"" to make ""key is win,"" then grabbing the key would make me win. That could be a way to bypass the door.

Looking at the current setup, there's a rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 step up. Maybe if I move that ""key"" rule next to a ""win"" rule, I can combine them. But I need to reach that ""key"" rule first. The problem is that the path is blocked by walls and stop blocks. 

Alternatively, maybe changing ""baba"" to be ""win."" If I can create a rule like ""baba is win,"" then since I'm Baba, I would be win, and touching the win object would do nothing, but standing on it might work. But how to do that? There's a ""rule `baba` 10 step to the left"" somewhere. If I can move that ""baba"" text block next to a ""win"" text block and add an ""is"" in between, that could work. 

Let me see the positions. The ""baba"" rule is 10 steps to the left, and the ""win"" rule is 3 steps up. There's an ""is"" rule at 7 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe moving that ""is"" up to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" But getting there might require navigating through the other objects. 

Another angle: the door is a stop, but if I can make the door not a stop. There's a ""rule `stop` 8 step to the left and 5 step up."" If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the door or change it to something else, maybe I can pass through. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the door's rule. 

Alternatively, using the key to unlock the door, but there's no rule saying a key unlocks a door here. Unless I can create that rule. If I can make ""key is unlock"" or ""door is unlock key,"" then picking up the key might open the door. But again, I need to move the necessary ""is"" blocks to form that rule. 

The main challenge is moving the ""is"" blocks without being blocked by walls or stop blocks. Since I'm Baba, I can move through walls, but stop blocks prevent movement. So I need to find a path that avoids stop blocks. 

Looking at the map layout, the ""baba"" rule is at the far left, and the ""win"" is up high. Maybe the solution is to make Baba into the win by combining the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules with an ""is."" So the plan is: move the ""baba"" rule next to a ""win"" rule and insert an ""is"" between them. 

To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""baba"" rule is located, which is 10 steps to the left. But the path there might be blocked. Alternatively, find an ""is"" block that's movable and bring it to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" blocks on the map. There's an ""is"" at 6 steps to the left and 3 steps up, another at 7 steps left and 2 steps down, etc. Maybe moving one of those towards the ""baba"" and ""win"" rules. 

But how to move the text blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and move in a direction that pushes them, provided they're not stopped. Looking at the objects, some rules are under ""stop"" properties. For example, the ""stop"" rule at 8 steps left and 5 steps up might be blocking movement towards the door. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, check if there's an immediate way to win. The ""win"" is currently 6 steps up. If I can move up there, but there's a wall at 5 steps left and 6 steps up. However, since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move through walls. Wait, no—Baba can move through walls only if he's not defined as ""stop"" or another immovable property. But the default is ""baba is you,"" so unless there's a rule like ""baba is stop,"" I can move through walls. 

So maybe I can just walk up to the ""win"" object regardless of walls. Let me check the positions. The ""win"" is at 6 steps up. My current position isn't specified, but the key and door are moving left and up each time I move. Maybe I need to adjust my position. 

Alternatively, since the key is moving left each time I move left or right, perhaps the key is part of a mechanism. Maybe I need to grab the key first. But to grab the key, I have to move to its location. However, the key's position is changing based on previous actions. 

This is tricky. Let's focus on creating a new rule. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then I would be the win condition. To do that, I need to place the ""baba"" text block next to a ""win"" text block with an ""is"" in between. 

Looking at the current objects, there's a ""rule `baba` 10 step to the left"" and a ""rule `win` 6 step up."" There's also a ""rule `is` 7 step to the left and 2 steps down."" Maybe I can move that ""is"" block up to connect ""baba"" and ""win."" 

To move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. The ""is"" block is at 7 left, 2 down. If I move down towards it, but there's a wall at 5 step left and 2 step up. Wait, the path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, find another ""is"" block. There's another ""is"" at 1 step right and 4 step up. Maybe use that. 

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""win"" rule closer to Baba by moving the ""is"" blocks. For example, if I can make ""you is win,"" but since ""you"" is part of the ""baba is you"" rule, changing that might help. 

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe changing ""you"" to ""win."" There's a ""rule `you` 8 step to the left and 3 steps down."" If I can move that ""you"" rule next to a ""win"" rule with an ""is,"" then ""you is win"" would make Baba win. 

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule and the ""win"" rule together with an ""is."" 

Given the complexity, perhaps the best action is to move towards the ""is"" blocks to manipulate them. For example, moving right to get to the ""is"" at 1 step right and 4 step up, then pushing it towards the ""win"" rule. 

But without knowing my exact position, it's hard to say. Alternatively, keep moving right to gather the ""is"" blocks needed to create the desired rule. 

Alternatively, since the key is moving left each time I move left, maybe the key is part of a loop, and I need to adjust my movement to stay near it. 

In the previous steps, moving left several times caused the key and other objects to shift left. Maybe the solution requires a specific sequence of movements to position the ""is"" blocks correctly. 

Considering all this, the safest bet might be to continue moving right to gather more ""is"" blocks and position them to create the necessary rules. So the next action should be ""right.""

Let's try to figure out what I need to do here. The game is Baba Is You, and the active rule is still ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to reach the win object, which is a door or something similar, but I remember that rules can be changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 9 steps to the left and 6 steps up. The door is 8 steps to the left and 6 steps up. There are walls everywhere, and some rules like ""wall is"" and ""stop is"". The ""win"" rule is positioned 6 steps up, which might be the door or another object. 

Baba is defined as ""you"", so I can move around. The problem is that the path to the door or win object might be blocked by walls or ""stop"" properties. The key is nearby, but I need to see if I can reach it. The key is at 9 steps left and 6 up. If I move right, maybe I can approach it. But wait, the walls are at 5 steps left and 6 up. So moving right from my current position would take me closer to the key. 

Wait, but how am I positioned now? The observation doesn't tell me where I am, only the positions of the objects. Oh right, in Baba Is You, the player's position is inferred relative to the objects. But since the active rules are still ""baba is you"", I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" rule. 

Looking at the rules: there's a ""stop"" rule at 8 steps left and 5 up. That might be a wall or another object that stops movement. Also, the ""wall"" rules are defining which objects are walls. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can push or move objects that aren't stopped. 

The key is to the left and up. If I move right towards it, maybe I can pick up the key. But the key's position is 9 steps left and 6 up. If I'm currently at a position relative to those coordinates, moving right would decrease the left steps. For example, if I'm 10 steps left, moving right once would make it 9 steps left. 

Alternatively, maybe the win condition is at 6 steps up, which could be the door. But the door is at 8 steps left and 6 up. There's a wall at 5 steps left and 6 up, so I might need to go around. But how? If I can move the wall or change a rule, that could help. 

Wait, there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. For example, a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 6 step up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to create a new rule. Like, if I move the ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""key"", I could make ""key is win"" or something. But I need to check the positions. 

The ""win"" rule is at 6 step up, but its position isn't specified in the observation. Wait, looking back, the ""win"" rule is listed as ""rule `win` 6 step up"". That means it's vertically aligned 6 steps up, but how far left or right? Maybe it's directly above something. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. The key is at 9 left, 6 up. The door is at 8 left, 6 up. The walls are at 5 left, 6 up. So between me and the key/door, there's a wall at 5 left, 6 up. To get past that, I might need to move the wall or change its property. 

Since I'm Baba and can move objects unless they're stopped, maybe I can push the wall if it's not stopped. But the ""stop"" rule is at 8 left, 5 up. That's to the right and below the wall. So the wall at 5 left, 6 up isn't stopped, so I can push it. 

If I can move the wall, maybe I can create a path. But how? To push the wall, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I want it to go. For example, if the wall is at 5 left, 6 up, and I'm to the right of it, I could move left to push it right. 

But where am I located? The observation doesn't say, but maybe the key is to my left and up. If I move right towards the key, I might be able to reach it. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" text next to them, then grabbing the key would make me win. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 6 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""key"" and ""win"" rules, I could form ""key is win"". That way, picking up the key would make me win. 

So steps to do that: move right towards the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 6 up. Then, move that ""is"" next to the key and win. Once ""key is win"" is created, grabbing the key would make me win. 

But how to move the ""is"" rule? Since it's a text block, I can move it if it's not stopped. There's a ""stop"" rule at 8 left, 5 up, which is not blocking the ""is"" at 1 left, 6 up. So I can move the ""is"" rule rightwards towards the key and win. 

Alternatively, maybe the current ""win"" rule is at 6 step up but not specified left/right. If I can place ""key is win"" then key becomes win. 

So the plan is: move right to reach the ""is"" rule, then move it to connect with key and win. Then grab the key to win. 

But how to execute this step by step. Current actions possible: up, down, left, right, idle. 

Given that, the immediate action would be to move right to reach the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at 1 step to the left and 6 step up. So from my current position, moving right once would bring me to 1 left, then maybe continue right to get to the key. 

Alternatively, if the ""is"" is above the key, maybe I need to move up first. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the simplest action is to move right towards the key, as it's nearby and crucial for potentially making key the win condition. 

So the chosen action is right.

The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key positioned at 9 steps left and 6 steps up. The door is right next to the key at 8 left, 6 up. Then there's a wall at 5 left, 6 up. There's a rule `is` at 1 left, 6 up, and `win` is 6 steps up, which I think is directly above the current position of the door? Hmm, not sure. 

Wait, the `win` rule is at 6 step up. The door is at 8 left, 6 up. So the `win` is probably on the same horizontal line as the door. But how do I reach it? The door might be a `stop` object if there's a `stop` rule associated with it. Let me check the rules. There's a `rule 'stop' 8 step to the left and 5 step up`. That's not directly on the door. The door is at 8 left, 6 up. So maybe the door isn't stopped? Or maybe the `stop` rule is somewhere else.

Also, there's a `rule 'baba' 10 step to the left`, which is probably a separate text block. And `rule 'is' 9 step to the left` and `rule 'you' 8 step to the left`, which are near the edge. 

The player (Baba) is at 10 step to the left and some down position? Wait, the current observation lists the key, door, walls, and rules with their positions relative to where? Maybe the player's position is implied by the objects around. But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not defined as stop. 

Looking at the rules, `rule 'stop'` is at 8 left, 5 up. So any object at 8 left,5 up is stop. But the door is at 8 left,6 up. Not sure if that's affected. 

The key is at 9 left,6 up. If I can move the key, maybe I can use it on the door. But the door is at 8 left,6 up. So moving right from the key's position would get to the door. But how do I get there? The player's current position isn't explicitly stated, but the rules and objects are positioned relative to... maybe the player's position? For example, the `rule 'baba' 10 step to the left` would be 10 steps left from the player's position. So the player is to the right of that. 

So if Baba is the player, and `rule 'baba'` is at 10 left, then the player is at 10 left minus some steps. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. Let me try to visualize:

Assuming the player is at position (0,0). Then:

- The `rule 'baba'` is at 10 step to the left, which would be (-10, 0).
- The `you` rule is at 8 step to the left, so (-8,0).
- The `win` rule is at 6 step up, which is (0,6).
- The key is at 9 left and 6 up: (-9,6).
- The door is at (-8,6).
- The `stop` rule is at (-8,5).

So the player is likely at (-10,0), based on the `rule 'baba'` being 10 steps left. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so the player can move any object that's not stop. 

The goal is probably to reach the `win` at (0,6). But the path is blocked by walls and the door. The door is at (-8,6), which is one step to the right of the key (-9,6). To get to the door, the player needs to move right from their position (-10,0) to (-9,6), which is diagonally up and right. However, there are walls at (-5,6), (-5,5), etc., which might block the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can manipulate the rules to change the door's property. For example, if the door is a `stop`, but there's a `rule 'door' 1 left and 5 up` which would be (-1,5). Not sure. 

Another idea: The `win` rule is at (0,6). If the player can make themselves `win`, that would solve it. Since ""baba is you,"" and if there's a rule like ""win is [something]"", maybe the player can create a new rule that makes baba win. For example, move the `win` rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to form ""baba is win"". 

Looking at the current rules, there's a `rule 'is'` at (-1,6) (since it's 1 step left and 6 up from the player's position at (-10,0), so -10 +1 = -9 left? Wait, maybe the coordinates are absolute. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move the `win` rule closer to ""baba"" and ""is"" to create a new rule. For example, if there's a `rule 'is'` at (1 left,6 up), and `win` is at 6 up, then moving the `win` next to the `is` and `baba` text blocks would create ""baba is win"". 

In the current observation, the `rule 'win'` is at 6 step up, which is directly above the player's position (since the player is at -10,0 and the `win` is at 0,6). There's a `rule 'is'` at 1 left and 6 up, which would be at (-9,6) if the player is at (-10,0). The `rule 'baba'` is at 10 left, which is (-20,0)? Wait, no. Maybe the positions are relative to the player. 

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the `win` object by moving right and up. Since the player is at (-10,0), moving right 10 steps would get to (0,0), but there are walls at (-5,6) and others blocking the path. Alternatively, use the key to unlock the door. 

The key is at (-9,6). If the player can move the key to the door's position (-8,6), they can use it to open the door. But how to move the key? The player needs to move the key block, which is not defined as stop. The `stop` rule is at (-8,5), which is below the door. So the key at (-9,6) can be moved. 

So the plan is: move right from the player's position (-10,0) towards the key at (-9,6). But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From (-10,0), moving right once gets to (-9,0). Is there a wall there? The walls are at (-5,6), (-5,5), etc. So from (-10,0) to (-9,6), need to move right and up. But there's a wall at (-5,6), which is much closer. Maybe need to go around. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to manipulate the rules. For example, create a new rule that removes the stop property from the door or makes the door a win. 

Looking at the available text blocks:

- `rule 'is'` is at various positions. For example, at (-1,6), (-9,2 steps down), etc.
- `rule 'win'` is at (0,6).
- `rule 'baba'` is at (-20,0) if 10 steps left from player at (-10,0).

To create a new rule ""baba is win"", the player needs to move the `win` text block next to `baba` and `is`. The `baba` text block is at (-20,0), `is` is at (-9,6), and `win` is at (0,6). The distance is quite large. Maybe it's not feasible. 

Alternatively, use the existing `is` rule at (-1,6) (1 left,6 up from player's position at (-10,0) would be (-9,6)). So if the player can move the `win` rule from (0,6) to be next to `baba` (-20,0) and `is` (-9,6), that's a long distance. 

Alternatively, move the `you` rule (which is at 8 left, which would be (-8,0) if the player is at (-10,0)) to combine with `baba` and `is` to make ""baba is you"", but that's already the active rule. 

Maybe the solution is to move the `win` rule closer. For example, move the `win` rule down to be next to the `is` rule. The `win` is at (0,6), `is` is at (-9,6). If the player moves the `win` rule left 9 steps, it would be next to `is`. But that's a lot of steps. 

Alternatively, check if there's a door that can be made into a win. The door is at (-8,6), and there's a `rule 'door'` at (-1,5) (1 left,5 up from player's position). If the player can move the `door` text block next to the `win` rule, creating ""door is win"", then the door would become the win condition. But the player would need to reach that area. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest valid action is to move right towards the `is` rule to manipulate it. The last valid action was 'right', but the system kept failing. Maybe need to adjust. 

Looking at the previous attempts, the assistant kept outputting 'right' but it failed. Maybe the correct action now is 'up' to reach the higher rules. Alternatively, 'left' to get closer to the `is` rule. 

Wait, the latest observation shows the `win` rule at 6 step up, which is directly above the player's position if the player is at 0,0. But the player's position isn't explicitly stated. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, since the active rule is ""baba is you"", the player can move any object that's not stop. The `stop` rule is at (-8,5), so anything at (-8,5) is stop. The door is at (-8,6), which is not stop. So the player can move the door. If the player moves the door to the `win` position, then standing on the door would make them win. 

But how to move the door? The door is an object, and since it's not stop, the player can move it. The player's current position is likely at (-10,0), based on the `rule 'baba'` being 10 steps left. To move the door from (-8,6) to, say, (0,6) where the `win` is, the player needs to move it right 8 steps and down 0. But that's a long way. 

Alternatively, the player can move the `win` rule to the door's position. If the `win` rule is moved to (-8,6), then the door becomes the win condition. 

The `win` rule is at (0,6). To move it left 8 steps to (-8,6), the player needs to move left 8 times. But that's tedious. 

Alternatively, check if there's a key that can be used. The key is at (-9,6). If the player picks up the key and uses it on the door, but in Baba Is You, using a key on a door typically involves pushing the key into the door, which might require specific rule manipulations. 

Another approach: Since the player is ""baba is you"", they can create a new rule by combining text blocks. For example, if there's a `rule 'is'` next to `baba` and `win`, it becomes ""baba is win"". 

The `baba` text block is at (-20,0), `is` is at (-9,6), and `win` is at (0,6). The distance between them is quite large. Maybe the player needs to move the `win` rule closer to `baba`. 

But how? The player can move the `win` rule by pushing it with their movement. Since the player is at (-10,0), moving up and right towards the `win` rule at (0,6). Each move would shift the `win` rule accordingly. For example, moving up once would place the `win` rule at (0,7), but that's not helpful. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, when you push an object, it moves in the direction you're facing, and the text blocks attached to it move with it. 

So if the player is at (-10,0) and moves up, they can push the `win` rule up if it's in their path. But the `win` rule is at (0,6), which is to the right and up from the player. 

This is really challenging without a visual map. Given the previous actions failed, perhaps the correct action now is to move 'up' to reach higher tiles where the rules are located, or 'left' to get closer to the `is` rule. 

Alternatively, since the last valid action was 'right' and it failed, maybe try 'down' to see if that's possible. 

But according to the latest observation, after moving right multiple times, the player is now at a position where the next move should be towards the `win` rule. 

Given the confusion in positions, perhaps the best guess is to continue moving 'right' to approach the `is` and `win` rules. Alternatively, 'up' to reach higher up where the `win` rule is located. 

Another possibility: The `win` rule is at 6 step up, which is directly above the player's current position. So moving up 6 times would reach it. But the player might be blocked by walls. 

In the current observation, the walls are at (-5,6), (-5,5), etc. So from (-10,0), moving up 6 steps would reach (-10,6). Is there a wall there? The wall at (-5,6) is to the right, so the player would have to move right past (-5,6), which is blocked by a wall. 

This seems impossible. Therefore, the only way is to manipulate the rules. The most straightforward way is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the `win` rule next to `baba` and `is`. 

Given the positions:

- `baba` rule: (-20,0)
- `is` rule: (-9,6)
- `win` rule: (0,6)

The player needs to move the `win` rule left 10 steps to (-10,6) to be next to the `is` rule at (-9,6), but that's still not adjacent to `baba`. 

Alternatively, move the `is` rule to the left to be next to `baba`. The `is` rule is at (-9,6). Moving it left 11 steps would reach (-20,6), adjacent to `baba` at (-20,0). Not helpful. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that the `win` rule is already in place, and by being ""baba is you"", the player can just move to the `win` object. But how? 

Wait, in Baba Is You, if the rule is ""win is [something]"", then touching that something wins. If the rule is ""baba is you"" and ""win is door"", then touching the door wins. If the rule is ""win is flag"", then touching the flag wins. 

In the current observation, the `win` rule is present but not paired with anything. So the default win condition might still be touching the original win object, which might be at a different location not listed here. 

Alternatively, the win condition could be defined by another rule. For example, if there's a rule ""flag is win"", then touching the flag wins. But in the current objects, there's no flag mentioned. 

Given all this, perhaps the correct action is to move towards the `win` rule, which is at 6 step up. So moving 'up' as much as possible. But the previous attempts kept failing. 

Alternatively, since the player is ""baba is you"", they can move any object. If they can move the `win` rule to their position, then they would win. To do that, they need to be adjacent to the `win` rule and push it. 

The `win` rule is at (0,6). The player is at (-10,0). To move the `win` rule, the player would need to be next to it and push it. But that's 10 steps right and 6 steps up, which is impossible in one move. 

This is really frustrating. Maybe the answer is to 'up' to get closer to the higher rules. 

After several failed attempts, the assistant needs to choose an action. Given the latest observation, the player is likely stuck, and the only valid action is to 'up' to try reaching the `win` rule's location. 

So the final action is 'up'.

63,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move Baba around. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object or whatever is defined as WIN. Looking at the current observation, the WIN rule is at 5 step up. There's a door at 8 step to the left and 5 step up, which might be the door we need to open.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 9 step to the left and 5 step up. Wait, but in the current observation, the key is now at 9 step to the left and 5 step up, same as the door. But the door is probably locked, so we need the key. However, the key is in the same position as the door? That seems odd. Maybe I need to check the previous steps. Oh, right, in earlier observations, the key was moving towards the left and up each time. Now it's at 9 step left and 5 step up. The door is at 8 step left and 5 step up. So the key is one step left of the door. 

But how do I get the key? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move towards the key. If I move left, I can reach the key. But wait, there's a wall at 5 step left and 5 step up. So moving left from my current position (which is probably near the key) might hit a wall. Alternatively, maybe I need to pick up the key by moving onto it. Since the key is an object, and I'm Baba who is you, picking up the key would mean moving to the same position as the key. 

Looking at the current positions, the key is at 9 step left and 5 step up. If I move left once, I would reach the key. Let me check the movement directions. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. Since the key is to the left, moving left should get me there. But I need to make sure there's no wall blocking the path. The wall is at 5 step left and 5 step up, which is way to the right of the key's position. So moving left from my current position (which is probably near the key's previous locations) should be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is already in my possession, but no, the key is listed as an object on the map, so I need to move onto it. Once I step on the key, does that do anything? In Baba Is You, picking up a key might require being on the same tile as the key. So moving left to get the key makes sense. After getting the key, I could use it to open the door. But the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" which means it's blocking the path unless we change the rule. 

Wait, the active rules include ""door is stop,"" so the door is immovable. To get past the door, I might need to change the rule to make door not stop. Or maybe there's another way. Alternatively, if I can make the door a win condition, but that's probably more complex. 

Another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can change the rule to make ""door is win"" or something like that. But for that, I need to find a rule text block and rearrange it. The rule `is` is present at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 5 step up. If I can move that rule next to the door and the win keyword, I could create a new rule. 

But first, I need to navigate to those rule text blocks. The `is` rule at 1 step left and 5 step up is close to the door. If I can move that `is` next to the door and the win rule, which is at 5 step up, maybe I can form ""door is win."" To do that, I might need to move the `is` rule to be adjacent to both the door and the win rule. 

Alternatively, the existing rule `win` is at 5 step up, but where is that located? Looking at the objects, the `win` rule is at 5 step up, but the exact position isn't clear. Maybe it's somewhere above. To create a new rule, I need to have the structure ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So if I can get a text block for door, an `is`, and a text block for win together, I can make ""door is win."" 

But this requires moving those text blocks. Let's see the available rules. There's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 5 step up, and another `is` at 7 step left and 2 step up. The `win` rule is at different positions, but in the current observation, it's at 5 step up, but the exact horizontal position isn't specified. 

Alternatively, maybe the easiest way is to move towards the key to pick it up, then use the key to open the door. But since the door is a stop, and I'm Baba (you), I can push past it if I'm adjacent? Wait, in Baba Is You, if you're a pusher, you can push STOP objects. But the default is that you can't push unless you have the PUSH property. Since the only active rule is ""baba is you,"" and there's no ""baba is push"" or similar, I can't push the door. So the door is blocking the path. 

Therefore, to get past the door, I need to either remove the ""door is stop"" rule or change it to something else. To remove a rule, I need to move the text blocks that form it apart. The ""door is stop"" rule is likely made by the text blocks ""door,"" ""is,"" and ""stop"" being adjacent. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""door is"" part, that rule would be broken. 

Looking at the current objects, the rule `door` is at 1 step to the left and 5 step up, the `is` is at 1 step left and 5 step up, and the `stop` is at 8 step left and 4 step up. So the ""door is stop"" rule is formed by the door, is, and stop text blocks not being adjacent. Wait, maybe they are not in the same position. In Baba Is You, rules are formed when the text blocks are in the same row or column. So if ""door"" is above ""is"" which is above ""stop,"" that would form ""door is stop."" 

In the current observation, the `door` rule is at 1 step left and 5 step up, the `is` rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up, and the `stop` rule is at 8 step left and 4 step up. So they are not in the same vertical or horizontal line, so the ""door is stop"" rule isn't active? Wait, but the active rules still show ""door is stop."" That's confusing. Maybe the positions are such that they are adjacent in some way. 

Alternatively, maybe the rules are parsed from the objects on the map. The active rules listed are ""baba is you,"" and the others are part of the static level setup. But in this case, the user is providing both active rules and objects, so perhaps the active rules are the ones that are currently formulated by the text blocks' positions. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's recap: the goal is to reach the WIN condition. The WIN is currently at 5 step up, but where exactly? There's a rule `win` at 5 step up, but the object might be elsewhere. Alternatively, the WIN could be a tile marked as win, which is separate from the rule. 

Assuming the WIN is a tile that I need to step on, and it's currently at a position that's blocked by the door. So the path is door (stop) blocking the way. To get past, either remove the door's stop property or change the win condition. 

Changing the win condition: if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on Baba would make me win. But to do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"" by moving the text blocks together. There's a `baba` rule at 10 step left and 3 steps down, an `is` rule at 7 step left and 3 steps down, and a `win` rule at 2 steps right. So if I can move the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks into adjacent positions, I can create ""baba is win."" 

But how to reach those positions? My current position is near the key and door area. To get to the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks, I would need to move down and left. However, there are walls at 5 step left and various positions down, which might block movement. 

Alternatively, maybe the easiest way is to pick up the key and use it to open the door. But since the door is a stop, and I don't have a key rule yet, I don't think that's possible. Unless the key is used to modify a rule. 

Wait, there's a rule `key` at 2 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move that `key` text block next to another object, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, ""key is win"" or ""key is you."" But I'm not sure. 

Another angle: since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can push objects. But without the PUSH rule, I can't. So pushing the door isn't an option. 

Let me think about the current positions again. The key is at 9 step left and 5 step up. The door is at 8 step left and 5 step up. So the key is to the left of the door. If I move left from my current position (which I assume is near the door), I can reach the key. Once I have the key, perhaps I can place it somewhere to unlock the door. But how? 

In some levels, placing a key on a door unlocks it. But in Baba Is You, that would require the rule ""key is unlock"" or something, which isn't present here. So maybe that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the door's rule can be changed. The existing ""door is stop"" rule is made by the text blocks ""door,"" ""is,"" and ""stop"" being adjacent. If I can move the ""stop"" text block away, the rule would break. The ""stop"" rule is at 8 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block, say, down or right, then the ""door is stop"" rule would no longer exist. 

To move the ""stop"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since I'm Baba (you), and assuming the ""stop"" rule means the text block itself is stop, which makes it immovable. Wait, no: the rule ""stop"" defines that objects with the STOP property cannot be moved. So the text block ""stop"" is likely an object that is STOP, meaning I can't move it. Unless there's a rule that allows moving it. 

Looking at the active rules, there's no rule allowing movement of text blocks except if they are not STOP. Since the ""stop"" text block is probably STOP, I can't move it. So that approach won't work. 

Back to the original idea: pick up the key. If I move left to get the key, that might be the next step. Let's check the path. From my current position (assuming I'm near the door at 8 step left and 5 step up), moving left once would take me to 9 step left and 5 step up, which is where the key is. There's no wall in between, so that should be possible. 

Once I have the key, I can then try to find a way to use it. But without a rule that uses the key, it might not help. Alternatively, maybe the key is a red herring, and the real solution is to change the win condition. 

Looking at the `win` rule, it's currently at 5 step up. There's also a `win` rule at 3 step up and another at 2 step up. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""baba is win,"" then stepping on Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win."" 

The `baba` text block is at 10 step left and 1 step down. The `is` text block is at 9 step left and 1 step down. The `win` text block is at 2 step right. So if I can move the `win` text block to be adjacent to `baba` and `is`, I can form the new rule. 

To do that, I need to move the `win` text block from its current position (which is 2 step right, but the exact coordinates are a bit unclear) to be next to the `baba` and `is` text blocks. However, moving the `win` text block might be possible if it's not defined as STOP. Looking at the objects, the `win` rule is present, but there's no rule stating that win is stop, so maybe it's movable. 

If I can move the `win` text block to the left, towards the `baba` and `is`, then I can create the ""baba is win"" rule. Let's say the `win` rule is currently at 2 steps to the right of some position. If I move it left, then align it with `baba` and `is`, that would work. 

But how to reach that area? My current position is near the door and key. To get to the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks, I would need to move down and left. However, there's a wall at 5 step left, which might block the path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing `is` rules to help. There's an `is` rule at 7 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that `is` next to the `baba` and `win`, but I'm not sure. 

This is getting quite complex. Let's try to prioritize. The immediate goal is to reach the WIN. If I can change the WIN condition to something I can reach, that's the way to go. 

Alternatively, maybe the door isn't the obstacle but just a visual element, and the actual WIN is elsewhere. Looking at the objects, there's a `win` rule at 5 step up, but where is that located? If the WIN is a tile at that position, but blocked by the door, then I need to remove the door's STOP property. 

But since I can't move the `stop` text block, maybe I need to delete the ""door is stop"" rule by separating the text blocks. The ""door is stop"" rule is made by the `door` text block, `is` text block, and `stop` text block being adjacent. Currently, the `door` is at 1 step left and 5 step up, `is` is at 1 step left and 4 step up, and `stop` is at 8 step left and 4 step up. They aren't in the same line, so maybe the rule isn't active. Wait, but the active rules still show ""door is stop."" That's confusing. 

Maybe the level has static rules that are always present, and the ones listed under ""active rules"" are the currently formulated rules based on the text blocks' positions. So even if the text blocks are not adjacent, if they were part of the initial setup, they might remain as active rules. But that doesn't make sense. In Baba Is You, active rules are dynamically created based on the text blocks' positions. 

This suggests that perhaps the ""door is stop"" rule is still active because the text blocks are in a position that forms the rule. For example, if `door` is above `is`, which is above `stop`, that would create ""door is stop."" In the current observation, the `door` is at 1 step left and 5 step up, `is` is at 1 step left and 4 step up, and `stop` is at 8 step left and 4 step up. So the `door` and `is` are in the same column but different rows, while `stop` is in a different column. That wouldn't form a horizontal or vertical rule, so the ""door is stop"" rule shouldn't be active. But it is listed as an active rule. 

This inconsistency makes it tricky. Maybe there's a mistake in the observation data, or perhaps the rules are parsed differently. Assuming that the ""door is stop"" rule is still active, the door remains a STOP, blocking the path. 

Given that, the best approach might be to focus on changing the win condition. To do that, I need to create ""baba is win."" The `baba` text block is at 10 step left and 1 step down, the `is` at 9 step left and 1 step down, and the `win` at some position. In the current observation, the `win` rule is at 5 step up, but its horizontal position isn't specified. 

Assuming the `win` text block is near the top, maybe I can move it down to align with `baba` and `is`. If I can move the `win` text block leftwards, perhaps I can place it next to the `is` and `baba` text blocks. 

To move the `win` text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. If the `win` is at 5 step up, but where horizontally? If it's to the right of the `is` text block, moving it left would bring it closer. 

Alternatively, there's a `win` rule at 3 step up and another at 2 step up. Maybe one of those is movable. 

This is quite challenging without a clear map of positions. Given the time I've spent and the previous actions, maybe the best immediate move is to move left to pick up the key, then see if I can use it or find another way. 

Alternatively, move down towards the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks to try creating the new rule. 

Considering the previous actions where moving down and right were tried, perhaps moving down again could lead towards the rule text blocks. 

Looking at the current observation, after moving up previously, the key is now at 9 step left and 5 step up, door at 8 step left and 5 step up. If I move left from my current position (assuming I'm at the door's position), I can reach the key. 

So the chosen action would be to move left to grab the key.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. So, in Baba Is You, the goal is usually to get to the ""WIN"" object, which is often a door or something similar. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move and manipulate other objects by pushing them or moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""key"" located at 9 steps left and 5 steps up. There's also a ""door"" at 8 steps left and 5 steps up. The ""win"" object is directly above the door at 5 steps up. But between me (Baba) and the door, there's a wall at 5 steps left and 5 steps up. Wait, no—the wall is at 5 steps left and 6 steps up initially, but maybe that's changed. Let me check again.

Wait, the current observation shows the key at 9 left, 5 up; door at 8 left, 5 up. The wall is at 5 left, 5 up. So the door is right next to the key. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps up, same as the door. So normally, to win, I need to get to the door, but there's a wall blocking the path. But since I can manipulate rules, maybe I can change the ""wall"" to something else or make myself able to pass through it.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule ""wall 10 left and 4 up"", which probably defines another wall. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 8 left, 4 up. But how do I get past the wall at 5 left, 5 up? Well, if I can change the ""wall"" property, maybe make it ""floor"" or remove it. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" text block somewhere else or replace it.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 6 up. So if I move that ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" text block, I can change its property. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"", then walls would become stop, but that might not help. Or maybe change ""wall is"" to something else. Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you"". If I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", that might allow me to move past it.

But how do I get to the ""is"" rule? The ""is"" rule is at 1 left, 6 up. My current position (Baba) is at 10 left, 1 down. So I need to move left and down to reach the ""is"" rule. Let's see the movement required. From Baba's position (10 left, 1 down) to the ""is"" rule at 1 left, 6 up: that's 9 steps left and 7 steps up. That's a lot, but maybe possible by moving left multiple times and up.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's another ""is"" at 7 left, 2 steps down. Hmm, not sure. Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `is` 5 step to the left"" – maybe that's another ""is"" block somewhere. Let me parse the objects again.

Objects on the map:

- key 9 left, 5 up
- door 8 left, 5 up
- wall 5 left, 5 up
- rule `is` 1 left, 6 up
- rule `win` 6 up
- rule `wall` 10 left, 4 up
- rule `stop` 8 left, 4 up
- wall 5 left, 4 up
- rule `door` 1 left, 5 up
- wall 5 left, 4 up
- rule `ball` 2 left, 4 up
- rule `is` 1 left, 4 up
- rule `is` 7 left, 3 up
- wall 5 left, 3 up
- rule `win` 3 up
- wall 5 left, 2 up
- rule `key` 2 up
- wall 5 left, 1 up
- rule `baba` 10 left
- rule `is` 9 left
- rule `you` 8 left
- wall 5 left, 1 down

So the ""is"" rules are at various positions. The closest ""is"" to Baba (10 left) is the one at 9 left (rule `is` 9 left) which is on the same horizontal line. If I can move left once to reach that ""is"" rule, maybe I can manipulate it.

But wait, Baba's position is at 10 left. The ""rule `is` 9 left"" is 1 step to the left of Baba. So if I move left once, I would be next to that ""is"" rule. Then, if I can push it or move it to attach to another text block, like the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 10 left, 4 up. So if I move the ""is"" rule from 9 left to 10 left (where the ""wall"" rule is), then I can create a new rule like ""wall is [something]"". For example, if I move the ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule, then combining them would make ""wall is [next property]"". But what property do I want?

The goal is to remove the wall blocking the path. If I can make the wall a ""stop"", but ""stop"" is already a rule at 8 left, 4 up. Not sure. Alternatively, if I can make the wall ""push"" or ""lose"", but that might not help. Alternatively, change the ""win"" condition to something else. Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 6 up. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching anything would win, but that's risky.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the ""win"" rule to be under my control. For example, make ""baba is win"", which would mean touching Baba (me) would make me win. But how?

Alternatively, go to the ""key"" and pick it up, but there's a door mapped to the key. Not sure. The door is at 8 left, 5 up, which is next to the key. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to open the door. But how? The door's rule is at 1 left, 5 up (rule `door` 1 left, 5 up). If I can change that door rule to be ""door is key"", then having the key would open the door. But I need to interact with the door's rule.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

Current active rule: ""baba is you"" – so I can move and push things.

Obstacles:

- A wall at 5 left, 5 up blocking the path to the door/win.

Possible solutions:

1. Remove the wall by changing its property. To do this, need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and redefine it.

2. Make the wall passable by changing it to ""floor"" or similar, but I don't see a ""floor"" rule.

3. Change the ""win"" condition to be under my control, so touching something makes me win.

4. Use the key to open the door by redefining the door's rule.

Let me try solution 1. The ""wall"" rule is at 10 left, 4 up. The closest ""is"" rule is at 9 left (rule `is` 9 left). If I move left once to reach that ""is"" rule, then move it down to 4 up to attach to the ""wall"" rule. So from 9 left to 10 left (moving right once?), but wait, Baba is at 10 left. So moving left from 10 left would take me to 9 left, which is where the ""is"" rule is. Then, I can move that ""is"" rule down to 4 up to attach to the ""wall"" rule.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule at 9 left.

2. Move down from 9 left to 4 up (the position of the ""wall"" rule at 10 left, 4 up). But how? The ""is"" rule is at 9 left, 3 up initially? Wait, looking at the observation:

The ""rule `is` 9 step to the left"" – that's probably at 9 left, same horizontal line as Baba. The ""wall"" rule is at 10 left, 4 up. So to get from 9 left to 10 left, I need to move right once. Then from 4 up, which is down one step from the current position of the ""is"" rule at 9 left, 3 up? Wait, the ""is"" rule at 9 left is listed as ""rule `is` 5 step to the left"" – maybe I'm misinterpreting the positions.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again carefully.

Each object's position is described as ""[Subject] [X] step [direction] and [Y] step [direction]"". For example, ""key 7 step to the left and 3 step up"" means the key is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up from the reference point (probably Baba's position).

But since all positions are relative to Baba, maybe we need to consider where Baba is located. The observation lists Baba as ""rule `baba` 10 step to the left and 3 steps down"". Wait, no, looking at the current observation:

Objects on the map include ""rule `baba` 10 step to the left and 1 step down"". So Baba is at a position that is 10 steps to the left and 1 step down from the reference point. But the reference point is likely the starting position, and all other objects are positioned relative to that.

This is making it a bit tricky to visualize the grid. Maybe it's better to focus on the relative positions of the key, door, walls, and rules.

The key is at 9 left, 5 up from Baba. The door is at 8 left, 5 up. The wall is at 5 left, 5 up. The ""win"" rule is at 5 up, same as the door. So to reach the door, I need to get past the wall at 5 left, 5 up.

The ""is"" rule that's closest is at 9 left (rule `is` 9 left), which is 1 step to the left of Baba's position (10 left). So if I move left once, I can get to that ""is"" rule. Then, if I can move it down to attach to the ""wall"" rule at 10 left, 4 up.

So moving steps:

1. From Baba's position (10 left, 1 down), move left once to reach the ""is"" rule at 9 left.

2. Now, need to move this ""is"" rule down to 4 up. The current position of the ""is"" rule is at 9 left, but where exactly? If the ""is"" rule is at 9 left and, say, 3 up (since the wall is at 5 left, 5 up), then moving down from there to 4 up would require moving up one step? Wait, this is getting too confusing without a visual map.

Alternative approach: Since the goal is to get to the door (which is at 8 left, 5 up), and there's a wall at 5 left, 5 up, perhaps I can change the ""wall"" rule to something else. For example, make ""wall is push"", which would let me push the wall out of the way. To do that, I need to attach the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 10 left, 4 up. The ""is"" rule I can reach is at 9 left. So if I move right once from 9 left to 10 left (reaching the ""wall"" rule's x position), then move up to 4 up. So from 9 left, 3 up (assuming the ""is"" rule's position) to 10 left, 4 up. That would involve moving right once and up once.

Once the ""is"" rule is next to the ""wall"" rule, combining them would create ""wall is [next property]"". If I set it to ""wall is push"", then I can push the wall aside. Then, I can move past it to the door.

So the actions needed would be:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule at 9 left.

2. Move right once to get to 10 left (same x as the ""wall"" rule).

3. Move up once to align with the ""wall"" rule at 4 up.

4. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the ""wall"" rule, creating ""wall is push"".

5. Then, move left to the wall at 5 left, 5 up, push it aside.

6. Proceed to the door at 8 left, 5 up and the ""win"" rule.

But how do I know the exact steps between positions? Since all movements are relative, I need to calculate the directional steps.

Alternatively, since the ""is"" rule is at 9 left and the ""wall"" rule is at 10 left, 4 up, the movement from 9 left to 10 left is right, and from the current ""is"" position (which is at 9 left, perhaps 3 up) to 4 up is up. So the actions would be: right, up.

After moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, the new rule would be ""wall is push"". Then, I can move to the wall at 5 left, 5 up, push it left or right, perhaps out of the way.

Once the wall is moved, I can go to the door and touch it, winning the level.

Alternatively, if I can change the ""win"" rule to be under my control. For example, make ""baba is win"", so touching anything makes me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps up, and the ""baba"" rule is at 10 left, 1 down. So moving from Baba's position (10 left, 1 down) to the ""win"" rule at 5 up would require moving up 4 steps. But there's a wall at 5 left, 5 up blocking the path. So that might not be feasible unless the wall is removed.

Another option: Use the ""key"" to open the door. The door's rule is at 1 left, 5 up. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is key"", then having the key would allow passage. To do that, I need to interact with the door's rule.

But getting the key requires moving past the wall. This seems circular.

Back to the first plan: Changing the wall to push.

So, step-by-step actions:

1. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule at 9 left.

2. Move right once to get to 10 left (same x as the ""wall"" rule).

3. Move up once to align with the ""wall"" rule at 4 up.

4. Now, the ""is"" rule is adjacent to the ""wall"" rule, creating ""wall is push"".

5. Move left to the wall at 5 left, 5 up. Since the wall is now ""push"", I can push it. To push it, I need to move in the opposite direction it should go. For example, if I push it left, it would move to 4 left, 5 up.

6. After pushing the wall aside, move right to the door at 8 left, 5 up and touch it, winning the level.

But how to translate this into the required actions (up, down, left, right)?

Assuming that after moving the ""is"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule, the player can then move to the wall's position and push it. The exact sequence would involve:

- From Baba's initial position (10 left, 1 down):

   a. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule at 9 left.

   b. Move right once to 10 left.

   c. Move up once to 4 up.

   d. Now, the ""is"" rule is next to the ""wall"" rule, creating ""wall is push"".

   e. Move left three times from 10 left to reach 7 left (the wall's position at 5 left, 5 up? Wait, this is getting confusing without knowing the exact grid layout.)

Alternatively, after redefining the wall to be push, the player can move left to the wall's location and push it. For example, from 10 left, 4 up (where the ""is"" and ""wall"" rules are now), move left to 9 left, 4 up, then down to 5 up (the wall's position), then push left.

But this requires precise movement. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move left towards the ""is"" rule to start manipulating the rules.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the win condition in Baba Is You. The active rule right now is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate other objects by moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key and a door. The win condition is probably the door, but I need to figure out how to get past it. The door is 7 steps to the left and 5 steps up from where I am. There are walls blocking the path, and some rules like ""wall is stop,"" which means walls are immovable. 

The key is located at 8 steps left and 5 steps up. Maybe picking up the key can help, but I don't see a rule that says ""key is win"" or anything. Alternatively, maybe there are rules I can change. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. For example, there's a rule `is` at 5 steps up, and another at 3 steps up. If I can move those ""is"" blocks to create new rules, like ""door is key"" or ""key is win,"" that might change things.

But first, I need to navigate. The current position of Baba is at 9 steps to the left and 1 step down. The door is 7 steps left and 5 up. So to reach the door, I need to move left and up. However, there are walls in the way. The walls are at 4, 5, 8, etc., steps left, which might block my path. Since walls are STOP, I can't push them, but maybe I can rearrange the rules to make them not walls.

Looking at the rules, there's ""wall is stop"" at 9 steps left and 4 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule elsewhere or change it to something else, maybe the walls become passable. Alternatively, maybe create a rule like ""wall is you,"" making walls controllable. But how?

The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. For instance, there's an ""is"" at 1 step left and 6 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""you,"" I could make ""baba is you"" again, but that's already active. Maybe I need to create a new rule like ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block next to key and win. The win is at 2 steps right and 5 step up. The key is at 9 step left and 5 step up. So if I can move the ""is"" block between them, that might work.

But how to get to that ""is"" block? The closest ""is"" is at 1 step left and 6 step up. My current position is 9 step left and 1 step down. So to reach the ""is"" block at 1 left, 6 up, I need to move right and up. However, moving right from 9 left would make me less left, which might be towards the center. But there are walls at 5 step left, which are STOP. So maybe I need to find another path.

Alternatively, there's another ""is"" at 3 step up. Maybe moving that. But again, pathfinding is tricky with walls. Let's see. If I move up from my current position (9 left, 1 down), there's a rule `win` at 1 step right and 5 step up. Maybe moving towards that. But the door is at 7 left and 5 up, which is closer horizontally. 

Wait, the key is at 8 left and 5 up. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to open the door. But how? Unless there's a rule that says ""key is unlock"" or something. But the only rules are the ones listed. 

Another angle: The ""you"" rule is at 7 step left and 1 step down. If I can make myself ""you"" by moving the ""you"" text next to me, but I'm already ""baba is you."" Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I am both Baba and You. That means I can push objects that are not STOP. But walls are STOP, so I can't push them. 

Looking at the objects, the rule `is` at 1 step to the right and 6 step up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win,"" then maybe create ""key is win."" But how to reach there? My current position is 9 left, 1 down. To get to the ""is"" at 1 right and 6 up, I need to move right 10 steps and up 6 steps, which seems impossible given the map layout. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to change the ""door"" rule. The rule `door` is at 1 step left and 5 step up. If I can move that ""door"" text and make it something else, like ""door is key,"" then stepping on the door would be equivalent to stepping on a key. But again, navigation is key here. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the ""win"" rule closer. The `win` is at 2 steps right and 5 step up. If I can make the win condition something else, like Baba itself, but the rule is ""baba is you,"" so maybe ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The `baba` rule is at 9 left and 1 down. The `win` rule is at 2 right and 5 up. So I need to move the ""is"" block between them. 

To do that, I need to move right and up. Let's see. From current position (9 left, 1 down), moving right 10 steps would get to 9-10= -1 left? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. The key is 9 step to the left, which means it's positioned 9 units to the left of the origin. So moving right would decrease the left steps. For example, if I'm at 9 left and move right once, I'm at 8 left. 

So to reach the `win` rule at 2 right and 5 up, which is 2 units to the right (so 7 left from origin) and 5 up. My current position is 9 left and 1 down. So to get to 7 left and 5 up, I need to move left 2 steps and up 6 steps. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 5 left and 5 up, which is between me and the door. Also, walls at 4,5,8 left at various levels. This seems challenging. Maybe I need to use the ""is"" blocks to create new rules that override the STOP property. 

For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""stop"" rule somewhere else. The `stop` rule is at 8 left and 4 up. If I move that `stop` rule away, then walls might become passable. But how to move it? To move a rule, I need to be adjacent to it and it's not STOP. The `stop` rule is at 8 left,4 up. My position is 9 left,1 down. To reach there, I need to move left 1 step (to 8 left) and up 3 steps. But there's a wall at 5 left and 5 up, but I'm at 9 left initially. Wait, maybe the path isn't blocked. Let me map this out. 

From 9 left,1 down:
- Move left to 8 left,1 down.
- Then up to 8 left,2 down (but down increases the down steps? Maybe the coordinate system is left, right, up, down from the origin. So moving up decreases the down steps. This is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of directions. 

Assuming that moving up from 9 left,1 down would take me to 9 left,0 down, then 9 left,-1 down (which is up). But the exact coordinate system isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe the positions are absolute. For example, the key is at position (x,y) = (7,-6) if left is negative x and down is negative y. But this is getting too abstract. 

Alternatively, focus on relative movements. The `stop` rule is at 8 left,4 up. My position is 9 left,1 down. To reach the `stop` rule, I need to move left once (to 8 left) and up three times (to 4 up). But between me and there, are there any walls? The walls are at 4,5,8 left at various levels. At 8 left,4 up, there's a wall (rule `wall` at 10 left,5 up, but that's different). Wait, the wall at 8 left and 4 up is part of the `stop` rule's position. So moving to 8 left,4 up would be next to the `stop` rule. 

If I can get to that spot, I can move the `stop` rule. Since `stop` is a property, and the rule is ""rule `stop` 8 step to the left and 4 step up,"" to move it, I need to be adjacent to it and not be STOP. But since I'm Baba and I'm You, maybe I can move it. Once moved, the walls might no longer be STOP, allowing me to push them or pass through. 

So the plan would be:
1. Move from current position (9 left,1 down) to the `stop` rule at 8 left,4 up.
2. Move the `stop` rule to a new position, say, next to a wall, changing its property.
3. Then navigate past the walls to the door or key.

But how to move step by step. From 9 left,1 down:
- Move left to 8 left,1 down.
- Then up three times to 8 left,4 up (which is the `stop` rule's position).
- Once there, move the `stop` rule. Since it's a text block, I can move it if it's not STOP. Wait, the `stop` rule defines that walls are STOP. If the `stop` rule is moved, does that remove the STOP property from walls? Maybe. So if I move the `stop` rule away, then walls wouldn't be STOP anymore. 

Assuming that's possible, once `stop` is moved, I could push walls or move through them. Then I could go around the walls to reach the door or key. 

Alternatively, create a rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the `is` block next to `baba` and `win`. The `win` rule is at 2 right and5 up from the key's position. But the exact positions are a bit confusing. 

Another approach: The key is at 8 left,5 up. If I can get to the key, maybe the rule `key` is at 2 steps right and1 step up from the `win` rule. If I pick up the key (by moving the `key` rule next to me?), but I don't know if that's how it works. In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks adjacent to you to create new rules. So if I'm next to the `key` rule, I can move it to create a new rule, like ""key is win."" 

So steps:
1. Move to the `key` rule at9 left,5 up (which is the key's position).
Wait, the key's position is 9 step to the left and5 step up. My current position is9 left,1 down. So to reach the key, I need to move up4 steps and stay at the same left position. But there's a wall at5 left and5 up, but I'm at9 left, so maybe the path is clear. 

From 9 left,1 down:
- Move up four times to reach9 left,5 up (the key's position).
- Once there, since the key is a text block, I can move it. Then place it next to the `win` rule to create ""key is win.""

The `win` rule is at2 steps right and5 step up from where the key is. Wait, the `win` rule's position is6 step up. The key is at5 step up. So moving the key to be adjacent to the `win` rule would require moving it right or left. 

If I move the key one step to the right (to8 left,5 up), and place it next to the `win` rule which is at2 steps right and5 step up. Wait, the `win` rule's position is6 step up. So maybe the `win` rule is at6 step up, same as the door and key. 

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the possible actions again.

Current active rule: baba is you.

Possible actions: move up, down, left, right, or idle. But to do anything meaningful, need to move text blocks.

The key is at9 left,5 up. The `win` rule is at6 step up. So if I can create ""key is win,"" then stepping on the key would make it a win condition.

To create ""key is win,"" I need to move the `is` rule next to `key` and `win`.

The `is` rules are at:
- 1 step left and6 step up
- 3 step up
- 7 step left and2 step up

The closest `is` is at7 step left and2 step up, which is not in the same row as the key and win.

Alternatively, the `is` at1 step left and6 step up. My position is9 left,1 down. To reach that `is`, I need to move left1 step (to8 left) and up5 steps (to6 up). But there's a wall at5 left and5 up, but I'm at9 left, so maybe the path is clear.

From current position (9 left,1 down):
- Move left to8 left,1 down.
- Move up five times to8 left,6 up (which is the `is` at1 left,6 up). Wait, the `is` is at1 step left and6 step up. So from8 left,6 up, moving left1 step would reach7 left,6 up. Hmm, maybe not. This is confusing with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the `is` rule's position is relative to the origin. If the key is at9 left,5 up, and the `is` is at1 left,6 up, then the distance between them is8 left and1 up. So to reach the `is`, I need to move left8 steps and up1 step. But that's a long way, blocked by walls.

This seems difficult. Maybe the intended solution is to move the `you` rule next to Baba to reinforce the ""baba is you"" rule, but that's already active.

Alternatively, create ""door is you"" so that stepping on the door makes me win. To do that, move the `is` block next to `door` and `you`.

The `door` rule is at1 step left and5 step up. The `you` rule is at8 step left and1 step down. So moving the `is` block between them would require significant movement.

Alternatively, since I'm already ""you,"" maybe I can push objects. If I can push the `win` rule to be under me, but `win` is at6 step up, which is above me.

Wait, the `win` rule is at6 step up. My current position is1 down, so if I move up6 steps, I would be at5 up, which is below the `win` rule. Not sure.

Another idea: The rule `ball` is at2 step left and4 step up. Maybe that's a red herring. 

Perhaps the key is not necessary. If I can reach the door and change its rule to be win. The `door` rule is at1 step left and5 step up. If I move the `win` rule next to the door, making ""door is win.""

The `win` rule is at5 step up. The door is at5 step up,1 step left. So if I can move the `win` rule to be adjacent to the door, that would work. 

To do that, I need to move the `win` rule from its current position (which is at6 step up?) Wait, the `win` rule's position is listed as ""rule `win` 6 step up"" in the initial observation, but later it changes. Let me check the latest observation.

In the last observation before the current one, the `win` rule is at5 step up. So it's at the same level as the door and key. The door is at7 step left and5 step up, the `win` rule is at5 step up. To move the `win` rule next to the door, I need to move it left or right.

The `win` rule is currently at5 step up, and its position is described as ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 5 step up"" in one of the observations. So if it's 2 steps to the right of something, maybe the origin is where the initial rules were. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best move is to try to move towards the `is` block that can be used to create a new rule. For example, the `is` at7 step left and2 step up. If I can reach there and combine it with `key` and `win`, but the distances are too great.

Alternatively, the `is` at1 step left and6 step up. If I can move there and create ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make it a win. 

To get to that `is`, from my current position (9 left,1 down), move left1 step to8 left,1 down. Then move up5 steps to8 left,6 up. But there's a wall at5 left and5 up, but I'm at8 left, so maybe path is clear. Once there, move the `is` block next to the key and win.

But how? The key is at9 left,5 up. So from8 left,6 up, move right1 step to9 left,6 up (adjacent to the key), then down1 step to9 left,5 up (the key's position), and place the `is` there next to `key` and `win`. 

This requires precise movements. So step-by-step:

1. Move left from9 left to8 left.
2. Move up five times to8 left,6 up (position of the `is` block).
3. Move right to9 left,6 up (adjacent to the key).
4. Move down to","

66,up,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed. Let me look at the objects.

There's a key somewhere, a door, walls, and some rules like 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop'. The key is at 8 steps left and 5 up. The door is at 7 left and 5 up. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 5 up. Hmm. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps up, and the 'win' rule is to the right of that. So maybe if I can get to the 'win' rule and move it or change it?

But wait, I need to move myself (Baba) to interact with these. Let me check where Baba is. The rule ""baba"" is at 9 steps left and 1 step down. So I'm positioned there. The 'you' rule is at 7 left and 1 down, which might be part of the same spot since Baba is the player.

The plan is probably to reach the 'win' rule. But there are walls in the way. The walls are at various positions. Let me see the path. From Baba's position (9 left, 1 down), looking up, there's a wall at 5 left and 5 up. The 'win' is at 1 right and 5 up from the 'is' rule. So maybe move up to reach the 'win' rule?

Wait, but the 'win' rule is currently at 1 step right and 5 up from the 'is' rule. Let me parse the positions again. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps up. The 'win' rule is 1 step right from there. So if the 'is' is at, say, position (x,5), then 'win' is at (x+1,5). But where exactly is Baba? At (9 left, 1 down). So moving up would take me towards the upper part of the map.

But there's a wall at 4 left and 5 up. So maybe I need to find a way around that. Alternatively, can I change the rules to make walls passable? For example, if I can turn 'wall' into something else, maybe it's not a stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall' rule or modify it.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'wall' rule at 9 left and 4 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the immovable property. But I have to move it without triggering a 'stop' which is at 7 left and 4 up. Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 7 left and 4 up. So if I try to move the 'wall' rule past that, I might hit a stop, which I can't pass through.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes 'baba' to 'win'. For example, if I can write ""baba is win"", then touching the door or whatever would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Baba is at 9 left, 1 down. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps up. Maybe I need to move down to reach the 'is' rule. Wait, the 'is' rule is at 5 steps up from where? The initial position might be arbitrary, but the steps are relative. Let me think in terms of the grid.

Assuming each step is a grid cell, Baba is at (9,1). The 'is' rule is at (some x,5). The 'win' rule is at (x+1,5). To get to the 'win' rule, I need to move up from Baba's position. But there's a wall at (4,5). How to get past that?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to unlock the door. The key is at 8 left,5 up. If I can get to the key, pick it up, and then use it on the door. But the door is at 7 left,5 up. So moving right from the key to the door. But again, there's a wall at 4 left,5 up. Wait, the key is at 8 left,5 up. So from Baba's position (9,1), moving left to 8 left,5 up would pass through some walls?

Wait, perhaps I need to reorient the map. Let's list all the walls and their positions:

- wall 3 step to the left and 4 step up (from initial observations, but now it's updated)
Looking at the current objects:

There's a wall at 5 step to the left and 5 step up. Another at 7 left and 4 up. Also at 4 left and 4 up, 4 left and 3 up, etc. So the path upwards is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the 'stop' rule or change it. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left and 4 up. If I can turn that into something else, maybe the walls become passable.

Alternatively, create a rule that says 'wall is stop', but I think that's already the case. The existing rules include 'wall is you'? No, the active rule is 'baba is you'. The 'wall' rule is at 9 left and 4 up, which defines 'wall' as a property. So 'wall is [property]'.

Wait, the current active rules are just 'baba is you'. The other rules are objects on the map that can be moved. So to create a new rule, I need to move the 'is' rule next to two other objects. For example, move 'is' to 'baba' and 'win' to make 'baba is win'.

Baba's rule is at 9 left and 1 down. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps up. So if I can move down to reach the 'is' rule, then move it next to 'baba' and 'win'.

But how to get there? From Baba's position (9,1), moving down would take me to lower y-coordinates. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps up, which is higher y. So I need to move up. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the 'key' to unlock something. The key is at 8 left,5 up. If I can get to the key, then move it to the door. The door is at 7 left,5 up. So from the key's position (8,5), moving left once reaches the door (7,5). But the door is a 'stop' if there's a 'stop' rule associated. The 'door' rule is at 1 step left and 5 step up. So 'door is [something]'. If it's 'door is stop', then touching it would be bad. But the current active rules only have 'baba is you'.

So if I can reach the door and touch it, since I'm Baba (you), and the door's rule is not 'stop' unless specified, maybe it's passable. But I need to get past the walls first.

Alternatively, create a rule that says 'door is win'. Then touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'door' and 'win'.

The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 5 step up from the 'is' rule. So if I can position the 'is' rule between 'door' and 'win', that would create the rule 'door is win'.

The 'door' is at 7 left,5 up. The 'win' is at 1 step right from the 'is' rule, which is at 5 step up. Let me see the positions:

- 'is' rule is at 5 step up (exact coordinates? Maybe it's at (x,5))
- 'win' rule is at (x+1,5)
- 'door' is at 7 left,5 up. So if I can move the 'is' rule to be between 'door' (7,5) and 'win' (8,5), then 'door is win' would be created.

But how to get the 'is' rule there? The 'is' rule is currently at 5 step up, but where exactly? From the observation, the 'is' rule is at 5 step up. Baba is at 9 left,1 down. So moving up from Baba's position, there are walls blocking the path. Maybe I need to move left or right to reach the 'is' rule.

Alternatively, use the 'key' to move obstacles. But I don't see a 'push' rule, so maybe can't push objects unless they're not 'stop'.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline steps:

1. Move towards the 'is' rule to create new rules.
2. Create a rule that changes 'baba' to 'win' or 'door' to 'win'.
3. Navigate to the door or win object with the new rule.

Alternatively, since 'baba is you', maybe I can just walk to the 'win' rule if possible. But the path is blocked.

Looking at the current positions:

Baba is at 9 left,1 down.

The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 5 step up from the 'is' rule. The 'is' rule is at 5 step up. So if the 'is' is at, say, position (x,5), then 'win' is at (x+1,5). To get there, need to move from (9,1) to (x+1,5). But how?

Alternatively, the 'win' rule's position is directly known. In the current observation, 'win' is at 5 step up. So coordinates might be (some x,5). The 'is' rule is also at 5 step up. So they're in the same horizontal line.

If I can move up to the 'is' and 'win' rules, I can create a new rule. For example, move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win' to make 'baba is win'.

But to do that, I need to navigate to where the 'is' rule is. The 'is' rule is at 5 step up. From Baba's position (9,1), moving up 4 steps would get to y=5. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 left,5 up and others. So maybe need to find a different path.

Alternatively, move left or right to avoid walls. For example, move left from Baba's position (9,1) to 8 left,1 down. Then up to 8 left,5 up. But there's a wall at 8 left,5 up (the door's position?). Wait, the door is at 7 left,5 up. So moving left from 9 to 8 left, then up to 5 up would be at (8,5), which is the key's position. The key is at 8 left,5 up. If I can pick up the key, maybe that helps.

But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can move objects by pushing them if they're not 'stop'. The 'key' is probably not 'stop', so I can move it. But my current goal is to get to the 'win' rule.

Alternatively, move the key to the door and use it to unlock. But I'm not sure how that works in the game mechanics. Maybe the key needs to be on the door's tile to unlock it.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the key (8 left,5 up).
2. Move the key to the door (7 left,5 up).
3. Then the door becomes passable, allowing me to go through it to win.

But to move the key, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, pushing it if possible. Since the key isn't 'stop', I can move it.

From Baba's position (9,1), moving left to 8 left,1 down (same y). Then up to 8 left,5 up (the key's position). Once there, move left to push the key to 7 left,5 up (the door's position). Then move left again into the door, which might now be passable if the key unlocked it.

But I need to check the rules. If the door's rule is 'door is stop', then even with the key, it might still be stop. Unless the key changes the rule. Alternatively, creating a rule that says 'key is unlock', but that's not present here.

Alternatively, after moving the key to the door, the door's rule might change. But I'm not sure. This is a bit of a stretch.

Another approach: create a rule that makes 'baba' equal to 'win'. For that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'.

Baba is at 9 left,1 down. The 'win' rule is at 5 step up. Let's assume 'win' is at (x,5). The 'is' rule is also at 5 step up, say at (y,5). To create 'baba is win', I need to move the 'is' rule to be between 'baba' and 'win'.

But the positions are such that Baba is at (9,1), and 'win' is at (x,5). The distance is quite large. Maybe need to move up through the walls, but they're blocking the path.

Alternatively, find a way to remove the 'wall' rules. For example, move the 'wall' rule to a different position so it doesn't define 'wall' as a property. Then walls become passable.

The 'wall' rule is at 9 left and 4 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule elsewhere, like down below, then the 'wall' property might be removed, making walls passable.

So steps:

1. Move to the 'wall' rule at 9 left,4 up.
2. Move it down to, say, 9 left,3 up.
3. Now, the original 'wall' properties might be gone, making walls passable.

But how to do that? From Baba's position (9,1), need to move up to reach the 'wall' rule at 4 up. So move up 3 times: from 1 to 4. But along the way, are there obstacles?

At y=2, there's a wall at 4 left,2 up. At y=3, wall at 4 left,3 up. At y=4, wall at 5 left,4 up and others. So moving up from Baba's position (9,1) to y=4 would require passing through y=2 and y=3, which have walls. Unless I can move around them.

Alternatively, move left or right to avoid the walls while moving up. For example, move left to 8 left,1 down, then up to 8 left,5 up (the key's position). Then move right to the 'is' rule at 5 step up.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to try to reach the 'win' rule by moving up and left, avoiding walls by using the key and door interaction.

Alternatively, since the previous attempts kept failing, maybe the right action now is to move left towards the 'is' rule or the key.

Looking at the latest observation, after moving right multiple times, the key is now at 9 step to the left and 6 step up. Wait, no, in the last observation, the key is at 9 step to the left and 6 step up. Wait, the way the positions are described is a bit confusing. It says ""key 9 step to the left and 6 step up"". So from the player's position, moving left 9 steps and up 6 gets to the key. But the player is at 10 step to the left and 2 steps down relative to the 'baba' rule. This is a bit confusing in terms of coordinate systems.

Perhaps it's better to think in terms of relative positions. The key is to the left and up from the player. So to reach it, the player should move left and up. But there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, the 'is' rule is at 5 step up. If the player moves up to y=5, they might intersect with the 'is' rule. But the path is blocked.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the best action now is to move up to try to reach the 'win' rule, even if there's a wall, hoping that by changing the rule, the wall becomes passable.

So the chosen action is up.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with other objects by pushing them, right? The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a key to the left and up from me, a door also left and up, walls, and some rules. The ""win"" object is to the right and up at 1 step. But I remember that sometimes the win condition can be changed by moving rules. Let me check where the rules are.

There's a rule `win` at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. Also, there are other rules like `is`, `wall`, `stop`, etc. The key is at 8 left and 4 up, which is directly in my path if I go left. But the door is at 7 left and 4 up, so maybe I need to get past it. However, doors might be stoppable if there's a ""stop"" rule. Let me see if there's a ""stop"" rule nearby. There's a `stop` rule at 7 left and 3 up. So maybe the door is stoppable?

Wait, but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't stopped. But the door might have a ""stop"" property. Let me confirm. The `stop` rule is at 7 left and 3 up. If the door is at 7 left and 4 up, that's one step up from the `stop` rule. But rules apply to objects based on their proximity and the rule's position. I think each rule applies to the nearest object of the specified subject. So the `stop` rule at 7 left and 3 up would apply to the door at 7 left and 4 up, making the door a stop. That means I can't push the door.

So to get past the door, maybe I need to move the key first? The key is at 8 left and 4 up. If I go left, I can reach the key. Once I have the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock the door. But how does that work in Baba Is You? Usually, you need to push a key into a door. But the door here might be a separate object. Let's see the positions:

- Key: 8 left, 4 up
- Door: 7 left, 4 up
So the key is one step to the left of the door. If I can get both the key and the door in positions where I can push them together, maybe that works. But since the door is stopped, I can't push it. So perhaps I need to move the key first by pushing it left. But to push the key, I need to be adjacent to it.

Wait, my current position isn't clear here. The observation shows that the key is 8 steps to the left and 4 up from me. But where am I located? Maybe I'm at a certain coordinate, but the problem is that the observations don't specify my position, just the positions of other objects relative to me. This might make it a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to reach the `win` object at 1 step right and 4 up. But that's blocked by the door. So perhaps I need to change the rule to make the door not a stop or change the win condition. Let's look at the rules again.

There's a `win` rule at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can move that `win` rule to be under a different object, maybe I can make myself the win condition. For example, if I create ""baba is win,"" then touching baba would make me win. To do that, I need to move the `win` text block and combine it with `baba` and `is`.

Looking at the current rules:

- `is` rules are at various positions. For example, there's a `rule `is` 1 step to the right and 6 step up` in previous observations, but in the latest one, the `is` rules are at different positions. The latest observation has an `is` rule at 4 step up, 3 step up, 2 step up, etc.

Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are:

- baba is you

And the objects include several `rule` blocks:

`rule `is` 4 step up` (position: 4 left, 4 up?)

Wait, the exact positions are a bit confusing without knowing my own position. But assuming that the `is` rules are scattered, perhaps I can move them to form new rules.

The key idea is to rearrange text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can take the `win` rule and combine it with `baba` and `is`, making ""baba is win,"" then touching baba would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the `win` text block next to `baba` and `is`. Let's see where those are.

In the current observation, `rule `baba` is at 9 step to the left and 2 steps down. The `is` rule is at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can move the `win` rule (which is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up) next to them, I can form ""baba is win.""

But how to get there? The `win` rule is currently at 1 step right and 4 up. My current position isn't specified, but assuming I need to move up and right to reach that `win` rule.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer `is` rule that I can use. There's an `is` rule at 4 step up. If I can move the `win` rule to be adjacent to `baba` and `is`, that would work.

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the `win` rule at 1 step right and 4 up.
2. Push the `win` rule to the right until it's next to the `baba` and `is` rules.
3. Combine them to create ""baba is win,"" making me the win condition.

But to push the `win` rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction towards the `baba` and `is` rules. The `win` rule is currently at 1 right, 4 up. If I move right, I can get closer to it. However, there's a `key` at 8 left and 4 up, which is in the way if I'm coming from the left.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go up first. Let me check the positions again.

The `win` rule is at 1 step right and 4 up. The `baba` and `is` rules are at 9 left, 2 down and 8 left, 2 down. That's quite far. So moving the `win` rule all the way down there might be difficult.

Another approach: Maybe the door can be made non-stop. If there's a `stop` rule applied to the door, maybe I can remove that. But the `stop` rule is at 7 left and 3 up, which is below the door. To remove the `stop` property from the door, I need to destroy the `stop` rule or move it away. But how? In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks unless they're stopped. So if the `stop` rule is at 7 left and 3 up, and the door is at 7 left and 4 up, then the `stop` rule is not directly on the door. So the door's stop property might come from another rule. Wait, perhaps the `stop` rule is applied to the wall? Let me check.

There's a `wall` at 5 left and 5 up, and a `stop` rule at 8 left and 3 up. Not sure. Alternatively, the door's stop property might be from a different rule. If I can move the `stop` rule away, the door might no longer be stoppable, allowing me to push it.

But moving the `stop` rule would require me to be adjacent to it and push it. The `stop` rule is at 7 left and 3 up. If I can move down to that position and push it left or right, removing it from affecting the door.

Alternatively, maybe the key is necessary to unlock the door, but I don't see a lock object here. So perhaps the key is a red herring, and the real solution is to change the win condition.

Putting it all together, the most promising path seems to be rearranging the `win` rule with `baba` and `is` to make ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the `win` rule to the area where `baba` and `is` are located.

Given the current positions:

- `win` rule: 1 step right, 4 up
- `baba` rule: 9 left, 2 down
- `is` rule: 8 left, 2 down

Assuming that moving the `win` rule down and to the left, towards the `baba` and `is` rules, would allow creating the new rule. So the action would be to move towards the `win` rule, likely by going up and right first to reach it, then pushing it left and down.

But given the step-by-step observations, the previous actions were moving left, right, up, down, etc., and the game seems to be progressing with the key and door positions changing slightly each time. The latest observation after several moves shows the key at 8 left, 4 up, door at 7 left, 4 up, and the `win` at 1 right, 4 up.

So perhaps the correct sequence is to move right to reach the `win` rule, then push it left towards the `baba` and `is` rules. But to do that, I need to navigate around obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the `key` is needed to access a different part of the level, but without seeing the full layout, it's hard to say. However, given the active rule is still ""baba is you"" and the win condition is a separate object, the likely solution is to redefine the win condition to be baba himself.

Therefore, the best action would be to move towards the `win` rule and start pushing it towards the `baba` and `is` rules to create ""baba is win."" The immediate next step is to move right to approach the `win` rule located at 1 step right and 4 up.

Let's try to figure this out. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, Baba becomes that object. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the left and up, a door, several walls, and the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Hmm, the ""win"" rule is positioned relatively far from where Baba is currently. Let me see where Baba is located. The observation mentions ""rule `baba`"" at 9 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba's position is somewhere in that area.

The key is at 8 steps left and 4 steps up. To get to the key, I might need to move left and up. But the path is blocked by walls, right? Let's check the walls. There's a wall at 4 steps left and 4 steps up, which is where the key is currently placed. Wait, no, the key is at 8 steps left and 4 steps up. Maybe the walls are in between. Also, there's a ""door"" at 7 steps left and 4 steps up. Doors can sometimes be passed through unless there's a ""stop"" rule, but the ""door"" rule is present, so maybe moving into the door is allowed unless it's defined as stop. Let me check if ""door"" has any immovable properties. The active rules don't mention ""door is stop,"" so maybe I can go through the door.

But the immediate goal is probably to get the key. However, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up from the ""win"" rule's position. Wait, the ""win"" rule is located at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So if I can reach that ""win"" rule, since Baba is you, then touching it would make Baba win. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't necessary. Let me think. If I can move towards the ""win"" rule directly. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up from its current position. Wait, the observation shows ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" in the previous steps, but now it's adjusted. Let me check the latest observation:

In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. So from Baba's position at 9 steps left and 2 steps down, moving right and up would get closer. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 4 steps up. How to navigate around that?

Wait, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule to change the definition of ""win."" For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make Baba the win condition. But how? The existing rules are ""baba is you,"" and other rules like ""key is you"" might not be present. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you."" The rest are rules on the map that can be moved.

So the objects on the map include several ""rule `is`"" blocks. If I can move the ""is"" rule to combine it with another rule, like ""win is you"" or ""baba is win,"" that could change the game. For instance, if I move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""rule `win`"" and ""rule `you`,"" then it would create a new rule ""win is you,"" making the win object interactable as you.

Looking at the map, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 7 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""rule `is`"" is at 8 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win,"" then combining them would create a new rule. But where is the ""win"" rule located? In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up from its current position. Wait, the ""win"" rule's position is listed as 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. But relative to where? Maybe relative to the previous position. This is a bit confusing with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the ""win"" rule. From Baba's position at 9 left, 2 down, moving right would decrease the left steps. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 4 up. So moving right once and up four times. But there's a wall at 4 left and 4 up. Wait, the walls are at 5 steps left and 6 steps left in previous observations, but now they're at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, etc. It's a bit messy. Let me try to visualize.

Baba is at 9 left, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is 1 right and 4 up from somewhere. Maybe the ""win"" rule is at position (9-1, 2+4) = 8 left, 6 up? Not sure. Alternatively, the coordinates might be relative to the map's grid. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, since Baba is you, maybe I can push objects. For example, if there's a ""key"" that I can move to reach a different part of the map. But the key is at 8 left, 4 up. To get there, I need to move left and up. But there's a wall at 4 left and 4 up. Wait, the wall at 4 left and 4 up is blocking the path. Maybe I can move the wall by redefining its property. If I can make ""wall is stop,"" but that's already there. Or maybe move the ""stop"" rule to another place.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 4 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall might become passable. But how? To move a rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but only if I'm not stopped. Since Baba is you, and there's no rule saying ""baba is stop,"" I can move.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 8 left and 2 down. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule and the ""wall"" rule, I could create a new rule that removes the stop property from the wall. For example, moving ""is"" to connect ""wall"" and ""no stop,"" but I don't see a ""no stop"" rule. Alternatively, create ""wall is not stop"" by moving ""is"" between ""wall"" and ""stop"" and then deleting ""stop"" from the wall's properties. But this requires manipulating the existing rules.

Another approach: Since the goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, and the active rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location by dragging it with me. If I can move the ""win"" rule towards Baba's position, then touching it would make Baba win. The ""win"" rule is currently 1 step right and 4 up. If I move right and up towards it, perhaps I can grab the ""win"" rule and bring it to Baba.

But how to move the ""win"" rule. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 4 up from its current position. Wait, in the current observation, the ""win"" rule's position is listed as ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 4 step up."" So relative to where? Maybe relative to the previous position. This is a bit unclear. Alternatively, the coordinates might be in absolute terms, but the way they're described is relative movements.

This is getting a bit too confusing. Let me try to summarize:

- Baba is you, so moving Baba moves whatever he's touching.
- The goal is likely to reach the ""win"" object.
- The ""win"" rule is located at a position that's 1 right and 4 up from somewhere.
- There are several ""rule `is`"" blocks on the map that can be moved to create new rules.
- The key is present but blocked by walls.
- The door might be passable.

Perhaps the solution is to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule so that it's between ""baba"" and ""win,"" then the new rule would be ""baba is win,"" and since Baba is you, touching the win object would automatically make you win.

Looking at the current positions:

- ""rule `baba`"" is at 9 left, 2 down.
- ""rule `win`"" is at 1 right and 4 up from its current position. Wait, in the current observation, the ""win"" rule is listed as ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 4 step up."" So if the ""win"" rule is at position (X, Y), then it's 1 step right and 4 up from there. This is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, the ""win"" rule's coordinates are 1 right and 4 up relative to Baba's position. If Baba is at 9 left, 2 down, then the ""win"" rule would be at 8 left (9-1) and 6 up (2+4), making it 8 left, 6 up. But I'm not sure.

Assuming the ""win"" rule is at 8 left, 6 up, and Baba is at 9 left, 2 down, the distance is quite far. To reach it, I need to move left and up. But there are walls in the way. However, if I can redefine the rules to make walls passable, that could help.

Alternatively, focus on creating a rule that makes Baba the win condition. The ""rule `is`"" is at 8 left and 2 down. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule, then combining them would create ""baba is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from 8 left, 2 down to be adjacent to both ""baba"" (9 left, 2 down) and ""win"" (8 left, 6 up). That seems challenging because the ""win"" rule is far up.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule up towards the ""win"" rule. Let's see:

Baba is at 9 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 8 left, 2 down. So moving right once (to 8 left, 2 down) would get to the ""is"" rule. Then, move up to bring it towards the ""win"" rule. Each move would take the ""is"" rule closer. For example:

1. Move right to get to the ""is"" rule at 8 left, 2 down.
2. Move up multiple times to reach the ""win"" rule's area.
3. Position the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win.""

But this requires navigating through possibly blocked areas. The walls are at 4 left and 4 up, which might be on the way. If I can move around them by redefining rules, that could work.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something, but without knowing the level's layout, it's hard to say.

Another angle: The ""door"" is at 7 left, 4 up. If I can move behind the door and push it, but doors are usually passageable unless stopped. Since there's a ""stop"" rule at 7 left, 4 up, which is the door's position, that might mean the door is stoppable. But if I can remove the ""stop"" property from the door, then I can pass through.

To do that, I could move the ""stop"" rule away from the door. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 4 up (same as the door's position). If I can move the ""stop"" rule to another location, then the door wouldn't be stop anymore. For example, move the ""stop"" rule down or right.

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. Since Baba is you, and there's no rule preventing movement, I can try to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 4 up. If I move left from Baba's position (9 left, 2 down), I can get to 8 left, 2 down (the ""is"" rule), then up to 8 left, 3 down, etc., but this might not reach the ""stop"" rule quickly.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of the simplest solution. Since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and the goal is usually to reach ""win,"" maybe I can move the ""win"" rule towards Baba by carrying it. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule and move in the desired direction.

In the current observation, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 up from its current position. Assuming that's relative to where it was before, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ""win"" rule is positioned such that from Baba's current position (9 left, 2 down), moving right and up would reach it. Let's try:

- Move right once to get closer.
- Then move up four times to reach the ""win"" rule's position.

But there's a wall at 4 left and 4 up. If I can move that wall by redefining its property, perhaps making it not a stop, then I can pass through.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that makes the wall passable. For example, create ""wall is not stop"" by moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""not stop,"" but there's no ""not stop"" rule on the map.

Alternatively, create ""you is win"" by moving ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win."" The ""you"" rule is at 7 left, 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 4 up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 left, 2 down to be between ""you"" (7 left, 2 down) and ""win"" (assuming position based on previous steps), then creating ""you is win"" would make the win condition apply to you.

But this requires precise movement. Let me outline the steps:

1. Move from Baba's position (9 left, 2 down) to the ""is"" rule at 8 left, 2 down. This would involve moving left once.
2. Then move up to reach the area of the ""you"" rule and ""win"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 7 left, 2 steps down, which is one left and two down from Baba's original position. Wait, no, the ""you"" rule is at 7 left and 2 steps down from where? This is getting confusing with the coordinate descriptions.

Alternatively, perhaps the best action is to move towards the ""win"" rule in the hope that by reaching it, the game ends. Given the previous attempts where moving right and up didn't work, maybe a different approach is needed.

Another idea: Since the ""key"" is present, maybe obtaining the key and using it to unlock the door. But without knowing the level's specifics, it's hard to say. If the door is a ""stop"" object, having the key might allow passing through it if there's a rule like ""key is push"" or something, but there's no such rule active.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are on the map as objects. So if I can move the ""key"" to a position where it can be used, like next to the door, but I don't see a rule that allows keys to open doors in this setup.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the key capable of opening doors. For example, ""key is door"" by moving ""is"" between them. But the door is at 7 left, 4 up, and the key is at 8 left, 4 up. So if I can move the ""is"" rule from 8 left, 2 down to between the key and the door, that could create ""key is door,"" making the key act as a door. But then, since Baba is you, touching the key (which is now a door) would let you pass through?

This is quite complex. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe the simplest valid action is to keep moving right or up towards the ""win"" rule, assuming that eventually I'll reach it. Alternatively, try to grab the ""win"" rule by moving towards it.

Looking at the latest observation, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 steps up. From Baba's position at 9 left, 2 down, moving right once would bring him to 8 left, 2 down. Then moving up four times would get to 8 left, 6 down (assuming up increases the coordinate). But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, the correct action is to move up to reach the ""win"" rule. Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the next step is to move up again.

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. So the goal is usually to get Baba to the Win object, but here the rules might be different. Let's see the current active rules: ""baba is you"". That means whatever I move, it's Baba, right? So I can move Baba around by moving the text blocks that define the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, a door, walls, and some rules like 'win' and 'is'. The 'win' object is probably where I need to get to. But there's a door in the way. Wait, the door is at 7 left, 3 step up. The key is at 8 left, 3 step up. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock the door? But how do I do that? Since I'm Baba, maybe I can push things if they're not STOP. Let me check for STOP properties. There's a rule `stop` at 7 left, 2 step up. So the wall there is STOP. That means I can't move past it.

The key is right next to the door, but the door is blocking the path. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it to change a rule. Let me see the available text blocks. There's a 'rule `is`' at 3 step up. If I can move that 'is' block, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I make ""key is win"", then grabbing the key would make it a win condition. Or maybe ""door is key"" to unlock it. Alternatively, I could change ""baba is you"" to something else, like ""baba is win"" so that touching the Win object makes me win.

Wait, but I need to move the 'is' text blocks to form new rules. Let me look at the positions. The 'is' rule is at 3 step up. If I move it down to where the door is, maybe I can write ""door is key"". Then, stepping on the door would count as having the key. Or maybe move the 'is' to the key's location and make ""key is win"". That way, picking up the key would make it the win condition.

Alternatively, since Baba is You, I can move any movable object that isn't STOP. The walls labeled 'wall' are STOP, but the 'door' and 'key' might be movable. Let me check. The rule `door` is at 2 step up. So the door's behavior is defined by that rule. If I can move the 'door' text block, maybe I can change its property. For example, moving it to say ""door is you"", but I'm already Baba. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the 'key' is at 8 left, 3 step up. If I move towards it, but there's a wall at 4 left, 3 step up. That's a STOP wall, so I can't go through it. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to remove the STOP property from that wall. There's a rule `stop` at 7 left, 2 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then the wall at 4 left, 3 step up might become passable. But how?

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that makes the wall not a STOP. For example, move the 'is' rule next to the wall and write ""wall is you"", but I'm already Baba. Wait, ""baba is you"" means I can be anything. If I make ""wall is you"", then stepping on the wall would make me win. But I need to move the 'is' block to do that.

Let me track the positions again. The 'is' block is at 3 step up. If I move it to the wall at 4 left, 3 step up, and write ""wall is you"", then touching that wall would make me win. But how do I get there? The path is blocked by the STOP wall at 7 left, 2 step up. Maybe I can move the 'stop' rule away first. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left, 2 step up. If I can move that to somewhere else, then the wall at 4 left, 3 step up would no longer be STOP. But to move the 'stop' rule, I need to be able to pull or push it, which requires it not to be STOP. Since the wall it's on is a STOP, maybe I can't move it. This is tricky.

Another approach: Since the key is near the door, maybe I can pick up the key first. The key is at 8 left, 3 step up. If I move right from my current position, but there's a wall at 4 left. Wait, where is Baba located? The observation doesn't explicitly say where Baba is, but the rules mention ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 1 step down"". So Baba is at 9 left, 1 down. The 'you' rule is at 8 left, 1 down, which probably follows Baba. So to move right, from 9 left, moving right would take me to 8 left. Let's see if that's possible.

If I move right once, I'd be at 8 left. Is there an object there? There's a key at 8 left, 3 step up. But moving horizontally, from 9 left to 8 left, maybe that's possible. But I need to see if the path is clear. Between 9 left and 8 left, are there any STOP walls? The wall at 4 left is a STOP, but that's not in the way. So moving right from 9 left to 8 left should be possible. Once there, I can pick up the key. But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push objects by moving into them from the side, but you have to be able to move past them if they're not STOP.

Wait, the key is a separate object. If I move into the same position as the key, does that count as picking it up? Or do I need to push it? Since the key is not a STOP object, I can move it by pushing. So if I move right into the key's position, I can push it. But I need to be adjacent to it. Let me check the positions again. The key is at 8 left, 3 step up. If I'm at 9 left, 1 down (Baba's position), moving right to 8 left would be horizontally adjacent. Then, if I move up to 8 left, 3 step up, that's where the key is. But how do I get there without being blocked?

Wait, moving from 9 left, 1 down to 8 left, 1 down is possible (right action). Then, from there, moving up to 8 left, 3 step up would require moving up two steps. But are there any walls in between? The wall at 4 left is far left, so not in the way. The walls at 5 left, various positions, but 8 left is on the right side. So moving up from 8 left, 1 down to 8 left, 3 step up should be possible. Once there, I can push the key. But the key is already at 8 left, 3 step up. Maybe I need to move it further. If I push the key to the right, to 7 left, 3 step up, which is where the door is. Then, if I can change the door's property to be a key, maybe I can open it.

But to push the key, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction. So from 8 left, 1 down, move up to 8 left, 2 down, then up to 8 left, 3 up (where the key is). Then, move right while pushing the key to 7 left, 3 up. That way, the key is next to the door. Then, using the 'is' rule at 3 step up, I can create a new rule like ""door is key"" by moving the 'is' block next to the door and the key. But how to do that?

Alternatively, once the key is next to the door, I can move the 'is' block from its current position (3 step up) to the door's location (7 left, 3 step up) and write ""door is key"". Then, stepping on the door would count as having the key, allowing me to pass through. But I need to move the 'is' block there. The 'is' block is currently at 3 step up. To move it down to 7 left, 3 step up, I need to move it left and down. But can I do that?

Baba is at 9 left, 1 down. To move the 'is' block at 3 step up, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The 'is' block's position is a bit unclear. Wait, in the observation, the 'is' rule is listed with coordinates. For example, ""rule `is` 3 step up"" probably means it's 3 steps up from Baba's position. Wait, no—the coordinates are relative. The key is 9 step to the left and 6 step up from some origin point. But I'm not sure. The exact positioning might be tricky without a visual, but I have to work with the relative positions given.

Assuming that the 'is' rule at 3 step up is above the key and door area, I might need to navigate there. Let's say I first move right to get closer to the key. From Baba's position at 9 left, 1 down, moving right once gets me to 8 left, 1 down. Then moving up to 8 left, 3 up (where the key is). Then, pushing the key right to 7 left, 3 up. Now, the key is next to the door. Then, moving the 'is' block from 3 step up (which is somewhere above) down to the door's location. If I can move the 'is' block there, I can create the ""door is key"" rule.

To move the 'is' block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The 'is' block is at 3 step up from where? Maybe from the origin point, but the observation lists all objects with their positions relative to Baba? Or is it a grid-based system? This is a bit confusing without a visual, but let's assume that the 'is' block is above the key and door area. So moving from Baba's position, I need to move up to reach it.

Alternatively, after getting the key next to the door, I can use the 'is' block to create a new rule. For example, if I make ""key is win"", then picking up the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block to the key's location and write ""key is win"". But the key is already at 7 left, 3 up after being pushed. So moving the 'is' block there and rearranging the text to form ""key is win"".

But how to physically move the 'is' block? Let's say I'm at 8 left, 3 up (with the key), then move left to where the 'is' block is. If the 'is' block is at 3 step up from Baba's original position (9 left, 1 down), that would be 9 left, 1 down + 3 up = 9 left, 4 up. So to get there, I need to move up three times from Baba's starting position. But there might be walls in the way. The wall at 4 left, 5 step up is a STOP, but that's on the left side, so moving up from 9 left should be clear.

Once I reach the 'is' block at 9 left, 4 up, I can move it left or right. If I move it to the key's location at 7 left, 3 up, that would allow me to create the ""key is win"" rule. Then, stepping on the key would make it the win condition. Alternatively, moving the 'is' block to the door's location to make ""door is key"".

But this requires navigating around the map and moving multiple text blocks. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move right from Baba's starting position (9 left, 1 down) to 8 left, 1 down.
2. Move up to 8 left, 3 up (where the key is).
3. Push the key right to 7 left, 3 up (next to the door).
4. Move the 'is' block from its current position (probably above) down to the door's location.
5. Change the 'is' rule to ""door is key"", allowing the door to be passed.
6. Now, go through the door to the Win object.

Alternatively, step 5 could be changing the key to win. Let's say after step 3, the key is at 7 left, 3 up. Move the 'is' block there and create ""key is win"". Then, picking up the key (by stepping on it) would make me win.

But how to execute these moves? Each action is a single step (up, down, left, right, or idle). So I need to plan a sequence of moves to position myself and the text blocks correctly.

Let me try to map out the movement:

Current position: 9 left, 1 down (Baba).

First, move right to 8 left, 1 down.

Then, move up to 8 left, 2 down.

Then, move up again to 8 left, 3 up (key's position).

Now, push the key right to 7 left, 3 up by moving right while adjacent.

Now, the key is at 7 left, 3 up (door's position).

Next, need to get the 'is' block to this area. The 'is' block is at 3 step up from Baba's original position, which would be 9 left, 1 down + 3 up = 9 left, 4 up.

So from current position (8 left, 3 up), move left to 9 left, 3 up.

Then move up to 9 left, 4 up (where the 'is' block is).

Now, move the 'is' block left to 8 left, 4 up.

Then move down to 8 left, 3 up (near the key and door).

Now, with the 'is' block at 8 left, 3 up, create the rule ""key is win"" by arranging the blocks. But in the game, you have to place the text blocks adjacent to each other to form a rule. So moving the 'key' text block next to the 'is' block and the 'win' block.

But the 'win' block is at 1 step to the right and 5 step up from the original position. Wait, the 'win' rule is listed as ""rule `win` 6 step up"" in the initial observations, but after some movements, its position might have changed. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, once the 'is' block is next to the key and the 'win' block, form the rule ""key is win"". Then, stepping on the key would make it the win condition.

But I need to ensure that the 'win' block is in the correct position. Let me check the current observation. The 'win' object is at 6 step up. If the 'win' block is a text rule, its position might be separate. This is getting too vague without seeing the actual grid.

Another approach: Since Baba is You, maybe I can just walk into the Win object. But it's currently at a position I can't reach because of the door and walls. So I need to remove the door's barrier or change the Win condition.

Wait, the door is at 7 left, 3 step up. If I can change the door's property to 'stop' being a problem, or make the door something else. For example, if I make ""door is key"", then stepping on the door would give me the key, which I can then use to win.

But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to the door and the key. Let's see. After moving the key to 7 left, 3 up (next to the door), then move the 'is' block there and write ""door is key"".

So the steps would be:

1. Move right to 8 left, 1 down.
2. Up to 8 left, 3 up.
3. Push key right to 7 left, 3 up.
4. Go to the 'is' block at 9 left, 4 up.
5. Move left to 8 left, 4 up.
6. Down to 8 left, 3 up.
7. Align the 'is' block between door and key to make ""door is key"".
8. Now, stepping on the door gives key, which might allow passage or make me win.

Alternatively, once the door is a key, I can pick it up and use it to interact with the Win object.

But I'm not sure. Another possibility is changing the Win condition to Baba, so that just being Baba near the Win object makes me win. For example, ""baba is win"". But the original rule is ""baba is you"", so I can change that by moving the 'is' block.

Wait, the original rule is ""baba is you"". If I can move the 'you' part, maybe. The 'you' rule is at 8 left, 1 step down. So if I can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", then touching the Win object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'you' block to 'win'.

So the steps would be:

1. Find the 'you' block, which is at 8 left, 1 step down.
2. Move it next to 'baba' and 'win' to form ""baba is win"".

But the 'win' object is at 6 step up. So how to get there?

This is getting quite complex. Maybe a simpler solution: since I'm Baba, and I can move any non-STOP object, perhaps I can move the 'win' rule to be under Baba. For example, if there's a rule ""baba is win"", then just standing near the Win object would make me win. To do that, I need to reposition the 'win' text block next to 'baba'.

The 'win' rule is currently at 6 step up. If I can move it down to where Baba is, then create the rule ""baba is win"". Let's see.

From Baba's position at 9 left, 1 down, move up to reach the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 6 step up. So moving up six times from 1 down would get me to","

Let's see. The game is Baba Is You, and the goal is usually to make Baba the ""WIN"" object. But the rules can be changed by moving text blocks. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", so I'm controlled by Baba.

Looking at the objects, there's a key, a door, and walls. The key is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. The wall is at 4 left, 3 up. Then there are various ""rule"" blocks scattered around. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So maybe the exit is there?

But how do I get there? The door is blocking the path. To open the door, maybe I need to change the door's property. Or perhaps the door isn't a stop if I can redefine it. Let me check the rules. There's a ""door is door"" rule at 2 steps up. So the door's identity is fixed. But if I can move that rule or create a new one that makes door not a stop, maybe I can pass through.

Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to unlock the door. The key is to the left and up, but I'm currently where the ""baba is you"" rule is, which is at 9 left, 3 steps down. So I need to move towards the key first to pick it up. Wait, but how do I move? The actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to navigate to the key.

Let me map out the positions. The key is 8 left, 3 up from my current position (baba is at 9 left, 3 down). So to get to the key, I need to move left once to get to 8 left, and then up three steps. But the path might be blocked by walls or stops. Let's see.

From the current position (baba at 9 left, 3 down), moving left once takes me to 8 left, 3 down. Then up to 8 left, 2 down. Then up again to 8 left, 1 down. Then up to 8 left, 0 (assuming up from 1 down is 0). Wait, but the key is at 8 left, 3 up. So maybe the coordinates are a bit different. Maybe the directions are relative. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the key is directly to the left and up from Baba's position. The observation says the key is 8 steps left and 3 up from Baba. So if I move left once, that would be 7 left, same y. Then up three times to reach 3 up. But along the way, are there any walls or stops that block the path?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up. But that's to the right of the key's position. So moving left from Baba's position (9 left) to 8 left, then up three steps should be clear as long as there are no stop properties in between. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", I can move unless there's a ""stop"" rule. Let me check for stops.

There's a ""stop"" rule at 7 left, 2 step up. So if I move up from 8 left, 3 down to 8 left, 2 down (which is equivalent to 8 left, 1 up), there's a stop at 7 left, 2 up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit different. Maybe the stop is in a different position relative to me.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to visualize the grid. Baba is at 9 left, 3 down. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. So the direction from Baba to the key is left and up. But moving left once gets to 8 left, same y. Then moving up three times would reach the key. However, between 8 left and the key, is there any stop?

The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 2 step up. So if I'm at 8 left, moving left to 7 left would hit that stop, but I need to go to 8 left first. Then moving up. Wait, maybe the stop is not on the path. Alternatively, maybe the stop is a wall that's defined as stop, so I can't move into it.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on changing the door's rule. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. The rule for door is ""door is door"" at 2 step up. If I can move that rule or create a new rule that says ""door is not stop"", then the door wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" text block or the ""is"" text block.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""door"" rule at 2 step up. Also, there's an ""is"" rule at 1 step up. So if I can push the ""door"" rule and the ""is"" rule together to form ""door is something else"", like ""door is key"" or ""door is win"". But how do I move the text blocks? The action would be to move a text block that's not defined as stop. The ""is"" rules and ""baba"" might be movable.

Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so I can move Baba. But to move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it, right? So maybe I need to move towards the ""door"" rule and the ""is"" rule, combine them to change the door's property.

For example, if I can create a rule ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" text block next to the ""is"" text block and the ""win"" text block.

Alternatively, the current ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 step up from Baba. So if I can get to that ""win"" rule and combine it with ""door"" and ""is"", maybe I can change the door's rule.

But first, I need to navigate past the door. If the door is a stop, I can't pass through. So perhaps the solution is to reassign the door's property. Let me check the existing rules. There's ""wall is stop"", ""door is door"", ""key is key"", etc. So to make the door not a stop, I need to either remove the ""stop"" rule from wall or change the door's rule.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""door is you"", but then if door is you, touching it would make you door, which might not help. Or ""door is win"", so touching door would make you win.

But how to create that rule? I need to have the text blocks ""door"", ""is"", and ""win"" arranged adjacent to each other and move them together.

Alternatively, since the key is nearby, maybe picking up the key allows me to unlock something, but I don't see a lock object.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move through walls unless they are defined as stop. The current rules have ""wall is stop"", so walls are stops. But the door is a stop as well unless redefined.

So the door is a stop, meaning I can't push past it. Therefore, I need to either remove the door's stop property or find another way around.

Another idea: if I can change the ""win"" rule to be Baba, then touching anything would make me win. But the current ""win"" rule is separate.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". All other rules are text blocks on the map that can be moved. So to create a new rule, I need to push existing text blocks together.

For example, there's a ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move the ""door"" text block next to ""is"" and ""win"", then I can create ""door is win"", making the door a win condition.

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the ""door"" rule (at 7 left, 3 up) and the ""is"" rule (at 1 step up?), combine them with ""win"".

But first, I need to navigate to that area. Let's see the current position of Baba: 9 left, 3 steps down. The ""door"" rule is at 7 left, 3 up. So from Baba's position, moving left twice (to 7 left) and up three times (to 3 up) would reach the door's rule. But along the way, are there any obstacles?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up, which is to the right of the door. But moving left from Baba's position, the path to 7 left and 3 up should be clear, except for the door itself which is a stop. So I can't move into the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule and the ""door"" rule together. Let's see where the ""is"" rules are. There's an ""is"" at 3 step up, another at 1 step up, and another at 6 left and 1 step up.

To create ""door is win"", I need to have ""door"", ""is"", and ""win"" adjacent. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from Baba. So from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down), moving right once gets to 8 left, 3 down. Then up three times to reach 8 left, 0 (assuming up three from 3 down brings me to 0). The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from Baba, which would be 10 left, 0 (since 9 left +1 right = 10 left, and 3 down +3 up = 0). So the ""win"" rule is at 10 left, 0.

The ""door"" rule is at 7 left, 3 up (from Baba's position). So the positions are:

- ""door"" rule: 7 left, 3 up
- ""is"" rule: maybe at 3 step up from Baba, which is 9 left, 0 (3 up from 3 down)
- ""win"" rule: 10 left, 0

So to create ""door is win"", I need to move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"". Let's see:

Starting at Baba's position (9 left, 3 down):

1. Move up three times to reach 9 left, 0 (3 up).
2. Move right once to reach 10 left, 0 (win rule's location).
3. Here, there's the ""win"" rule. Now, need to get the ""door"" rule to this area.

But the ""door"" rule is at 7 left, 3 up. To get it to 10 left, 0, I need to move it right 3 times and down 3 times. But can I push the ""door"" rule? It's a text block, so as long as it's not defined as stop. The ""door is door"" rule means that door's identity is fixed, but the text block itself can be moved unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it. Looking at the objects, is there a ""stop"" on the ""door"" rule? The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 2 step up, which is a different position. So the ""door"" rule can be moved.

So steps to move the ""door"" rule to adjacent ""is"" and ""win"":

1. From Baba's position (9 left, 3 down), move left twice to 7 left, 3 down (same as the ""door"" rule's x-coordinate, 7 left). Then move up three times to reach 7 left, 0 (3 up from 3 down).
2. Now, at 7 left, 0, there's the ""door"" rule. Need to move it right to reach the ""win"" rule at 10 left, 0.
3. To move right, push the ""door"" rule right. Each move would require being adjacent and pushing it. So from 7 left, 0, move right to 8 left, 0 (but need to check if there's anything blocking). Looking at objects, at 8 left, 0, there's a wall? The wall is at 4 left, 3 up, which is not in this path. So probably can move right.
4. Continue moving right from 7 left, 0 to 8, 0; 9, 0; 10, 0. At 10 left, 0 is the ""win"" rule. Now, place the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"".

Wait, but there's an ""is"" rule at 3 step up from Baba, which is 9 left, 0. So at 9 left, 0, there's an ""is"" rule. So if I can place the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"", then combining them would create ""door is win"".

So the plan is:

- Move the ""door"" rule to 9 left, 0 (adjacent to the ""is"" rule at 9 left, 0) and the ""win"" rule at 10 left, 0.

But how to position them. Maybe:

1. Move the ""door"" rule from 7 left, 0 to 8 left, 0.
2. Then to 9 left, 0 (next to the ""is"" rule).
3. Then move the ""is"" rule and ""door"" rule together to 10 left, 0 alongside the ""win"" rule.

This way, the three text blocks (""door"", ""is"", ""win"") are adjacent, forming ""door is win"".

Once that rule is created, the door would become a win condition. Then, moving into the door would make me win.

So the steps in actions would be:

- From Baba's initial position (9 left, 3 down):
   - Move left twice to 7 left, 3 down (align with door rule).
   - Move up three times to 7 left, 0.
   - Move right three times to 10 left, 0 (win rule's position).
   - While moving, ensure that the path isn't blocked by stops or walls.

But need to check if during this movement, any stops are encountered. For example, moving up from 7 left, 3 down to 7 left, 0: are there any stops in between? The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 2 step up, which would be 7 left, 1 down (if down is negative). Wait, the coordinates might be relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to focus on relative movements.

Alternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to move towards the ""win"" rule and the ""door"" rule, rearrange the text blocks to create ""door is win"".

But given the previous failed attempts, maybe the immediate action should be to move towards the ""win"" rule to see if touching it does something. But the active rule is ""baba is you"", and ""win"" is a separate object. Unless there's a rule that makes touching win a condition, which there isn't currently.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the ""key"" first, but I don't see a lock.

Another thought: since the key is nearby, maybe picking up the key allows me to unlock the door. But there's no lock object in the map. The key is just a key; unless there's a rule that says ""key unlocks door"", but there isn't. So probably not.

Back to the original plan: rearrange the text blocks to make ""door is win"". To do that, need to move the ""door"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"".

Given the current positions:

- ""door"" rule: 7 left, 3 up (from Baba's position)
- ""is"" rules: multiple, including at 3 step up (9 left, 0)
- ""win"" rule: 1 step right and 3 up from Baba (10 left, 0)

So from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down):

1. Move left to 8 left, 3 down.
2. Move up to 8 left, 2 down (which is 8 left, 1 up).
3. Move up again to 8 left, 1 up.
4. Move up to 8 left, 0 (3 up from original position).
5. Now, move right to 9 left, 0 (where the ""is"" rule is).
6. Push the ""is"" rule to the right to 10 left, 0 (next to ""win"").
7. Meanwhile, move the ""door"" rule from 7 left, 3 up to 8 left, 3 up, then to 9 left, 3 up, and so on until it's adjacent to ""is"" and ""win"".

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach is to move directly towards the ""win"" rule and see if repositioning the text blocks there can create the desired rule.

Alternatively, since the last action was ""up"" and the observation shows that Baba moved up, perhaps the next step is to move right to get closer to the ""win"" rule.

Looking at the last observation after moving up, Baba is now at 8 step to the left and 5 step up. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 5 step up. So from there, moving right once would place Baba next to the ""win"" rule.

So the action could be ""right"" to get next to the ""win"" rule, then try to move the ""is"" and ""door"" rules adjacent to it.

But I need to output a single action. Given the previous pattern, the assistant kept moving right, up, etc., but the game defaulted to idle when invalid actions were given. Now, in the current observation, Baba is at 8 left, 5 up, and the ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 5 up. So moving right would position Baba next to the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, moving up again to reach the ""win"" rule's position. But let's check the coordinates:

Baba's position: 8 left, 5 up.

""win"" rule: 1 step right and 5 up → 9 left, 5 up.

So moving right once would get to 9 left, 5 up, next to the ""win"" rule.

Then, look for the ""door"" rule and ""is"" rule nearby to rearrange them.

But in the current observation, after moving up, the key is at 8 left, 4 up, door at 7 left, 4 up, etc. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. Maybe moving right to get next to","

Let's see. The goal is to reach the 'win' object, which is usually a door or a specific tile. But in Baba Is You, the rules can be changed, so I need to look at the current active rules.

The active rules here are just ""baba is you."" So, as Baba, I can move around, but I need to find a way to get past the walls and door. The key is probably involved. Let me check the objects on the map.

There's a key positioned 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is at 7 steps left and 3 up. So the key is adjacent to the door. If I can pick up the key, maybe it changes the door's property? But how?

Looking at the other rules, there are several 'is' rules scattered around. For example, rule `win` is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. That might be a tile that's defined as win. Also, there's a rule `key` at 1 step to the right and 1 step down, and `baba` and `you` rules further down.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any object that's not stopped. The walls are defined as 'wall' with some 'stop' rules. So I need to move either the key or the 'is' text blocks to create new rules.

Maybe I can move the 'is' rule that's at 3 steps up to combine it with 'key' or 'win.' For example, if I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. But how to do that?

The key is 8 left, 3 up. The 'is' rule is at 3 step up, but where exactly? Let me parse the objects again:

- rule `is` 3 step up
- rule `win` 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down
- rule `you` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down

So the 'is' at 3 step up is between the 'win' and the wall. If I can move that 'is' rule next to the 'key' rule, maybe I can form a new rule like ""key is win."" But how to reach those positions?

I'm currently at the position of 'baba' which is 9 steps left and 3 steps down. To get to the 'is' rule at 3 step up, I need to move up. Let's see: from my position (9 left, 3 down), moving up would take me to 9 left, 2 down, then 1 down, etc. But the 'is' is at 3 step up, which would be above the current 'win' rule.

Alternatively, maybe moving the 'key' rule closer to the 'win' rule. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 up, so that's 7 left, 3 up. So the key is to the left of the 'win' rule. If I can move the key towards the 'win' and 'is' rules, maybe I can create ""key is win"" by placing them adjacent with an 'is' in between.

But to move the key, I need to be next to it. My current position is 9 left, 3 down. The key is 8 left, 3 up. The distance between me and the key is one step to the left and three steps up. So I need to move left once and up three times. Let's see:

1. Move left to 8 left, 3 down.
2. Then up to 8 left, 2 down.
3. Up again to 8 left, 1 down.
4. Up to 8 left, 3 up (reach the key).

Once there, I can pick up the key. But can I move the key? Since the key's rule is ""key is you"" (since ""baba is you"" and if there's a ""key is you"" rule, but in the current active rules, only ""baba is you"" is active. Wait, no—the active rules are just ""baba is you."" So other rules like ""key is you"" might be present as text blocks but not active unless moved.

Wait, the objects include a rule `key` at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. But active rules are only those that are formed by the text blocks correctly. Since the active rules listed are ""baba is you,"" the other rules like ""key is you"" are probably inactive unless moved and combined with an 'is' rule.

So, to activate a new rule, I need to move an 'is' next to a subject and property. For example, if I move the 'is' rule at 3 step up next to the 'key' rule, then ""key is [property]"" would become active.

But the 'key' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from where? Let me check the positions again. The rule `key` is 1 step to the right and 1 step down from where? From the 'baba' position (9 left, 3 down), moving 1 step right and 1 step up would be 8 left, 2 down. But the rule `key` is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down from the 'baba' position? That would be 8 left, 4 down. Wait, the exact positions are a bit confusing because the steps are described relative to some reference point, probably Baba's position.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are absolute on the grid. But regardless, the key is somewhere, and the 'is' rules are scattered. The main idea is to find a way to create a rule that allows me to win.

Since the goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, which might be a door or a specific tile. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. But the door is likely a 'stop' because there's a 'rule stop' at 7 left, 4 up. So the door is a stop, meaning I can't push past it. Unless I change its property.

If I can make the door a 'win' instead of a 'stop,' then standing on it would make me win. To do that, I need to create a rule like ""door is win."" To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to the 'door' and 'win' rules.

The 'door' rule is at 1 step to the left and 4 step up (from the previous observations?), but this might vary. Let me check the current objects:

Current objects include rule `door` at 2 step up. So if I can move an 'is' next to 'door' and 'win,' I can make them equivalent.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push objects if they're not stopped. But doors are 'stop' if the rule says so. So pushing the door might not work.

Another approach: pick up the key and use it to unlock the door. But for that, the key needs to be identified as something that can unlock. If I can create a rule like ""key is unlock"" or ""door needs key,"" but that requires more rules.

Alternatively, make myself a key. If I can create ""baba is key,"" then I can pick up the door or something else. But to do that, I need to move 'is' next to 'baba' and 'key.'

The 'baba' rule is at 9 left and 3 steps down. There's an 'is' rule at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down, maybe? Not sure. Let me look again.

The objects include rule `baba` at 9 step to the left and 1 step down, and rule `is` at 8 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I move the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'key,' I could make ""baba is key,"" then I could push or do something with the key.

But this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- I need to get past the door (which is a stop).
- The key is nearby; maybe using it changes something.
- The 'win' rule is somewhere; I need to reach it.

Possible steps:

1. Move to the key's location (8 left, 3 up) and pick it up.
2. Move to the 'win' location (7 left, 3 up) which is the door.
3. If I can change the door's rule to 'win,' then standing on it would win.

To change the door's rule, need to create ""door is win."" The 'door' rule is at 2 step up, and 'win' is at 1 step right and 3 step up. There's an 'is' rule at 3 step up. Maybe move the 'is' down to be between 'door' and 'win.'

But how to get there? My current position is 9 left, 3 down. Need to move left to 8, then up to reach the key. Then move right to the door area.

Alternatively, find an 'is' rule that's movable and place it between 'door' and 'win.'

Another angle: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move text blocks that are not stopped. The 'is' rules are likely not stopped unless there's a 'stop' rule nearby. Looking at the objects, there's a 'stop' rule at 8 left, 5 step up. So some areas are stopped, but others might not be.

So the plan could be:

- Move to the 'is' rule at 3 step up.
- Move it next to the 'door' rule and the 'win' rule to create ""door is win.""

To do that, from my current position (9 left, 3 down), need to move up to 9 left, 2 down, then 1 down, then 0 down, etc., but the 'is' is at 3 step up, which would be above. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are relative to the grid.

This is getting a bit confusing with the step descriptions. Maybe I should focus on the relative positions.

The key is at 8 left, 3 up. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 up from somewhere. If I can move the 'is' rule that's at 3 step up next to the door and win, then I can create the rule ""door is win.""

The 'is' at 3 step up is probably between the door and the win rule. If I move that 'is' to the left or right to connect door and win, then the rule becomes active.

So, from the key's position (8 left, 3 up), move right to the door's position (7 left, 3 up). But the door is a stop, so I can't move into it. However, I can move text blocks next to it.

The 'is' rule is at 3 step up, which is in the same row as the door and win. If I can move that 'is' to be between 'door' and 'win,' then ""door is win"" becomes active.

To move the 'is' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is 9 left, 3 down. The 'is' is at 3 step up, which is above me. So I need to move up three steps to reach it.

1. Move up from 9 left, 3 down to 9 left, 2 down.
2. Up again to 9 left, 1 down.
3. Up to 9 left, 0 down (which is 3 step up from the original position? Maybe the coordinates are relative.)

Once at the 'is' rule's position (3 step up), I can move it left or right to connect with 'door' and 'win.'

The 'door' is at 7 left, 3 up, and 'win' is at 1 step right and 3 up (which would be 6 left, 3 up). So the 'is' is between them. If I move the 'is' one step left, it would be next to the door, and one step right next to the win. But I need to place 'is' between door and win.

Alternatively, move the 'is' to the left of the door, making ""door is [something]."" But we want ""door is win.""

So maybe move the 'is' to be adjacent to both 'door' and 'win.' Since they are next to each other, placing 'is' in between would create the rule.

But how to get the 'is' there? If the 'is' is currently at 3 step up (say, position 8 left, 3 up), and the door is at 7 left, 3 up, and win is at 6 left, 3 up, then moving the 'is' left to 7 left, 3 up would place it between door and win.

So from the 'is' position (8 left, 3 up), move left to 7 left, 3 up (door's position), but the door is a stop, so can I move the 'is' there? Since 'is' is a text block, and unless there's a 'stop' rule on that tile, I can move it.

Looking at the objects, the tile at door's position (7 left, 3 up) has the door object and possibly a 'stop' rule at 8 left, 5 step up, which is not in the same position. So the tile at 7 left, 3 up is just the door, which is a stop if there's a 'stop' rule affecting it. But the active rules are ""baba is you,"" and other rules may be inactive.

Assuming I can move the 'is' block to the door's tile, then place it between door and win, I can create the rule ""door is win.""

So the steps would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down) up three times to reach the 'is' at 3 step up (8 left, 3 up).
2. Move left to 7 left, 3 up (door's position) to place the 'is' there.
3. Then move right to connect 'is' between door and win, making ""door is win.""
4. Then go to the door (now a win) and stand on it to win.

But how to move the 'is' block? Each move action moves Baba one step in a direction, but to pick up and move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction of the block, I think.

Wait, in Baba Is You, to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction you want to push it. The block will move one step in that direction if the tile behind is empty or can be pushed (not stopped).

So, to move the 'is' block from 8 left, 3 up to 7 left, 3 up (next to the door), I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at 8 left, 3 up (the 'is' position), then moving left would push the 'is' to 7 left, 3 up, provided that tile is not stopped.

Assuming the tile at 7 left, 3 up (door's position) is not stopped (since the 'stop' rule is at 8 left, 5 up), then I can move the 'is' there.

Once the 'is' is at 7 left, 3 up, adjacent to the door, then the rule becomes ""door is [whatever is on the other side]."" But there's the 'win' rule at 1 step right and 3 up, which is 6 left, 3 up. So if I can move the 'is' to be between door and win, then the rule would be ""door is win.""

But the 'is' is now at 7 left, 3 up (next to door). To connect it to 'win' at 6 left, 3 up, I need to move the 'is' left again to 6 left, 3 up. But that tile has the 'win' rule. So placing 'is' between door (7 left) and win (6 left) would make ""door is win.""

Wait, no. The syntax is ""[Subject] IS [Property]."" So if 'door' is on one side of 'is' and 'win' on the other, it becomes ""door is win.""

So to create that rule, 'door' must be adjacent to 'is' and 'win' must be adjacent to 'is' on the other side.

Currently, 'door' is at 7 left, 3 up, 'is' is at 8 left, 3 up, and 'win' is at 6 left, 3 up. So to place 'is' between them, move 'is' left from 8 to 7 to 6. But moving it to 7 would be next to door, and then to 6 would be next to win. So placing 'is' at 7 left, 3 up (between door and win's original positions?) Wait, the 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 up from somewhere. Let me check again.

The 'win' rule is listed as rule `win` 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If the reference point is Baba's position (9 left, 3 down), then 1 step right and 3 up would be 8 left, 0 down, which might not make sense. Alternatively, the positions are absolute on the grid.

This is getting too ambiguous without seeing the actual grid layout. Maybe I need to focus on the available actions and see which one leads me closer.

Given that the previous actions were moving right, up, etc., and the last valid action was 'up' which moved the key down, perhaps the correct path is to keep moving towards the key, then use it to manipulate the rules.

Alternatively, since the key is nearby, maybe pick it up and move it to a position where it can change a rule. For example, if I can place the key next to a 'win' rule and an 'is' rule, making ""key is win.""

The 'key' is at 8 left, 3 up. The 'win' rule is at 1 step right and 3 up, which would be 7 left, 3 up (if the reference is Baba's position). So the key is at 8 left, 3 up, and 'win' is at 7 left, 3 up. The distance between them is one step left. If I can move the key left to 7 left, 3","

72,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the correct action here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" or something that restricts movement. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key, a door, and several walls. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, which is currently at ""1 step to the right and 3 step up.""

First, I need to check if there's a way to reach the door or the key. The key is located at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. Since I'm ""Baba,"" and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can move towards the key. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, the key is 8 steps left, so maybe I need to move left to get to the key? But the wall might block that path. Alternatively, maybe I can move up to get past the wall? Let me check the positions again.

The ""win"" object is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Right now, the ""win"" is positioned at a different location than the door. The door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. So the ""win"" is adjacent to the door. If I can get to the door, maybe I can push it or interact with it somehow. But the door's rule is ""rule `door` 2 step up,"" which probably means ""door is stop"" or another property. Wait, the active rules don't show any other rules except ""baba is you."" Hmm.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" block at various positions. Maybe I can pick up the ""is"" block and change a rule. For example, if I can make ""door is win"" or ""baba is win,"" that could change the goal. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to the door or the win condition and combine them. 

The ""is"" block is located at 3 step up, 1 step to the right and 3 step up (win's position), and other locations. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 step up. If I can move towards the ""is"" block at 3 step up, maybe I can rearrange the rules. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 step up. How do I get past that? Since I'm ""Baba"" and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move through walls? Wait, no. Normally, walls are ""stop,"" but unless there's a rule that overrides it. The current active rules only have ""baba is you,"" so walls might still be stoppable. 

Alternatively, maybe I can pick up the ""key"" first. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 step up. If I move left, but there's a wall at 4 steps left. Wait, the key is further left than the wall. So moving left from my current position (which isn't specified exactly, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the ""baba"" rule block at 9 steps left and 3 steps down?) would require avoiding the walls. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming Baba is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is 9 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""win"" is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from there, which would place it at 8 steps left and 0 steps down (since 9 left minus 1 right is 8 left, and 3 down minus 3 up is 0). But the current observation shows the ""win"" at 1 step to the right and 3 step up, which might be in a different coordinate system. This is a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the step descriptions, I need to navigate using the relative positions.

The key is at 8 steps left and 3 step up from Baba's position. To get there, I might need to move left and up. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 step up. So moving left directly isn't possible. Maybe moving up first to avoid the wall? Let's see. If I move up, I can get to the ""is"" block at 3 step up, then move left towards the key. But the ""is"" block is at 3 step up, and the key is also at 3 step up. So moving up to 3 step up, then left past the wall? The wall is at 4 steps left, so moving left from Baba's position (9 steps left) to 8,7,6... left, passing the wall at 4 steps left? Wait, that doesn't make sense. The wall at 4 steps left is further to the right (since left is negative direction maybe?). This coordinate system is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable. If I can move them to create a new rule, like ""key is win"" or ""baba is win,"" that would change the objective. For example, if I can place ""baba is win"" next to each other, then touching ""baba"" would make me the win condition. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up and 1 step to the right of the win position. So if I can move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create a new rule. But how to move the ""is"" block? Since I'm ""Baba"" and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push other objects, including text blocks, unless they are defined as ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 step up, which might block movement in that area. 

So the plan could be: move towards the ""is"" block at 3 step up, avoid the walls, and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win."" That way, touching Baba would make me the win condition. To do this, I need to navigate to the ""is"" block, which is at 3 step up. From the current position (assuming near the ""baba"" rule block), moving up once would reach the ""is"" block at 3 step up. Then, move right to position the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win."" 

But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 step up. So moving left from the ""is"" block's position (3 step up) would hit that wall. Maybe I need to move in a different direction. Alternatively, use the ""key"" to reach the ""is"" block. If I get the key first, maybe there's a rule that allows using the key to unlock something, but the current active rules don't mention the key except as an object. 

Another angle: The door is at 7 steps left and 3 step up. If I can make the door a ""win"" by creating a rule ""door is win,"" then pushing the door to the win position would work. But to do that, I need to rearrange the ""is"" blocks. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the door or the win block. But doors are usually ""stop,"" unless there's a rule changing their property. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap the possible actions:

1. Move towards the ""is"" block at 3 step up to create a new rule.
2. Try to reach the key and use it somehow.
3. Navigate around the walls to reach the win condition directly.

Given the previous failed actions, maybe the correct approach is to move up to the ""is"" block and then rearrange it. Let's see. If I move up once, I reach the ""is"" block at 3 step up. Then, move right to place it next to ""win"" and ""baba."" 

But how to do that step by step. The current observation shows that after moving up, the key is now at 8 step left and 3 step up, which is one step closer. Wait, in the previous steps, the key's position changed as the player moved. So maybe by moving in certain directions, the key moves. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key needs to be in a specific position to unlock the door. But without active rules involving the key, it's unclear. 

Another possibility: The ""win"" is currently at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If I can move there, but there's a wall at 4 steps left. Wait, the ""win"" is at a position that's 1 step to the right of the ""is"" block at 3 step up. So maybe moving right from the ""is"" block's position would reach the ""win."" 

If I can get the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then ""baba is win"" would be created, making me the win condition. So the steps would be:

1. Move up to reach the ""is"" block at 3 step up.
2. Move right to position the ""is"" block between ""baba"" (which is at 9 step left and 3 steps down) and ""win"" (1 step to the right of the ""is"" block).
3. Then, the rule ""baba is win"" would be active, allowing me to touch myself to win.

But navigating around the walls is tricky. The wall at 4 steps left and 3 step up is in the way. From the ""is"" block's position (3 step up), moving left would hit that wall. So maybe need to move in a different direction. 

Alternatively, use the ""key"" to reach the ""is"" block. If I move left towards the key, but there's a wall at 4 steps left. So perhaps moving down first to avoid the wall? Let's see. If I'm at Baba's position (9 step left, 3 steps down), moving down would take me to 9 step left, 4 steps down. But I'm not sure if that helps. 

This is quite challenging without a visual representation. The key seems important, but without a rule that uses it, it might be a red herring. The main goal is to create a rule that makes ""baba"" the ""win"" condition. The most straightforward way is to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" 

Given the previous attempts and the fact that the last valid action was ""up"" leading to the ""is"" block, maybe the next step is to move right from there to place the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win."" 

So the chosen action would be ""right.""

The goal is to reach the ""WIN"" object in Baba Is You. The active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move Baba and any objects that are linked through other rules.

Looking at the current observation, the key, door, and walls are positioned in specific ways. The ""win"" object is located 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which might block the path. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 7 steps left and 2 steps up, so anything labeled as stop can't be moved. 

The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe it opens the door, but the door is right next to the key. However, the door is currently under a ""door"" rule, so unless that rule is changed, I can't move it. 

Baba's position is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down, and ""you"" is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to move those rules to change properties. 

Wait, the active rules are ""baba is you"", so I can move Baba and any text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable unless they're under a stop rule. Let's see: the ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up, so that's not affecting the ""is"" rules here. 

To get to the win condition, I need to either navigate around the walls or change the rules. For example, if I can make ""door IS WIN"", then standing on the door would make me win. Alternatively, making ""baba IS WIN"" would make me win immediately. But how to do that?

First, I need to locate the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" and ""baba"", I could create ""baba IS WIN"". Let's check the positions:

The ""is"" rule at 3 steps up is 1 step to the left of the ""win"" rule. If I move the ""is"" rule one step to the right, it would be next to ""win"". Then, if I can move that ""is"" rule to be next to ""baba"", I could make ""baba IS WIN"". 

But how to move the ""is"" rule? The ""is"" rule is at 3 step up. To move it right, I need to move right from there. The current position of Baba is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. Let's calculate the positions relative to each other. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule using other movable objects. Since ""baba is you"", I can move the ""is"" rule by stepping into it and moving. So, from Baba's position at 9 left, 3 down, moving up to the ""is"" rule at 8 left, 3 down (since the ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up from Baba's position? Wait, the observation says rule `is` is 8 step to the left and 3 steps down from Baba's position. Wait, no: the observation says ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down"". So Baba is at 9 left, 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down. So that would be one step to the right of Baba. 

So if I move right from Baba's position, I can reach the ""is"" rule. Then, moving that ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba IS WIN"". 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move right from Baba's current position (9 left, 3 down) to reach the ""is"" rule at 8 left, 3 down.
2. Once I have the ""is"" rule, move it to the left to be next to ""baba"" (which is at 9 left, 3 down). So moving the ""is"" rule left once would place it at 9 left, 3 down, adjacent to ""baba"".
3. Then, move the ""is"" rule up to be next to ""win"" which is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the current position. Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from where? From the ""is"" rule's position after step 2, which is at 9 left, 3 down. Moving up 3 steps would get to 3 step up, and 1 step right would be 10 left. But the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up from the original position. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.

Alternatively, after moving the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"", I can then move it up to be next to ""win"". The ""win"" is currently at 1 step right and 3 step up from the original ""is"" rule position. So if the ""is"" rule is at 9 left, 3 down (next to Baba), moving it up 3 steps would reach 3 step up, and then 1 step right to 10 left. That's where the ""win"" rule is located. So placing the ""is"" rule there would create ""baba IS WIN"", making Baba the win condition. 

So the actions needed would be:

- Move right to get the ""is"" rule.
- Move left to place it next to Baba.
- Move up to place it next to Win.
- Then, by standing on the ""baba IS WIN"" rule, Baba would be win, allowing to touch the Win object without needing to open the door.

But how to execute these moves step by step. Let's see the current positions:

Baba: 9 left, 3 down.

Rule `is`: 8 left, 3 down (1 step right from Baba).

Rule `win`: 1 right, 3 up from where? If the ""win"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the current ""is"" rule position after moving it next to Baba, then yes.

So moving right once to get the ""is"" rule, then left to be next to Baba, then up three times and right once to reach the ""win"" position.

But in the current observation, after moving right once, the ""is"" rule is at 8 left, 3 down. Then moving left from there would place it at 9 left, 3 down, adjacent to Baba. Then moving up three steps would get to 3 step up, and right one step to 10 left, which is where the ""win"" rule is.

But in the current map, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the original ""is"" rule position (which was at 3 step up). So original ""is"" rule is at 3 step up. ""win"" is 1 right and 3 up from there, so 3 up + 3 up = 6 up, and 1 right. So ""win"" is at 1 right, 6 up.

Wait, the observation says: ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"". The reference point for the ""win"" rule's position isn't clear. It might be relative to Baba's position. The observation lists all objects relative to Baba's position. So ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" means from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down), the ""win"" is 1 step right (so 8 left) and 3 steps up (so 0 down, 3 up). So the ""win"" is at 8 left, 0 down (or 8 left, 3 up).

But the ""is"" rule that we want to move is at 8 left, 3 down (1 step right and 3 steps down from Baba). So if we move that ""is"" rule to the left (to 9 left, 3 down) next to Baba, then move up 3 steps to 9 left, 0 down (3 up), and then right 1 step to 8 left, 3 up, which is where the ""win"" is. 

So placing the ""is"" rule there would create ""baba IS WIN"", making Baba the win condition. Then, moving to the ""win"" object would automatically win the level.

Therefore, the sequence of actions should be:

1. Move right once to grab the ""is"" rule.
2. Move left once to place it next to Baba.
3. Move up three times to reach 3 steps up.
4. Move right once to position the ""is"" rule next to ""win"".
5. Then, move to the ""win"" object, which is now winnable.

But considering the current state, the ""win"" rule is already present, but it's separate. By creating ""baba IS WIN"", the rule changes. 

So the immediate next action should be to move right to get the ""is"" rule. Once that's done, the next steps can be planned. 

Looking at the last observation, the user's previous action was ""right"", which might have moved the ""is"" rule to the desired position. But in the current observation, the ""is"" rule is still at 8 left, 3 down, meaning the previous ""right"" action didn't relocate it. Wait, no—the previous actions might have been attempting to move Baba, not the text blocks. Because to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, which would push the text block if it's not stopped.

In the current observation, after the last ""right"" action, the ""is"" rule is still at 8 left, 3 down, which is 1 step right from Baba's position (9 left, 3 down). So moving right again would place Baba next to the ""is"" rule. Once adjacent, moving in the same direction would push the ""is"" rule. 

Wait, the action ""right"" would move Baba to the right, increasing his left coordinate by 1 (since left is a direction). So from 9 left to 8 left. If he moves right while adjacent to the ""is"" rule, he can push it. 

So the correct action here is to move right to get next to the ""is"" rule, then move right again to push the ""is"" rule one step to the right. But in the current observation, after the previous ""right"" action, Baba might already be next to the ""is"" rule. Let me check:

The observation says:

rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down

After moving right, Baba's new position would be 8 step to the left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 8 step to the left and 3 steps down. So they are adjacent. Now, if the agent chooses to move right again, Baba would move to 7 left, 3 down, pushing the ""is"" rule to 7 left, 3 down. 

But the goal is to get the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win"". So pushing the ""is"" rule right once would place it at 7 left, 3 down. Then, move left to get back to Baba, and then move up to position the ""is"" rule correctly. 

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to move right to grab the ""is"" rule, then move left into it, pushing it towards Baba. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to outline the steps again:

1. **Move right** to get next to the ""is"" rule (currently at 8 left, 3 down).
2. **Move right** again to push the ""is"" rule to 7 left, 3 down.
3. Now, the ""is"" rule is at 7 left, 3 down. Move left to return to Baba's position at 8 left, 3 down.
4. Move up once to reach 8 left, 2 down.
5. Move left to 7 left, 2 down (next to the pushed ""is"" rule).
6. Now, the ""is"" rule is at 7 left, 3 down. Need to move it up to be next to ""win"".

Alternatively, after pushing the ""is"" rule to 7 left, 3 down, move up with the ""is"" rule to 7 left, 2 down, then 7 left, 1 down, then 7 left, 0 down (3 up). Then move right to 8 left, 0 down, placing the ""is"" rule next to ""win"" which is at 8 left, 0 down (since ""win"" is 1 right and 3 up from Baba's original position, which is 9 left, 3 down. So 1 right would be 8 left, and 3 up from 3 down is 0 down. So ""win"" is at 8 left, 0 down).

So moving the ""is"" rule from 7 left, 3 down to 8 left, 0 down would require moving up three times and right once. 

But each time you move the ""is"" rule, you have to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, pushing it if possible. 

So the sequence would be:

- After pushing ""is"" to 7 left, 3 down (step 2), move up from there to 7 left, 2 down (step 3).
- Move up again to 7 left, 1 down (step 4).
- Move up again to 7 left, 0 down (step 5).
- Now, move right to 8 left, 0 down, placing the ""is"" rule next to ""win"".

Once the ""is"" rule is next to both ""baba"" and ""win"", the rule becomes ""baba IS WIN"", making Baba the win condition. Then, moving to the ""win"" object (now at 8 left, 0 down) would win the level.

So the immediate next action should be to move up, since the ""is"" rule is currently at 7 left, 3 down, and needs to go up to 7 left, 2 down.

But wait, in the current observation, after the previous actions, where is the ""is"" rule? Let's check the latest observation:

The last observation before the current one shows that the agent tried ""right"" multiple times, but the ""is"" rule hasn't moved. That suggests that maybe the agent hasn't yet moved into position to push the ""is"" rule. 

In the current observation, Baba is at 9 left, 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 8 left, 3 down (1 step right from Baba). So to push the ""is"" rule, Baba needs to move right into it. 

Therefore, the correct action here is to move right once, which would push the ""is"" rule to 7 left, 3 down. This allows the agent to then move the ""is"" rule up towards the ""win"" location.

So the first action should be **right** to push the ""is"" rule.

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can manipulate other objects or rules by moving them. The goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, but maybe I can change that.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left, a door, walls, and some other rules like 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'ball', and 'is'. The 'win' is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall directly in the path. Wait, the wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. So I need to get past that. But how?

The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe if I pick up the key, but do I need it for the door? The door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can get the door moved or changed, maybe I can open it. But right now, the door's rule is 'door is stop', which makes it immovable. 

The 'is' rules are scattered around. If I can create a new rule like 'key is win', then grabbing the key would make me win. That could work. To do that, I need to move the 'is' text block next to 'key' and 'win'. Let's check their positions. 

There's an 'is' rule at 3 steps up, next to the 'win' rule. So if I can move that 'is' to connect 'key' and 'win', that might do it. But how do I move the 'is' block? I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a 'stop' or similar. The 'is' at 3 steps up is next to the 'win' rule. Maybe I can move right towards it. Wait, my position isn't clear here. Let me reconstruct the map based on the observations.

Baba is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down, according to the last observation. The 'is' rule is at 8 steps left and 3 steps down. So Baba is one step to the right of that 'is' rule. If I move right once, I can get to the 'is' block. Then, move it to the key's position. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, but moving the 'is' block requires being adjacent to it. 

If I move right from Baba's current position (9 left, 3 down) to the 'is' at 8 left, 3 down. Then, pick up the 'is' block and move it towards the key. The key is 8 left, 3 up. So I need to move up from the 'is' block. Once I place the 'is' next to 'key' and 'win', the new rule 'key is win' would activate, making the key act as a win condition. Then, picking up the key would make me win.

So the steps would be:
1. Move right to get to the 'is' block at 8 left, 3 down.
2. Pick up the 'is' block.
3. Move up to the key's location (8 left, 3 up).
4. Place the 'is' next to 'key' and 'win' to create 'key is win'.
5. Then, move to the key and touch it, which would now make me win.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door that can be altered. The door is at 7 left, 3 up, and it's defined as 'door is stop'. If I can change that to 'door is you' or something, but that might be tricky. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', maybe I can push other objects. But walls are 'stop', so I can't move them. The 'is' rules can be moved if they're not stopped. The 'is' at 3 steps up is next to 'win', so if I move that 'is' to connect 'key' and 'win', that's the plan.

So the immediate action should be to move right towards the 'is' block at 8 left, 3 down. Then, proceed to move up and place it. But the last observation shows that after moving right a couple times, I might be adjacent to the 'is' block. Let me check the previous steps.

In the last few actions, the user tried right, up, left, etc., but the system kept defaulting to idle because the actions weren't valid. Maybe the direction steps were misinterpreted. The problem is that the directions are relative, like ""1 step to the left and 6 step up"" — so the coordinates are a bit confusing. 

But focusing on the current position: Baba is at 9 left, 3 down. The 'is' block is at 8 left, 3 down. So to get there, move left once. Wait, no: if Baba is 9 left and the 'is' is 8 left, then moving left would take him further left, which is not correct. Wait, maybe the coordinates are absolute. For example, the map has a grid, and each object's position is relative to Baba's starting point. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify. The key is to move the 'is' rule next to 'key' and 'win' to create 'key is win'. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the 'is' block and then move it. The 'is' block is one step to the left of Baba's current position (since Baba is at 9 left, 3 down, and the 'is' is at 8 left, 3 down). So moving left once would place me next to the 'is' block. Then, pick it up and move up to the key's location.

So the correct action would be to move left to get to the 'is' block, then move up, then right or left to position the 'is' between 'key' and 'win'. But according to the latest observation, after previous moves, the 'is' block might have moved. 

Wait, the latest observation shows that after some right and up moves, the 'is' blocks are still in their positions. So the plan remains: move left to the 'is' at 8 left, 3 down, pick it up, move up to the key's position (8 left, 3 up), place the 'is' next to 'key' and 'win'. 

Therefore, the immediate action should be to move left once to reach the 'is' block. Then, move up. But since the system requires a single action at a time, the first step is to move left.

I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, I can interact with other objects by moving them, provided they aren't stopped. The goal is usually to reach the 'win' object, but I should check if any rules have changed that.

Looking at the objects:

- The key is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. Previously, it was further left, so maybe I moved it.
- The door is at 6 steps left and 3 steps up. That's near the key.
- There are walls (step) blocking paths.
- There's a 'win' rule at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, the 'win' object is defined by a rule. The current active rule is 'win' 2 steps right and 3 steps up. So, to win, I need to reach that position.

But how do I get there? The path might be blocked by walls or 'stop' properties. Let's check the other rules:

- There's a 'stop' rule at 6 steps left and 2 steps up. That wall is a STOP, so I can't push past it.
- The 'door' rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. So, if I can make the door not a stop, maybe I can open it. But right now, the door is probably a STOP because of the 'stop' rule.

Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks. The 'stop' rule is separate from the 'door' rule. So, the door is defined as 'door is ...' but the 'stop' rule might be affecting it. Or maybe not. Let me think.

The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can move any movable object. The walls are tagged as 'wall is stop,' meaning they can't be moved. The door is a separate object; its property depends on the rules. If there's a 'door is stop' rule, then it's immovable. But looking at the current observation, the 'door' rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps up, but I don't see a 'door is stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 6 left and 2 up. So the door might be movable unless there's a 'door is stop' rule.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"" right now. So other rules might have been removed or altered. Let me check the objects again.

In the current objects, there's a rule `door` 1 step to the right and 2 step up. But no `door is stop` rule. So the door's property is whatever is defined by existing rules. Since the default for a door is usually 'stop' unless changed, but here, maybe the 'stop' rule is elsewhere.

Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 6 left and 2 up, which is a wall. So that wall is stop. The door is at 6 left and 3 up (the door object), but the rule `door` is at 1 right and 2 up. Hmm, maybe the door's position is 6 left and 3 up, and the rule defining it is separate. I might be confused about how the positions work.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'door' is an object that's controlled by a rule. If there's a rule like ""door is stop,"" then the door would be immovable. But in the current observation, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" The other rules like 'wall is stop' might have been removed by previous actions.

Looking back at the history, in earlier observations, there were rules like 'wall is stop' and 'door is ...' But now, the active rules are only 'baba is you.' So other rules might have been moved or altered. That means the door's property might not be stop anymore. So maybe I can push the door?

Wait, but the door's position is at 6 left and 3 up. To reach the 'win' position at 2 right and 3 up, I need to get past the door. If the door is movable, I could push it out of the way. But if it's a stop, I can't.

So the key steps are:

1. Find a way to reach the 'win' position (2 right, 3 up).
2. The path might be blocked by the door at 6 left, 3 up.
3. To move the door, I need to either remove the 'stop' rule or change the door's property.

But right now, the active rules don't include any that make the door stop. The 'stop' rule is on a wall at 6 left, 2 up. So the door is probably movable.

So the plan could be:

- Move towards the door at 6 left, 3 up.
- Push it to the left or right to clear the path to the 'win' position.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to create a new rule. For example, if I can grab the 'is' text block and combine it with other rules to make Baba a win or something else.

Looking at the objects, there are multiple 'is' rules scattered around. For instance, there's a rule `is` at 1 step right and 3 up, another at 1 step right and 1 up, and another at 5 left.

If I can move an 'is' text block next to 'baba' and 'win', I could create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" making Baba itself the win condition. That would allow me to touch the 'win' area without needing to open the door.

Alternatively, create ""door is win"" so that pushing the door into the 'win' area would work, but that's less likely.

Another approach: The key is at 7 left, 3 up. If I can pick up the key and use it to unlock something, but I don't see a lock in the current observation. The door might require a key, but the key is already near the door. Maybe I need to bring the key to the door's position and then push the door.

But how to move the key? Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move any movable object (not stopped). The key isn't tagged as stop, so I can push it.

So steps:

1. Move right to reach the key at 7 left, 3 up. Currently, I'm at the position of 'baba' which is 9 left and 3 steps down. Let me check the exact positions.

Wait, the 'baba' object is at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. So my current position is 9 left, 3 down. The key is at 7 left, 3 up. So to get to the key, I need to move left (since 7 is left of 9) and up.

But moving left from 9 left would be towards 8, 7, etc. But how does the movement work? Each action is a step in a direction. So from 9 left, moving left would decrease the left steps. Wait, the directions are a bit confusing here. The way the positions are described might be in terms of steps relative to Baba's position. For example, ""key 9 step to the left"" means the key is 9 steps to the left of Baba. So if I move left, I would be closer to the key.

But perhaps the coordinates are Cartesian, where left is negative x, right is positive x, up is positive y, down is negative y. So Baba is at (0,0), and other objects are at positions like (-9, -3) for the 'baba' rule at 9 left and 3 down. The key is at (-7, 3). The 'win' is at (2,3).

So the path from Baba's position (-9, -3) to the key at (-7,3) would require moving right (increase x) and up (increase y). But the way the observations are described, the movement steps are relative. So to move from 9 left and 3 down to 7 left and 3 up, I need to move right twice (since 9 left to 7 left is 2 steps right) and up 6 steps (from 3 down to 3 up is 6 steps up). But that's a lot of steps, and maybe there are obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the level is smaller, and the steps are relative to the current position. For example, each 'step' is a single move in that direction. So to get from Baba's position to the key, which is 2 steps right and 6 steps up, but that's probably not feasible given the grid size.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are described in terms of how far they are from Baba's current position. For example, ""key 9 step to the left"" means the key is 9 steps to the left of where I am now. So moving left once would bring me 1 step closer to the key. But that would take 9 left moves, which is impractical.

This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the immediate surroundings. The 'win' is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from the current position. The door is at 6 left and 3 up. The key is at 7 left and 3 up. So perhaps the layout is:

Baba is at position (0,0).

Key: (-7, 3)

Door: (-6, 3)

Win: (2, 3)

Walls are at various positions, some marked as stop.

So to get to the win position (2,3), I need to go right twice and up three times. But the path is blocked by the door at (-6,3). If I can move the door, that would clear the path.

To move the door, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since the door is at (-6,3), and I'm at (0,0), I need to move left and up to reach it.

Let's calculate the path:

From (0,0) to (-6,3):

- Move left 6 times to reach x=-6.

- Then move up 3 times to reach y=3.

But along the way, there might be walls or stops. For example, the wall at (-4,3) (since the wall is 4 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba's original position? Wait, the wall objects are at varying positions. For instance, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up (object: wall 4 left, 3 up), which would be at (-4,3). So moving left from (0,0) to (-6,3) would pass through (-4,3), which is a wall. That's a stop, so I can't push past it.

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. If I can get the key first, maybe the key opens the door. But the key is at (-7,3), which is further left. To reach the key, I'd have to go left 7 steps and up 3, but there's a wall at (-4,3), so that path is blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule. For example, grab the 'is' text block and make a rule like ""door is you"" so that I can move the door. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the 'is' block and the door, then rearrange the text to form ""door is you"".

Looking at the objects, there's an 'is' rule at 1 step right and 3 up (which would be at (1,3) from Baba's position). So if I can move right to that 'is' block, then move up to the door at (-6,3), but that's a long way.

Alternatively, there's an 'is' rule at 1 step right and 1 step up (position (1,1)), and another at 5 left (which is (-5,0)).

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

Current active rule: baba is you.

Possible actions:

1. Move towards the 'is' rule at (1,3) to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win area would make me win.

To do that, I need to move an 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win'.

The 'win' rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up (position (2,3)). The 'baba' rule is at 9 left and 3 down (position (-9,-3)), but the actual Baba is at (0,0). Wait, maybe the positions are relative to Baba's current position. For example, the 'baba' text block is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down from Baba, meaning it's at (-9,-3) in absolute terms. Similarly, the 'win' rule is at 2 right and 3 up from Baba, so (2,3).

So to create a new rule like ""baba is win"", I need to place the text ""baba win is"" somewhere. That requires having the 'baba' text block, 'win' text block, and 'is' text block in the correct order.

The 'baba' text block is at (-9,-3), 'win' is at (2,3), and there are multiple 'is' blocks. For example, there's an 'is' at (1,3), another at (1,1), and another at (-5,0).

So the plan could be:

- Move right to the 'is' at (1,3), then move up to reach the 'win' at (2,3), but need to bring the 'baba' text block into position.

Alternatively, move to the 'is' at (1,1), which is closer.

Alternatively, use the 'is' at (-5,0), but that's further away.

This is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to move to the 'is' at (1,3) and combine it with 'baba' and 'win' to create ""baba is win"".

To do that, I need to be able to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba and can move anything not stopped, I can push the 'is' block to the desired position.

For example:

1. Move right to the 'is' at (1,3).
2. Move up to the 'win' at (2,3).
3. Place the 'is' between 'baba' and 'win' to form ""baba is win"".

But how to do that in the grid? Each move is a single step in a direction. So I need to navigate between the objects.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer 'is' block. The 'is' at 1 step right and 1 step up (position (1,1)) is closer. From Baba's position (0,0), moving right once and up once gets to (1,1), where the 'is' block is. Then, move right again to (2,1) to get near the 'win' which is at (2,3). But the 'win' is up two steps from there.

Alternatively, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to push the door out of the way. Since the door is at (-6,3), and I need to get to (2,3), the door is blocking the direct path.

To push the door, I need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position (0,0), moving left 6 times and up 3 times to reach the door. But along the way, there's a wall at (-4,3), which is a stop. So I can't move through that wall.

Therefore, pushing the door isn't feasible this way.

Alternative idea: Use the key. The key is at (-7,3). If I can pick up the key and bring it to the door, maybe the door requires a key to be opened. But I don't see any 'key is unlock' rule, so this might not help.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the door passable. For example, ""door is you"", so I can move through it. To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks to form ""door is you"".

There's a 'door' rule at (1,2) (since it's 1 step right and 2 steps up from Baba's position). An 'is' rule is at (1,3), and a 'you' rule is at (7,3 steps down) which is (-7,-3). So to create ""door is you"", I need to move the 'door' block next to 'is' and 'you'.

But the 'you' is quite far away at (-7,-3). That would require a lot of movement.

Alternatively, there's a 'you' rule at 7 step to the left and 3 steps down from Baba, which is (-7,-3). That's even further.

This seems too time-consuming. Maybe the intended solution is to create a rule that makes Baba the win condition.

To do that, I need to form ""baba is win"". The 'baba' text block is at (-9,-3), 'win' is at (2,3), and there are 'is' blocks at (1,3), (1,1), (-5,0), etc.

The closest 'is' block to the 'win' is at (1,3). So the plan could be:

1. Move right to (1,3) to get the 'is' block.
2. Move up to (2,3) where 'win' is.
3. Push the 'is' block between 'baba' and 'win' to form the new rule.

But how to move the 'is' block? Since I'm Baba and can move anything not stopped, I can push the 'is' block.

From (0,0) to (1,3):

- Move right once to (1,0).
- Move up three times to (1,3).

Once there, pick up the 'is' block and move it to between 'baba' and 'win'.

But 'baba' is at (-9,-3), which is far left. To reach there, I'd have to move left 9 times and down 3, which is not practical.

Alternative approach: Maybe create the rule ""win is baba"", making the win condition equivalent to Baba. But I'm already Baba, so touching the win area would win the level.

To create ""win is baba"", I need to arrange the text blocks accordingly.

The 'win' is at (2,3), 'is' is at (1,3), and 'baba' is at (-9,-3). So:

1. Move to the 'is' at (1,3).
2. Move left to (0,3), then to (-1,3), etc., but this is too far.

This seems","

76,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to get past this level in Baba Is You. Let's start by understanding the current situation based on the observation provided.

First, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do or move, Baba can interact with it. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case here. Looking at the objects, there are several ""win"" rules scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" and another ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right."" But I need to see if any of these are accessible.

Now, looking at the map layout, I see walls (labeled as `wall`) blocking paths. There's also a door (`door`) which might be moveable if I can push it. The key is nearby, but it's 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up from the current position. Wait, actually, the key's position might be relative to Baba's position. The observation lists objects with their positions relative to something, probably Baba. So the key is 7 steps left and 3 up from Baba. But I need to see if I can reach it to maybe use it on the door.

But the main challenge is the walls and the door. The door is 6 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can push the door, maybe I can open it to get to the win condition. However, doors are usually stoppable unless there's a rule that overrides that. The active rules include ""door is [something]"". Let me check the rules again.

Looking at the active rules: the main one is ""baba is you."" There's also ""rule `win` ..."" but those are just definitions of where the win condition is, not active rules. The other rules like ""wall is stop"" or ""door is stop"" might be relevant. Wait, in the objects list, there's a ""rule `stop` 8 step to the left and 5 step up"" and ""rule `door` 1 step to the right and 2 step up."" Hmm, not sure. Maybe the door's property is stop?

Wait, the initial rules when the level starts are crucial. The player usually starts with ""baba is you,"" and other rules like ""wall is stop,"" ""door is open,"" etc. But in this case, the current active rules only show ""baba is you."" The other rules are probably text blocks on the map that I can move to change the rules.

So, to solve this, I might need to move the ""is"" text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""door is you"" or ""key is win,"" but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba a different object. Since ""baba is you"" is the only active rule, I can move the ""is"" text block next to ""baba"" and another property to change my rules. For instance, moving ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""baba"" to make ""you is baba,"" but that might not help.

Alternatively, to reach the win condition, which is currently a rule at 2 steps to the right, I might need to move past the walls. The walls are stoppable unless I change their property. If I can make ""wall is nothing"" or ""wall is you,"" then I could push through them. To do that, I need to find the ""wall"" rule and rearrange it. The ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 5 step up"" might be the text block that defines wall's property. If I can move that text block next to an ""is"" and change it, say, to ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you,"" that might allow me to move through walls.

But how do I move the text blocks? The actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. Each action moves Baba one step in that direction, and if there's a text block or an object that's not stoppable, I can push it. So, for example, if I move right towards the ""is"" text block at 1 step to the right and 3 step up, I could potentially grab it and move it to rearrange a rule.

Looking at the current positions, the ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" is close. If I move right twice, I can reach that ""is"" block. Then, maybe move it down or left to combine with another rule. For instance, if I can move ""is"" next to ""key"" to make ""key is you,"" then I could become the key and use it to unlock the door. But the door's rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 step up, which is ""rule `door` ...""

Alternatively, maybe create a ""win is baba"" rule so that touching Baba counts as winning. But the existing ""win"" rules are just markers of where the win condition is located, not active rules. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so maybe if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching anything would win, but that's unlikely.

Another approach: Since the key is nearby (7 steps left and 3 up), maybe I need to get the key first. To do that, I have to navigate around the walls. The path to the key is blocked by walls at 4 steps left and 5 step up, but if I can make walls passable, I can go through them. So, moving the ""wall"" rule text block to change its property. The ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 5 step up"" is the definition of wall's property. If I can move this text block next to an ""is"" and another property, like ""nothing,"" to make ""wall is nothing,"" then walls become passable.

To do that, I need to move Baba to the position of the ""wall"" rule text block. The wall rule is at 9 steps left and 5 steps up. From the current position, moving left 9 steps and up 5 would get there, but that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" text block that I can use to rearrange the wall rule.

The closest ""is"" is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. If I move right to get to that ""is"" block, then maybe move it down to combine with the wall rule. For example, move right to the ""is"" block, then down to the wall rule, and rearrange them to make ""wall is [something else].""

But how to physically move the blocks? Each move action moves Baba one step, and if there's a movable object (not stoppable) in that direction, Baba can push it. So, if I'm next to the ""is"" block and move in the direction of the wall rule, I can push both.

Alternatively, maybe the key is more important. The key is at 7 left and 3 up. If I can get there, perhaps I can use it on the door. But the door is at 6 left and 3 up, which is adjacent to the key. If I have the key, maybe I can push the door by moving it with the key. But doors are usually stoppable unless a rule says otherwise. If the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" then I can't push it. But if I can change the door's rule to ""door is push,"" then I could move it.

So, the plan might be:

1. Move to the ""is"" text block at 1 step right and 3 up.
2. Use that ""is"" to change the door's property to ""push"" or remove the stop.
3. Then, push the door open to access the win condition.

Alternatively, change the wall's property to allow moving through them.

Another angle: Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that are not stop. So, if I can make walls not stop, I can move through them. To do that, find the ""wall is stop"" rule and rearrange it. The ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 5 step up"" is probably the wall's rule. If I can move this text block next to an ""is"" and another property, like ""nothing,"" to make ""wall is nothing.""

So steps:

- Move right to the ""is"" block at 1 step right, 3 up.
- Then move down to the wall rule at 9 left, 5 up. But directions are relative. Wait, the positions are given as steps left/right and up/down from Baba's current position. So if the ""is"" is 1 step right and 3 up, moving right would take Baba to that ""is"" block. Then, from there, moving left 8 steps and down 2 steps to reach the wall rule at 9 left and 5 up. That seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" block. There's another ""is"" at 6 left and 2 up. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects list:

- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 3 step up
- rule `is` 6 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 8 step to the left and 2 steps down

Wait, the third ""is"" is 6 steps to the left and 2 steps up. That might be nearer. If I can get to that ""is"" block, then maybe rearrange the wall rule.

But moving left 6 steps and up 2 from current position. Let's see: current position is where Baba is, with various objects around. The key is 7 left and 3 up, so perhaps moving left and up towards the key and the ""is"" blocks.

Alternatively, focus on the door. The door is at 6 left and 3 up. If I can make the door not stop, then I can push it. The door's rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up. So, the ""rule `door` 1 step to the right and 2 step up"" is the text block defining the door's property. If I can move this text block next to an ""is"" and change it, like ""door is push"" or ""door is you,"" then maybe I can push the door.

To do that, need to move to the door's rule. From current position, the door's rule is 1 right and 2 up. So move right once, then up twice to reach it. Once there, if I can grab the ""door"" rule and the ""is"" block nearby to rearrange them.

But the ""is"" blocks are scattered. The closest ""is"" to the door's rule is the one at 1 step right and 3 step up. So, move right to that ""is"" block, then move down to the door's rule. Then, rearrange them to make ""door is [something else].""

For example, if I can make ""door is push,"" then I can push the door. Let's try that.

Steps:

1. Move right twice to reach the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 3 up (since first move right gets to 1 right, 3 up; second move right might get to another position? Wait, the positions are relative. Maybe each ""step"" is a grid move. So, starting at Baba's position, moving right once takes him to the right, and the ""is"" block is there. Then, moving up from there to get to the door's rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the key and use it. But the key is behind a wall at 4 left and 5 up. Wait, no, the walls are at 4 left and 3 up, 4 left and 2 up, etc. So the path to the key is via moving left and up, but there are walls in the way. If I can make walls passable by changing their rule, that would help.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the wall if it's not stop. But the wall's rule is ""stop,"" so I can't. So I need to change that.

To change the wall's rule from ""stop"" to something else, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and rearrange it. The ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 5 step up"" is probably the text block for the wall's property. So moving to that location and combining it with an ""is"" and another property.

Let's break it down:

- Current position: Assume Baba is at the origin (0,0).
- The ""wall"" rule is at (-9,5) (9 steps left, 5 up).
- The ""is"" block is at (1,3) (1 right, 3 up).

So, from Baba's current position, moving right once gets to (1,0). Then moving up three times gets to (1,3), which is the ""is"" block. From there, moving left 8 times and down 2 times to reach (-9,5). That's a lot of moves, but possible.

Once at (-9,5), which is the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can rearrange it by combining with the ""is"" block. But I need another property to change it to. For example, if I can create ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you.""

But where is the ""push"" or ""you"" text blocks? Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down."" So that's at (-7,-3). To get there from (-9,5), I need to move right 2 and down 8, which is again a long way.

This seems too tedious. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" block. The other ""is"" blocks are at 3 step up, 6 left and 2 up, etc. Let's see:

- ""rule `is` 3 step up"" is at (0,3).
- ""rule `is` 6 step to the left and 2 step up"" is at (-6,2).
- ""rule `is` 8 step to the left and 2 steps down"" is at (-8,-2).

Assuming the closest ""is"" block is at (0,3) (3 step up). From Baba's position, moving up three times to get there. Then, move left or right to find the wall rule.

But the wall rule is at (-9,5), which is left and up from (0,3). So from (0,3), move left 9 and up 2. Again, too far.

Alternatively, maybe the key is more urgent. The key is at (-7,3). To get there, Baba needs to move left 7 and up 3. But the path is blocked by walls at (-4,3), (-4,2), etc. If walls are stoppable, can't go through. So need to change wall rule.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block next to the ""key"" rule to make ""key is you,"" allowing Baba to become the key and unlock the door.

The key's rule is at (1,1) (1 step right, 1 step up). There's an ""is"" block at (1,3) (1 right, 3 up). So moving down from (1,3) to (1,1) where the key rule is. Then, rearrange ""key is"" to ""you is key"" or something. Wait, the key rule is ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 1 step up,"" which means ""key is [property]"". The current property isn't shown, but in typical levels, the key might be ""key is push"" or similar. But here, the active rule is just ""baba is you,"" so the key's property might be default.

By moving the ""is"" block next to the key rule, we can create a new rule. For example, if the key rule is ""key is [something]"" and we add an ""is"" next to it, we can change the property. Suppose the key's current rule is ""key is push,"" but we need to make it ""key is win"" or ""key is you.""

Wait, the key's rule is listed as ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" That probably means the text block is ""key is [property]"" but the property is missing or default. To change it, we need to add the property using an ""is"" block.

So, if I can move the ""is"" block at (1,3) down to (1,1) where the key rule is, then combine them to make ""key is you."" That way, when I push the key, I become the key, and since the door might be pushable if its rule is changed, or maybe the key can be used on the door.

Alternatively, making ""key is win"" would make touching the key win the game.

But how to do that? Let's outline the steps:

1. Move right once to reach the ""is"" block at (1,3).
2. Move down twice to reach the key rule at (1,1).
3. Now, the ""key"" text block is at (1,1), and the ""is"" is at (1,3). Wait, no. If I move down from (1,3) to (1,2), then (1,1), that's two moves down. At (1,1), there's the key rule: ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 1 step up,"" which is the text block ""key is [property]"". The property is missing here, so it's likely ""key is"" followed by nothing, or the default property.

By placing an ""is"" next to it, we can define the property. For example, if we have ""key is you,"" then pushing the key would make Baba the key. Alternatively, ""key is win"" would make touching the key a win.

So, moving the ""is"" block from (1,3) to (1,1) next to the key rule. Then, the text becomes ""key is you,"" making the key a ""you"" object, so when I push the key, I become the key. Then, if the door can be pushed, I might be able to move it, or the key might unlock the door.

Alternatively, if I make the key a win, then touching it would win.

But how to physically move the ""is"" block to the key rule's position. Let's see:

Current position after moving right once: (1,0). Then move up three times to get to (1,3), which is the ""is"" block. From there, move down twice to (1,1), where the key rule is. Once there, if I can push the ""","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" is 2 steps to the right at the same level as the key. There's also a door nearby. The key is 7 steps left and 3 up, but after moving left earlier, maybe I'm closer now. Wait, the current observation shows the key is 7 steps left and 3 up, door is 6 left and 3 up, wall 3 left and 3 up. There's a ""rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up,"" so that's in the same row as the door and key but shifted right.

I need to get to the win. The path might be blocked by walls or stops. Let's see the walls: there's a wall at 3 left, 3 up, and others below. The rule `door` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. So maybe the door is a stop unless I change the rule. But since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, perhaps I can move the ""door"" rule to make it something else.

The ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can grab that ""is"" rule and move it to reassign a property. For example, if I make ""door IS WIN,"" then touching the door would make me win. Alternatively, make ""BABA IS WIN"" so that I am the win condition.

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block. Let's check where the ""is"" rules are. There's one at 1 step right and 3 step up, another at 1 step right and 1 step up, and another at 5 step left. Maybe I can move the upper ""is"" to combine with ""door"" and ""win.""

If I move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win,"" then ""door IS WIN"" would activate. Then, stepping on the door would make me win. Alternatively, moving ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba IS win,"" but I need to see where Baba is located.

Looking at the objects, rule `baba` is at 8 step left and 3 steps down. So Baba is positioned somewhere else. To reach the win, maybe I need to get past the door. If I can change the door's property to not be a stop, or make it a win.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects. The key is nearby; if I can get the key and use it to unlock the door, but there's no ""unlock"" rule here. Maybe the door is a stop, so I can't pass through it unless I change its rule.

So the plan could be: move the ""is"" rule next to ""door"" and ""win"" to create ""door IS WIN,"" then go to the door and step on it to win. To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""is"" rule is, which is 1 step right and 3 step up. But where am I currently located? The observation doesn't specify my position, but since the key was previously 9 steps left, and after moving left, now it's 7 steps left. Maybe I'm near the key area.

Alternatively, I can move the ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 step up to be next to ""door"" (6 left, 3 up) and ""win"" (2 right, 3 up). Wait, the ""win"" is 2 steps to the right at 3 step up. The ""door"" is at 6 step left and 3 step up. The ""is"" is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So if I move the ""is"" rule from (1 right, 3 up) to between ""door"" and ""win,"" maybe position it so that it says ""door IS WIN.""

To do that, I would need to move the ""is"" text block. Since I'm Baba, I can move objects that aren't STOP. The ""is"" rule isn't STOP, so I can move it. The action would be to move the ""is"" rule to the right or left to attach it to door and win.

But how to translate that into the game's actions. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. Wait, no—actually, the user is supposed to output a direction (up, down, left, right) to move Baba, or other actions like pushing objects. But based on the initial problem statement, the actions are moving directions. However, in Baba Is You, you can push objects by moving towards them while holding a text block. But the actions listed are only the directions. Maybe the assistant is supposed to decide which direction to move, possibly to reach a text block to manipulate.

In the current observation, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I'm currently near the key area (7 left, 3 up), moving right would take me towards the ""is"" rule. Then, once I'm next to it, I can move it to the door and win.

So the sequence would be: move right to reach the ""is"" rule, then move right again to position it next to the door, then maybe up or down to attach it to win. But each move is a single step. Alternatively, if I can push the ""is"" rule by moving towards it while holding it, but I need to be adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to move right to get closer to the ""is"" rule so I can then move it to create the new rule. Since the previous actions were moving left, right, up, etc., perhaps the next step is to move right towards the ""is"" rule located at 1 step right and 3 step up.

Looking at the current position of the key, which is 7 steps left and 3 up, and the ""is"" rule is 1 step right and 3 step up. So if I'm at the key's location, moving right once would place me next to the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move that ""is"" rule to the door's position by moving left, attaching it to door and win.

But the action here must be a single direction. So the first step is to move right to reach the ""is"" rule. Therefore, the chosen action should be ""right"".

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but sometimes the rules change that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the left and up, a door also to the left and up, walls, and some rule text blocks. The WIN object is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a door blocking the path. The door is defined by the ""door is stop"" rule, which means I can't pass through it unless I change that rule.

Since I'm Baba and I can move text blocks, maybe I can rewrite the rule for the door. The ""door is stop"" rule is located 2 steps up. If I can move that rule away or change it to something else, the door might become passable. Also, there's another ""is"" rule nearby. If I can combine them, perhaps create a new rule like ""door is you"" or ""door is win,"" but I need to see where the text blocks are.

The key is nearby, but I need to reach it first. To get the key, which is 8 steps left and 3 steps up, I might have to move left or up. However, there are walls in the way. The walls are defined by ""wall is stop,"" so I can't move through them unless I change that rule too. But right now, the main obstacle is the door blocking the path to the WIN object.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the WIN condition. There's a ""win is ..."" rule somewhere. Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that to a different object, like making ""key"" the win condition, then grabbing the key would be the solution. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule text block next to the key and change it to ""key is win.""

But how do I move the text blocks? The rules are ""is"" blocks that I can pick up and place elsewhere. For example, the ""is"" block at 3 steps up could be used to create a new rule. If I take the ""is"" block and place it next to ""door"" and ""stop,"" maybe I can change ""door is stop"" to ""door is push"" or something else. But I need to see the exact positions.

Wait, the current active rules are only ""baba is you."" All other rules are text blocks on the map that I can manipulate. So, the strategy would be to pick up an ""is"" block and combine it with other objects to create a new rule. For instance, moving the ""is"" block at 3 steps up next to ""door"" and ""stop"" to change the rule from ""door is stop"" to something else, like ""door is you,"" making the door itself controllable.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""key"" the win condition. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move the ""win"" rule (which is currently 1 step right and 3 steps up) to the key's position and change it to ""key is win,"" then stepping on the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to the key's location and attach the ""is"" block to it.

But moving the text blocks requires that I'm not pushed by STOP objects. The walls are STOP, so I have to be careful not to move into them. Let me check the positions again. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. The closest ""is"" block might be at 3 step up. If I move right from my current position, can I reach that ""is"" block?

Alternatively, maybe I should first go get the key to have it in hand when manipulating rules. But the path to the key is blocked by the door. So perhaps I need to remove the door's STOP property first. If I change ""door is stop"" to ""door is you,"" then I can push the door out of the way. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule that's attached to the door.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 7 left, 2 step up, and a ""door"" rule at 2 step up. So the ""door is stop"" rule is formed by the ""door"" text block next to the ""stop"" text block. If I can separate them or replace the ""stop"" with something else, like ""you,"" then the door becomes controllable.

To do that, I need to pick up the ""is"" block and rearrange the rules. For example, take the ""is"" block at 1 step up and place it next to ""door"" and ""you"" (which is at 7 left, 3 steps down). But that might be complicated. Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 6 left to create a new rule. 

Wait, the current ""is"" blocks are at 3 step up, 1 step up, 6 step left, etc. Maybe I can use the one at 3 step up to connect ""door"" with ""you."" If I move that ""is"" block next to ""door"" (which is at 2 step up) and ""you"" (which is at 7 left, 3 steps down), but that's quite far. Alternatively, find a closer ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 7 left, 1 step down. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The goal is to reach WIN, which is currently blocked by a door that's STOP.
2. To pass the door, change its rule from STOP to something else, like YOU, so I can push it.
3. Alternatively, change the WIN condition to KEY so that grabbing the key wins.
4. To do either, I need to manipulate the text blocks by moving ""is"" rules next to the target objects.

Let's focus on changing the door's rule. The door is at 7 left, 3 step up, and the ""door is stop"" rule is formed by the ""door"" text block at 2 step up and the ""stop"" text block at 7 left, 2 step up. If I can remove the ""stop"" from the door's rule, or replace it with ""you,"" that would work.

To replace ""stop"" with ""you,"" I need to:

- Move the ""is"" block that's connecting ""door"" to ""stop"" (probably the one at 3 step up) to a new position.
- Place the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you"" instead.

But how to do that step by step. Let's say I'm currently at Baba's position, which is at 9 left, 3 steps down. The ""is"" block I need is at 3 step up. If I move up to that ""is"" block, then I can carry it and place it elsewhere.

So actions could be:

1. Move up to get the ""is"" block at 3 step up.
2. Then move to the door's location (7 left, 3 step up) and place the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""you"" (7 left, 1 step down). But that's a distance. Maybe there's a closer ""you.""

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 7 left, 1 step down. So from the ""is"" block at 3 step up, I need to move down to 1 step down, which is 2 steps down. But that might not be possible due to walls.

Alternatively, use another ""is"" block. There's an ""is"" block at 6 step left. Maybe that's closer to the ""you"" rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the quickest way is to move the ""win"" rule to the key's position. The key is at 8 left, 3 step up, and the ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 3 step up. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the key's location, then stepping on the key would make me win.

To move the ""win"" rule, I need to pick it up (since it's a text block) and carry it to the key. But I have to avoid STOP objects. The path from the ""win"" rule (1 right, 3 up) to the key (8 left, 3 up) is blocked by walls? Let me check the map:

Looking at the current objects, between the win rule and the key, there are walls at 4 step left and 3 step up. So moving from the win position (1 right, 3 up) to the key (8 left, 3 up) would require moving left past walls which are STOP. Since I'm Baba and can't pass through STOP, I can't move through those walls. So that path is blocked.

Alternative approach: Instead of moving the win rule, create a new rule that makes the key win. To do that, I need to have the ""key is win"" rule. The key is at 8 left, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. The ""is"" block is at 3 step up. So if I can move the ""is"" block to between ""key"" and ""win,"" that would create ""key is win.""

But how to get to that position. The ""is"" block is at 3 step up, which is the same level as the key and win. If I can move right from the ""is"" block's position (3 step up) to the key's location (8 left, 3 up), but that's 5 steps left. However, there are walls at 4 step left and 3 step up, which are STOP. So I can't move through them. 

This seems tricky. Maybe another way: Use the ""is"" block at 6 step left. If I move that ""is"" block next to ""key"" and ""win,"" but the ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up, which is quite far. 

Alternatively, change the door's rule to allow passage. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. The ""door is stop"" rule is made by the ""door"" block at 2 step up and ""stop"" block at 7 left, 2 step up. If I can separate them or replace ""stop"" with ""you.""

To replace ""stop"" with ""you,"" I need to:

1. Pick up the ""is"" block that's connecting ""door"" to ""stop"" (probably the one at 3 step up).
2. Move that ""is"" block away.
3. Then place a new ""is"" block connecting ""door"" to ""you.""

But where is the ""you"" block? It's at 7 left, 3 steps down. That's quite far from the door. 

Alternatively, use another ""is"" block. There's an ""is"" block at 1 step up. Maybe move that one.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" block at 3 step up to manipulate the rules. So the next action should be to move up to get that ""is"" block.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the 'win' object, which is probably the door or something similar. But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" meaning whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and up, and a door further left and up. There are also some 'rule' blocks scattered around. The 'win' is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But the path might be blocked by walls or stop properties. 

I need to check if I can move the 'win' rule or change the door's property. Wait, there's a 'rule `is`' block at 3 steps up. Maybe I can pick that up and move it to combine with other rules. For example, if I can make 'baba is win' or 'door is win', that would let me step on the door to win.

But first, I need to move. The key is to the left and up, but the current position might be near the 'rule `is`' block. If I move up to grab that 'is' rule, then I can create a new rule. Let's see, moving up would get me closer to the 'is' block at 3 step up. From there, maybe I can combine it with 'door' or 'baba' to change their properties.

Alternatively, there's another 'is' rule at 6 steps to the left. If I can move left to that, maybe I can create a rule like 'door is win'. But moving left might take several steps. However, the current active rule is 'baba is you', so I can push or move objects that aren't stopped. The walls are defined as 'wall', so any object labeled 'wall' or 'stop' can't be moved. 

Looking at the map, the 'rule `is`' at 3 step up is movable. If I move up once, I can be next to it. Then, maybe I can pick it up and move it to where the 'door' is, and combine it with 'door' and 'win' to make 'door is win'. That way, stepping on the door would make it a win condition.

So the steps would be: move up to reach the 'is' rule, then move right or left to position it near the door and the 'win' rule. Then, push them together to form the new rule. Once that's done, moving to the door would make it the win condition.

But I need to check the directions. The 'is' rule is 3 steps up. The current position isn't specified, but from previous observations, after some left and right moves, perhaps the agent is near the key or the 'baba' rule. Assuming the agent is at the same position as the 'baba' rule, which is 9 steps left and 3 steps down, but that might not be the case. 

Alternatively, the agent might be near the 'key' or the 'win' rule. If the 'win' is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, maybe the agent is positioned to the left of that. In that case, moving right would get closer. But since the active rule is 'baba is you', the agent can move freely unless there's a 'stop' property. 

Wait, the walls are labeled as 'wall', so any movement into a 'wall' is blocked. The 'stop' property also prevents moving through. So the agent needs to find a path around the walls. 

Looking at the objects again: there's a 'rule `is`' at 3 step up. If the agent moves up, they can pick that up. Then, moving right towards the 'win' rule and the 'door' to combine them. 

So the immediate action should be to move up to grab the 'is' rule. That way, the agent can then create the necessary rule to change the win condition. Once that's done, moving to the door would result in a win.

The active rule is still ""baba is you"", which means I can move around freely unless there's a ""stop"" or ""wall"" blocking me. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed here. Let me check the objects.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 8 steps left and 3 up. The door is 7 left and 3 up. There's a wall at 4 left and 3 up. Then there are some rules like ""is"" at 3 step up, ""win"" is 1 step right and 3 up. So the ""win"" is to the right of where the ""is"" rule is. Wait, but how do I reach it? Because there are walls and stop signs in the way. 

The rule blocks might be important. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. That might mean objects or paths there are impassable. The ""door"" rule is at 2 step up, so maybe the door at 7 left and 3 up is a stop unless changed. But since ""baba is you"", maybe I can push or move the door? Or maybe change the door's rule.

Wait, the key is nearby. If I can get the key, maybe that unlocks the door. But how? The key is at 8 left, 3 up. My current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. Let me assume I'm at the default starting point, maybe near the lower part. The ""baba"" text block is at 9 left and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to move towards the key first.

But moving right might lead me towards the win condition. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up. If I can get there, but there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up. Wait, the wall is at 4 left, 3 up. So between me (assuming I'm at 4 left?) and the win, there's a wall. Hmm. Maybe I need to move the wall or change its rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 9 left and 2 up. If I can move that text block to somewhere else, maybe I can remove the wall's ""stop"" property.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can be ""you"", maybe I can push the wall? But walls are usually stop. Unless I change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 4 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall might become passable.

Looking at the objects, there are multiple ""is"" rules. For example, ""rule `is` 6 step to the left"" and others. Maybe I can pick up an ""is"" rule and combine it with ""wall"" to change its property. Like, making ""wall is not stop"" or ""wall is you"". But how? To do that, I need to move the ""is"" text block next to the ""wall"" rule and rearrange them to form a new rule.

The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is nearby the ""win"" rule. If I can get there, maybe I can create a new rule like ""win is you"" or something. But the active rule is still ""baba is you"", so maybe I can be the win by making ""baba is win"". Wait, but the current active rules don't have that. 

Alternatively, the door is at 7 left and 3 up. If I can change the door's rule to ""door is win"", then reaching the door would make me win. But the door's rule is ""rule `door` 2 step up"", so maybe moving that rule next to the door and changing it. 

Let me try to visualize the map. The key is to the left of the door. The win is to the right of the ""is"" rule. The walls are blocking the direct path. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 4 up, which might be above the door area. 

If I move right from my current position (assuming I'm near the lower left), I might hit the wall at 4 left and 3 up. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to go up first to bypass the wall. The ""is"" rule is at 3 step up, so moving up there might allow me to manipulate rules. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 3 step up is near the ""win"" rule. If I can pick up that ""is"" rule and combine it with ""win"" to make ""win is you"", then touching the win object would make me win. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? Since I'm Baba and can move anything not stopped, I need to check if the ""is"" rule is movable. The ""is"" rule's position is 3 step up. Are there any stop rules there? The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 4 up, which is to the right and below the ""is"" rule. So the ""is"" rule at 3 step up is likely movable. 

So the plan could be: move up to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then move right to the ""win"" rule which is 1 step right from there. Then, combine them into ""win is you"" by placing them adjacent. That way, the active rule becomes ""win is you"", and touching the win object would make me win. 

But to do that, I need to navigate to that area. Let's see: from the current position (assuming I'm near the lower left where the ""baba"" rule is), moving right towards the key and door might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, moving up first. The latest observation shows that after some actions, the key moved to 7 left and 3 up, door to 6 left, etc. So maybe the player is moving left and up, causing the key and door to shift? Or perhaps the map is scrolling as the player moves. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is near the ""key"" at 1 step right and 1 step down. If I can move down to where the key is, pick up the key, then use it on the door. But how does the key work in Baba Is You? Usually, you push the key to a door to unlock it. But since I'm Baba and can be you, maybe I can move the key to the door's location and then the door becomes passable. 

The door's rule is at 2 step up. If I can move the door's rule (which is a text block) to somewhere else, or change its property. For example, if the door's rule is ""door is stop"", changing it to ""door is you"" would make me able to push it or pass through. 

But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks. The ""is"" rules are scattered. There's an ""is"" at 6 step to the left, which might be near the lower part. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""door"" rule, I could create ""door is you"". 

Alternatively, the ""ball"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. Not sure if that's relevant. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and can be you, maybe I can push the wall. If the wall is a stop, but I'm you, can I push it? In some levels, if you are the subject and the object is stop, you can't move through, but you can push it if you are the same as the object. Wait, the rules might be different. If ""baba is you"" and ""wall is stop"", then as you (Baba), you cannot push the wall because it's stop. Unless there's a rule allowing it. 

Alternatively, if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is you"", then the wall would become movable. To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule (which is at 9 left and 2 up) and the ""stop"" rule (7 left and 4 up) and rearrange them with an ""is"" to make ""wall is you"". 

This seems complicated. Let me think step by step. 

Current active rules: ""baba is you"". So I'm controllable. 

Key is at 8 left, 3 up. Door at 7 left, 3 up. Wall at 4 left, 3 up. 

The ""win"" is at 1 right, 3 up. So if I could get past the wall at 4 left, 3 up, I could reach the win. But the wall is there. 

The ""is"" rule is at 3 step up. Maybe I can move there, pick up the ""is"" rule, and then move to the ""win"" rule which is adjacent, and create ""win is you"". 

So the steps would be: move up to the ""is"" at 3 step up, then right to the ""win"" at 1 right, 3 up. Then place the ""is"" between ""win"" and ""you"" to make ""win is you"". 

But how do I know where ""you"" is? There's a ""you"" rule at 7 left and 3 steps down. That's far away. Maybe I can't reach it. Alternatively, since the active rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can use that ""you"" to make ""win is you"". 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is a separate text block. To create ""win is you"", I need to have ""win"", ""is"", and ""you"" adjacent. If I can move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""win"" and ""is"", that would work. But the ""you"" is at 7 left and 3 steps down, which is quite far from the ""win"" at 3 step up. 

This seems challenging. Maybe another approach: use the key to unlock the door. If the door is a stop, but I have a key, maybe placing the key next to the door would change its rule. In some levels, putting a key on a door makes it passable. But in Baba Is You, you have to push the key to the door, and then the door's rule changes. 

The key is at 8 left, 3 up. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. So they are adjacent. If I can move the key to the door's position, then the door might become unlockable. But to move the key, I need to be able to push it. Since I'm Baba and you, and the key's rule isn't specified (assuming it's a movable object), I can push it. 

So steps: move right towards the key, pick it up, move right to the door, place the key there. Then the door's rule might change to ""door is win"" or become passable. 

But how does that work in the game? When you push a key to a door, it usually creates a ""key is door"" or similar rule, allowing you to pass. Alternatively, the door's rule changes to ""door is you"" if the key is placed on it. 

Assuming that placing the key on the door makes it passable, then after doing that, I could go through the door to reach the win. 

But in the current map, the door is at 7 left, 3 up, and the key is at 8 left, 3 up. So they are next to each other vertically? Or horizontally? The description says the key is 8 steps left and 3 up, door is 7 left and 3 up. So same vertical position, key is one step left of the door. So horizontally adjacent. 

So I can move from the key's position to the door's position by moving left. But I need to pick up the key first. Since I'm Baba and you, I can move the key. 

So action sequence: move right to the key's location (8 left, 3 up), then move left to the door's location (7 left, 3 up), placing the key there. Then the door's rule might change, allowing passage. 

But after doing that, what's next? The door is now passable, so I can move through it to the other side, which might be the win area. 

Alternatively, after placing the key on the door, the win could be behind the door. 

Alternatively, the win is at 1 step right and 3 up from the current ""is"" rule. If I can make the win into a you rule, then touching it would win. 

Another angle: the ""rule `is` 6 step to the left"" is perhaps a floating ""is"" that I can pick up and use to create new rules. For example, moving that ""is"" to the ""win"" and ""you"" to make ""win is you"". 

But the ""you"" is at 7 left and 3 steps down, which is far away. Unless there's a way to move it. 

Alternatively, since the active rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can use that ""you"" to imply that any new rule involving ""you"" is valid. For example, creating ""win is you"" by placing ""win"", ""is"", and the existing ""you"" rule together. 

But the ""you"" is far down, so I need to transport it. Maybe by moving it using other objects. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to prioritize. The most immediate goal is to reach the win object. The win is at 1 right, 3 up, but blocked by a wall at 4 left, 3 up. 

If I can remove the wall's stop property, then the path is clear. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 9 left, 2 up, and the ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 4 up. 

To change ""wall is stop"" to something else, I need to move these text blocks. For example, move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and replace ""stop"" with another property. 

But how? The ""is"" rules are scattered. There's an ""is"" at 6 step to the left, which might be near the lower part. If I can move that ""is"" to the ""wall"" rule's position and combine it with ""stop"" to make ""wall is [something else]"". 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 3 step up. If I move that ""is"" to the ""wall"" rule (9 left, 2 up) and the ""stop"" rule (7 left, 4 up), maybe rearrange them to form ""wall is you"" or ""stop is you"", which would remove the stop property. 

This requires navigating to those areas. Let's see: from the current position (assuming I'm near the lower left where the ""baba"" rule is at 9 left, 3 steps down), moving up to the ""is"" at 3 step up, then moving right to the ""wall"" rule at 9 left, 2 up. But the path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" at 3 step up is at position 3 up, so moving up from the starting point (assuming starting at 0,0) would get there. 

This is quite complex. Considering the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the win area and manipulate the ""is"" rule there. 

So the chosen action would be to move up towards the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then right to the ""win"" rule, and place the ""is"" to make ""win is you"". 

Therefore, the action should be up, then right, then up again. But the system requires a single action per step. 

In the latest observation, after previous actions, the key is at 8 left, 3 up, door at 7 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 3 step up. So to get there, I need to move up three times? Or is the step count relative? 

The observation says ""rule `is` 3 step up"", so moving up once would get to that position. 

So the first action should be up to reach the ""is"" rule. Then, move right to the ""win"" which is 1 step right. Then, move right again to position next to ""win"" and ""you"". But ""you"" is far away. 

Alternatively, since the active rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can use the existing ""you"" to make ""win is you"". But the ""you"" is at 7 left and 3 steps down. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best immediate action is to move up to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, pick it up, and then move right to the ""win"" location to create the new rule. 

So the action would be up.

I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach a WIN object, but sometimes the rules can change that. Let me look at the current observation again.

Active rules: Only ""baba is you"". So right now, I am Baba. That means I can move around unless something is STOP. Let's check the objects on the map.

There's a key located 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 7 steps left and 3 steps up. Then walls starting at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. There are some rule blocks: `is` at 3 steps up, `win` 1 step to the right and 3 up, `wall` further left at 2 steps up, `stop` at 7 left and 2 up, another wall there. Then `door` rule at 2 steps up, more walls down.

Looking at the positions, the key and door are both above me, and there are walls blocking the path. The `win` rule is near the door, which is probably the exit. But the door is likely a STOP because the rule says ""door IS stop"" somewhere? Wait, let me check the active rules. No, the active rules only state ""baba is you"". The other rules like `door is stop` must be present as text blocks on the map but maybe not active yet.

Wait, the objects listed include rule `door` at 2 step up. So that would mean ""door is"" something. But what's the property? Since the active rules don't show it, maybe it's part of a rule that's not currently active. For example, if there's a text block saying ""door is stop"", then door would be stop. But in the current active rules, I don't see that. So maybe the door is not stop right now.

But how do I know? The active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules are present as objects but not active unless concatenated. So perhaps I need to move those rule blocks to form new rules.

The `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 up. If I can get to that, maybe I can combine it with something else. But the path is blocked by walls and the door. The key is to the left and up, but there are walls there too. Let me see the positions again.

The key is 8 left, 3 up. The `win` is 1 right, 3 up. So if I can move up to the `win` rule, maybe I can change the win condition. But how? I need to form a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the win object would make me win. Or maybe ""flag is win"" if there's a flag, but there's no flag here.

Alternatively, the `door` is at 7 left, 3 up. If I can move the `is` rule next to `door` and `stop`, then ""door is stop"" would become an active rule. But the `stop` rule is at 7 left, 2 up. So maybe I need to rearrange those blocks.

But right now, I'm Baba, and I can move unless there's a STOP. The walls are at 4 left, 3 up, and others. So moving left into the wall would be stop, but since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", maybe I can push or move the walls if they're not stop. Wait, no. The walls are objects; unless there's a rule that says ""wall is push"" or something, I can't move them. But the default is that STOP objects can't be moved. So if a wall is STOP, I can't push it. But since the active rules don't specify that walls are stop, maybe they're not. Wait, no—the `wall` rule is at 9 left, 2 up. So that would mean ""wall is"" something. But the active rule is only ""baba is you"". So the `wall` rule is probably part of a rule like ""wall is stop"", but it's split into separate blocks. So to activate that rule, I need to bring the `wall` block next to the `stop` block and the `is` block.

But how do I get there? My current position isn't clear, but looking at the objects, the `key` is at 8 left, 3 up. The `win` is at 1 right, 3 up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up. Maybe I need to move up to the `is` rule and combine it with other blocks.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I should first grab the key to have an item. The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. But moving left into the walls might be blocked. Let's see the layout:

Starting position (assuming Baba is at the position of the `baba` rule block, which is 9 left, 3 steps down). So from there, moving up would take me towards the `is` rule at 3 step up. Moving left would go towards the walls at 4 left, 3 up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial position of Baba is where the `baba` rule block is located: 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. So to get to the `is` rule at 3 step up, I need to move up 3 steps. But between there are walls at 4 step left and 3 step up. So maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rule blocks. For example, to create ""door is win"", which would make the door a win condition. But the `door` rule is at 2 step up, and `win` is at 1 right, 3 step up. So I need to move those blocks together.

But how do I move the blocks? Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", I can push objects that are not STOP. So if a wall is not STOP, I can push it. But the walls here might be STOP if there's a rule saying so. Let's check the active rules again. The active rules are only ""baba is you"". The `wall` rule is at 9 left, 2 up, which would be part of a rule like ""wall is stop"" if combined with the `stop` block. So if I can bring the `wall` and `stop` blocks together with an `is`, then ""wall is stop"" becomes active, making walls STOP and unable to be pushed.

But right now, those blocks are separate. The `stop` rule is at 7 left, 2 up. The `wall` rule is at 9 left, 2 up. So they're two steps apart. To move them together, I would need to push them, but if they're not STOP yet, I can. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, focus on creating a ""baba is win"" rule. The `win` rule is at 1 right, 3 up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up. So if I can move the `win` block next to the `is` and then maybe combine with another block, but I don't see a `baba` block nearby except the rule at 9 left, 3 steps down. That's far away.

Alternatively, maybe the key is irrelevant, and I should focus on reaching the `win` rule. But the path is blocked by walls and the door. If the door is not a STOP, I can move through it. But if it is STOP, I can't. Since the active rules don't have ""door is stop"", the door is passable unless there's another rule making it STOP. But the `door` rule is separate; it needs to be combined with `stop` and `is` to activate.

So maybe the solution is to rearrange the rule blocks to create ""door is win"", making the door a win condition. Then moving through the door would win the level. To do that, I need to get the `door` block next to the `win` block and an `is` block.

The `door` rule is at 2 step up. The `win` rule is at 1 right, 3 step up. The `is` rule is at 3 step up. So if I can move the `door` block to be adjacent to `win` and `is`, that would work. But how to move them?

Since I'm Baba, I can push objects that are not STOP. The walls might be STOP if the ""wall is stop"" rule is active. But right now, that rule isn't active. The `wall` rule is separate. So perhaps the walls can be pushed.

Let me visualize the grid. Suppose Baba is at position (0,0). The `baba` rule is at (9, -3). The `is` rule is at (0,3). The `win` is at (1,3). The `door` rule is at (0,2). The `stop` rule is at (-7,2). The `wall` rule is at (-9,2). So to get from Baba's position to the `is` rule at (0,3), need to move right and up. But there are walls at ( -4,3), ( -4,2), etc. So path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go to the `is` rule at (0,3) and combine it with `door` (0,2) and `win` (1,3). If I can arrange them horizontally or vertically.

But how to move the `door` block from (0,2) to (0,3) next to `is` and `win`. Let's see. To move the `door` block up to (0,3), I need to push it. Since it's a text block, and unless it's STOP, I can push it. If the `door` is not STOP, I can move it. But the `door` rule is separate; it becomes STOP only if ""door is stop"" is active. Since that rule isn't active, the door block can be moved.

So, move up to (0,3) where the `is` rule is. Then, move right to (1,3) where the `win` rule is. Then, move down to (0,2) to get the `door` rule. Then arrange them as `door is win`.

But the problem is navigating through the walls. The walls are at (-4,3), (-4,2), etc. So from Baba's starting position at (9,-3), moving right and up would hit those walls. Maybe I need to find another path.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't needed right now, and the solution is to create a new rule. For example, ""baba is win"", which would make touching the win object make me win. To do that, I need to get the `baba` rule next to `win` and `is`.

The `baba` rule is at (9,-3). The `is` rule is at (0,3). The `win` is at (1,3). So the distance is quite big. Maybe I need to move the `is` rule to be near `baba` and `win`.

But moving the `is` rule from (0,3) to near (9,-3) would take many steps. That seems impractical.

Alternatively, focus on creating ""door is win"". If I can get the `door` block next to `win` and `is`, then touching the door would make me win. The door is at (7,-3) according to the observation? Wait, the door's position is ""7 step to the left and 3 step up"" from where? The observation lists objects relative to Baba's position? Or relative to the starting point?

This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume that all positions are relative to Baba's current position. So if the door is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up from Baba, then its position is (-7,3) if Baba is at (0,0).

Alternatively, the coordinates are absolute. But without knowing the map's layout, it's hard to visualize. Maybe the key is to find the nearest movable rule blocks and combine them to change the rules.

Given that the active rule is only ""baba is you"", I can move around. The main challenge is the door blocking the path to the win object. If I can make the door a non-STOP object, I can move through it. Or make myself a WIN object.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you"", I can turn into another object by making a rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the `baba` rule block next to `win` and `is`. But the `baba` rule is far away. Alternatively, take the `win` rule and move it next to `baba` and `is`.

But how to reach those areas? The walls are blocking the path. Maybe push the walls if they're not STOP. The walls are at 4 step left and 3 step up. If they're not STOP, I can push them aside. But to do that, I need to move towards them.

Suppose I move left from my current position towards the walls. If I can push the walls, maybe create a path. But I need to know if the walls are STOP. Since the active rules don't have ""wall is stop"", they might be pushable.

Wait, the `wall` rule is at 9 step left and 2 step up. So if I can combine `wall`, `stop`, and `is`, then walls become STOP. But that's a different goal. Maybe the key is to first make the door a win.

Alternatively, think about the `key`. If I can get the key, maybe there's a rule that involves it. But the observation doesn't mention any rules related to the key. The `key` object is just there. Maybe to unlock the door, but there's no lock mentioned.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move to the `is` rule at 3 step up to start combining rules.
2. Find the `door` rule at 2 step up and `win` at 1 right, 3 up.
3. Arrange them as `door is win` to make the door a win condition.
4. Move through the door to win.

To do this, I need to navigate to those blocks. From Baba's position (assuming at 9 left, 3 down), moving up to 3 step up would be towards the `is` rule. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 left, 3 up. So maybe I need to push the walls aside.

If the walls are not STOP, I can push them. Let's assume they're pushable. So move left towards the walls at 4 left, 3 up. But how? From Baba's position at 9 left, 3 down, moving left would decrease the x-coordinate. The walls are at 4 left, 3 up. So maybe moving left multiple times to reach them.

But the exact path isn't clear. Maybe the best action is to move up towards the `is` rule to start manipulating the rules there. Alternatively, move right towards the `win` rule.

Wait, the `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 step up from Baba's current position. So if I move right and up, maybe I can reach it. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

Baba is at (0,0) (assuming). The `win` is at (1,3). The `is` is at (0,3). The `door` is at (0,2). The `stop` is at (-7,2). The `wall` is at (-9,2). The `key` is at (-8,3).

So moving from (0,0) to (0,3) requires moving up 3 times. But there's a wall at (-4,3), (-4,2), etc. So maybe the path is blocked by walls in the middle.

Alternatively, move right to (1,0), then up to (1,3). But again, walls might be in the way.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is to first create a rule that allows me to pass through the door or walls. For example, ""wall is push"" or ""door is not stop"".

But how? Let's think. If I can make ""wall is push"", then I can push the walls aside. To do that, I need to move the `wall` rule block next to `push` and `is`. But there's no `push` block in the current objects. Only `is`, `win`, `door`, `ball`, `key`, `stop`, `baba`.

Alternatively, create ""stop is nothing"", which would remove the STOP property. But there's no `nothing` block.

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" by combining `baba`, `is`, and `win`. But `baba` is at (9,-3), which is far away.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to grab the key first. The key is at (-8,3). If I can move there, maybe it unlocks something. But how?

To get to the key at (-8,3), I need to move left 8 steps and up 3. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at (-4,3), there's a wall. So maybe I need to push the walls aside.

If the walls are not STOP, I can push them. Let's try moving left from Baba's position. Moving left once to (-1,0), then again to (-2,0), etc., until reaching the wall at (-4,0). But the wall's position is at (-4,3), which is up 3 steps. So maybe moving up first.

This is getting too vague without a visual map. Maybe the best action is to move up towards the `is` rule to start working on the rules. So the chosen action is up.

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around freely unless there's a ""stop"" property. So my goal is to get to the ""win"" condition. Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. There's also a key nearby at 8 steps left and 3 steps up, but I need to check if I can reach it.

First, I need to understand the layout. The key is to the left of where I probably am. The ""win"" object is to the right and up. But between me and the ""win"" there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, the wall is there, but since the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push or move objects that aren't ""stop."" The wall has the ""wall"" property, but the rule ""wall is you"" isn't active here. Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you."" So the walls are solid because they have the ""stop"" property? Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up."" So the stop rule is active, meaning walls or other objects defined as stop are immovable. The wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up is a wall, but the ""wall"" rule is at 9 steps left and 2 steps up. Hmm, maybe the ""wall is you"" isn't active, so the walls are just regular walls that stop me.

So, my path to the win object is blocked by a wall. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the wall if it's not a stop. Wait, no, the stop rule is separate. The stop rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. So if an object is defined as stop, like a wall, then it's immovable. Let me confirm: the wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up is a wall, and there's a ""rule `stop`"" nearby, so that wall is stop. Therefore, I can't push it.

So how to get past the wall? Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The ""is"" rules are scattered around. There's a rule `is` at 3 steps up, which is part of the active rule ""baba is you."" If I can move that ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" with another property, maybe I can change what I am.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `you` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down."" If I can make ""baba"" be ""you,"" then maybe I can interact differently. But how? To do that, I need to form a new rule ""baba is you."" Currently, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so that's already there. Wait, maybe there's another ""you"" rule that I can move. The ""rule `you`"" is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule next to ""baba,"" then maybe I can create a new rule.

But to move the ""you"" rule, I need to be able to move text blocks. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move any text blocks that aren't stop. The ""is"" rules are movable because they don't have a stop property. So if I can move the ""you"" rule next to ""baba,"" then I can create ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Wait, maybe there's another way. For example, if I can make ""you"" a different property, like ""win,"" then maybe I can reach the win object by being you. But that seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I need to change the ""win"" condition. The current ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""win"" rule to be next to a different object, like a key or Baba, then the win condition changes. For instance, if I make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make me win. But how to do that?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `win`"" at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. To change that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move the ""win"" rule if it's not stop. The ""win"" rule itself isn't stop, so I can pick it up and move it. Then, place it next to ""baba"" and another ""is"" rule to create ""baba is win."" That way, touching Baba would make me win, so I just need to get to where Baba is, which is wherever I am.

But wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""win"" rule next to that ""baba"" and an ""is"" rule, then ""baba is win"" becomes active, changing the win condition to being Baba. Then, I just need to stay in place, and the game would be won. That could work.

So the steps would be: move the ""win"" rule from its current position (1 step right, 3 steps up) to near the ""baba"" rule and an ""is"" rule. Let me check the positions. The current ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up from my position. The ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule to work with.

There are several ""is"" rules scattered: one at 3 steps up, another at 1 step up, one at 6 steps left, and others down below. Maybe I can find an ""is"" rule that's adjacent to the ""baba"" rule so I can place the ""win"" there.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" first to get closer, but the key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up, which is also blocked by the wall. So reaching the key might not be straightforward.

Another approach: since the door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up, maybe pushing the door out of the way? But the door has a ""door"" rule, and unless I can change its properties, it's probably just a regular door. If I can make ""door is push"" or something, but that requires rearranging rules.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 2 steps up. So the rule ""door is ?"" is there. If I can change that rule to make the door not a stop, then maybe I can push it. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make ""door is you,"" then touching the door would make it you, allowing me to walk through it. But that's a stretch.

Let me focus back on the initial idea. To make ""baba is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" rule. The closest ""is"" rule to the ""baba"" rule is the one at 8 steps left and 3 steps down (rule `is` 8 step to the left and 3 steps down), which is part of the existing ""baba is you"" rule.

So the plan is: move the ""win"" rule from its current position (1 step right, 3 steps up) to be next to the ""baba"" rule (9 steps left, 3 steps down) and the ""is"" rule there. But the distance is quite large. Maybe I need to move step by step.

Alternatively, look for a closer ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule at 3 steps up is part of the original ""baba is you."" If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to that ""is"" and the ""baba"" text, but the ""baba"" text is far away.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since the key is nearby, and if I can get the key, perhaps that unlocks the door. But the door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up, which is blocked by a wall. If I had the key, maybe I can use it on the door, but the key's rule is ""key is you"" or something? Not sure.

Wait, the key's rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. The rule `key` is there. So the key's property is defined by that rule. If I can make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and an ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key,"" then touching the key would make me win. But again, requires rearranging rules.

Hmm. This level is tricky. Let me try to outline possible actions:

1. Move towards the ""win"" object (1 step right, 3 steps up), but there's a wall blocking the way.
2. Move the ""win"" rule to change the win condition.
3. Move the ""you"" rule to make Baba have a different property.
4. Interact with the door or key in a way that overrides their properties.

Given that I can move text blocks (since I'm you), the most promising is option 2. Let's focus on moving the ""win"" rule.

The ""win"" rule is currently at 1 step right and 3 steps up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction. Since I'm Baba (you), I can pick up the ""win"" rule.

Assuming my current position is at the origin (0,0), the ""win"" rule is at (1,3). To move it, I need to go to (1,3) and then move it. But the path to (1,3) might be blocked. Let's see:

From my current position, moving up three steps would get me to the ""win"" rule's location. But there's a wall at (4,-3) which is 4 steps left and 3 steps up from me. Wait, no, the wall is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up from where? The observation lists objects relative to the player's position, I think. So ""key 8 step to the left and 3 step up"" means the key is at (-8, 3) if the player is at (0,0). Similarly, the wall at 4 step left and 3 step up is at (-4, 3). The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). So between me (-8,3) and the ""win"" rule (1,3), there's a wall at (-4,3), which is a stop, so I can't go through it. Therefore, I can't move directly right to get to the ""win"" rule.

So I need to find another way to reach the ""win"" rule. Maybe by moving text blocks to create a path or change the rules.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule at 3 steps up (which is part of the ""baba is you"" rule) to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down, which is (-9, -3) from me. The ""is"" rule at 8 steps left and 3 steps down is at (-8, -3). So the existing rule is ""baba is you"" formed by ""baba"" at (-9,-3), ""is"" at (-8,-3), and ""you"" at (-7,-3). If I can replace ""you"" with ""win,"" then the rule becomes ""baba is win.""

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is currently at (1,3). To get it to (-9,-3) area, that's a long distance. Maybe I can move it step by step.

First, move the ""win"" rule from (1,3) to (0,3) by moving left. But how? I need to be adjacent to it. If I move up to (1,3), then I can pick up the ""win"" rule and move it left.

But getting to (1,3) is blocked by the wall at (-4,3). So I can't move right past that wall. Unless I can push the wall, but it's a stop object.

This seems impossible. Maybe another approach: use the key to unlock the door. The door is at (-7,3). If I can push the door out of the way, but it's a stop object. Alternatively, change the door's property. The ""door"" rule is at (2,3). If I can make the door not a stop, then it becomes pushable.

For example, if I can create a rule ""door is not stop,"" but I don't have a ""not"" rule. Alternatively, change ""door is stop"" to something else. The ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the door's property might change. But the ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2), which is adjacent to the door at (-7,3). If I can move the ""stop"" rule, then the door's stop property is removed.

So steps: move the ""stop"" rule from (-7,2) to somewhere else, then the door is no longer stop, allowing me to push it. Then, move the door away from the path to the win condition.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? It's a text block, so if it's not stop, I can move it. Wait, the ""stop"" rule itself is a rule, so it's defined by ""stop is ?"". The current active rule for stop is the one at (-7,2): ""rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up."" So the stop property is coming from that rule. If I can move that rule, then the stop property is removed.

So, to move the ""stop"" rule at (-7,2), I need to be adjacent to it and move. Let's see where that is. From my position at (0,0), the ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). To get there, I need to move left 7 steps and up 2 steps. But there are walls blocking the way. The wall at (-4,3) is a stop, so I can't go through it. This path is blocked.

Alternative route: use other text blocks to create a path. For example, move some ""is"" rules to create horizontal paths. But this is getting complicated.

Maybe the key is the way. The key is at (-8,3). If I can move the key to a different location, perhaps I can use it on the door. But the door is at (-7,3), and the key is at (-8,3). If I move the key to (-7,3), I can place it in the door's position, but I don't know if that does anything.

Alternatively, if I make ""key is win,"" then picking up the key would make me win. To do that, move the ""win"" rule next to ""key"" and an ""is"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at (1,1) relative to me (assuming player is at (0,0)). The ""is"" rules are at various positions. This might be possible.

But again, the distance is an issue. The ""win"" rule is at (1,3), ""key"" is at (-8,3), so moving the ""win"" rule all the way to (-8,3) is not feasible step by step.

This level is really challenging. Let me think differently. What if I change the ""win"" condition to be Baba itself? Since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba (myself) would make me win. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-9,-3), ""is"" is at (-8,-3), and currently ""you"" is at (-7,-3). To change it to ""win,"" I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and the ""is"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). To get it to (-9,-3), that's a massive distance. Unless there's a way to move it horizontally and vertically step by step.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, move the ""win"" rule down to the area where ""baba"" is. Let's see: from (1,3), move down to (1,0), then left to (-8,0), then down to (-8,-3). But there are walls blocking this path. The wall at (-4,3) is up high, but lower down, there are walls at (-4,0), (-4,-1), etc., which might block movement.

This seems too difficult. Maybe I need to look for another rule to manipulate. The ""door"" rule is at (2,3). If I can make the door into a pushable object, I could move it out of the way. For that, I need to change the ""door"" rule. The current ""door"" rule is ""rule `door` 2 step up,"" which means the property of door is defined by that rule. If I can move that rule to change the door's property.

For example, if I make ""door is you,"" then touching the door would make it you, allowing me to walk through. But how?

To create ""door is you,"" I need to have a rule ""door is you."" The existing ""you"" rule is at (-7,-3). So if I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""door"" rule (2,3) and an ""is"" rule, that would work. The ""is"" rules are scattered, but there's one at (3,3) (rule `is` 3 step up). So from (2,3), move left to (1,3) to get to the ""is"" rule at (3,3) is not adjacent. Wait, the ""is"" rule at 3 step up is at (0,3) if the player is at (0,0). The ""door"" rule is at (2,3). So the distance is 2 steps right. To move the ""you"" rule from (-","

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means that whatever I do, I can manipulate the game rules by moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and up, a door also left and up, walls scattered around, and some rule texts. The goal is usually to reach the win condition, which is probably the door or a specific object. But I need to check the current active rules again.

The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can pick up any text blocks that aren't stopped. The rule `win` is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. Hmm, maybe I need to move that `win` rule somewhere else? Or perhaps change what defines a win.

Wait, there's a `rule 'win'` near the right side. If I can move that `win` text block to be under Baba, maybe I can make Baba the win condition. But how? To do that, I need to pick up the `win` rule and place it next to a subject, like Baba. 

Looking at the map, there's a `rule 'is'` at 3 steps up. If I can move the `win` rule next to Baba using the `is` rule, then maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win."" That way, touching Baba would make me win. 

But to do that, I need to move the `win` text block. The `win` rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So from my current position, which seems to be near the base where the `baba` rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down, I need to navigate to where the `win` rule is. 

Wait, the `key` is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up, and the `door` is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. The `win` rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from there. So, if I move right from the key's position, I can reach the `win` rule. 

But I have to make sure that the objects I'm moving aren't stopped. The walls are at various positions, but the `win` rule isn't behind a stop wall. So, moving right towards the `win` rule should be possible. 

Once I pick up the `win` rule, I need to carry it to where the `baba` rule is, which is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. But moving left from the `win` position would take me towards the left walls. Alternatively, maybe there's a better path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule by combining `baba` with `win` using an `is` block. There's an `is` rule at 3 steps up. If I can move that `is` block next to `baba` and then the `win` block, I can form ""baba is win."" 

So the steps would be: 
1. Move right to grab the `win` rule.
2. Move left towards the `baba` rule, placing the `win` after an `is` rule to create ""baba is win.""

But how to navigate without hitting walls? The path to the `win` rule is clear to the right. From the initial position, moving right multiple times should get me there. Then, moving left past the walls, but need to check the positions. 

The walls are at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, 2 steps up, etc. So moving left from the `win` position (which is 1 step right and 3 steps up) would require navigating around the walls. Maybe moving down first to avoid them? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use existing `is` rules to place the new rule. Let me think again. The active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so I can manipulate other rules. The key is to change the win condition to Baba himself. 

So, the plan is to pick up the `win` rule, then find an `is` rule to place it next to `baba` and the `win` rule. That would create ""baba is win,"" making touching Baba the win condition. 

Therefore, the next action should be to move right towards the `win` rule to pick it up. Once I have it, then move left towards the `baba` rule and place the `win` after an `is`. But since the system is turn-based, I need to output the next immediate action. 

Given that the previous actions were moving up and right, but it's failing, maybe the correct immediate step is to move right to get closer to the `win` rule. Alternatively, move up to reach the `is` rule at 3 steps up to create the new rule. 

Wait, the `is` rule is at 3 steps up. If I move up once, I can pick that up and then use it to create the new rule. But I need to also have the `win` rule. Hmm, maybe the priority is to get the `win` rule first. 

So, the immediate action should be to move right to get to the `win` rule's location. Let me check the positions again. The `win` rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from the key's position. So from where I am, moving right three times would get me there? Wait, the key is 8 steps left and 3 steps up. The `win` is 1 step right from there, so that's 7 steps left and 3 steps up. 

But my current position isn't specified, but perhaps I'm near the bottom where the `baba` rule is. To get to the `win` rule, which is up and to the right, I need to move up first, then right. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct move is to move up to reach the `is` rule at 3 steps up, then pick that up and move right to place it with `baba` and `win`. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the steps clearly:

1. **Grab the `win` rule**: It's at 1 step right and 3 steps up. To get there, move up three times and then right once. But need to avoid walls. The path seems clear as per the object positions.

2. **Grab an `is` rule**: There are `is` rules at 3 steps up and 1 step up. Maybe pick up the one at 3 steps up to create the new rule.

3. **Place the `is`, `baba`, and `win` together** to form ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition.

So the immediate action should be to move right towards the `win` rule. Hence, the next action is ""right"".

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate text blocks. My goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but maybe that's changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key to the left and up, a door also to the left and up, and walls blocking some paths. There are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered around, which are important because I can move them to create or change rules.

The ""win"" object is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a door 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which might be blocking the path. Also, there are ""wall"" rules and ""stop"" rules that make certain objects immovable. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't stopped.

Wait, the key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can get to the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door? But how? The door is a ""door"" object, and there's a ""rule `door` 2 step up."" That means normally a door is a stop unless changed. But since I can move rules, maybe I can change ""door is stop"" to something else.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up."" If I can move that ""stop"" rule away or change it, the door might become passable. Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""win"" condition to something else, like making a wall into a win, but that seems tricky.

Another approach: The ""is"" rules are key. There are multiple ""rule `is`"" blocks. If I can move one of them next to another object, I can redefine their properties. For example, if I move a ""rule `is`"" next to ""door"" and ""win,"" I could make ""door is win,"" which would let me win by stepping on the door.

But how to get there? Let's see my position. The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. The door is 7 steps left and 3 up. The ""win"" is 1 step right and 3 up. The ""rule `win`"" is already placed near there. Maybe I need to move that ""win"" rule to be under Baba?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the ""rule `win`"" block to be under me, making ""baba is win."" That would mean stepping on Baba makes me win. But how to position that?

Looking at the map, the ""rule `win`"" is 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule down to where I am, then ""baba is win"" would activate. But to move the rule, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a ""stop"" or ""wall.""

There's a wall 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which is blocking the path to the ""win"" rule. Also, the door 7 steps left and 3 up is there. But since I can push objects that aren't stopped, maybe I can push the wall or the door out of the way. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. If that's making the door a stop, then I can't push the door. But if I can remove or change the ""stop"" rule, maybe the door becomes movable.

So the plan could be: move the ""rule `stop`"" somewhere else to allow pushing the door, then push the door aside to access the ""win"" rule. Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule down to my current position.

But my current position isn't specified here. Wait, the observation lists objects relative to me? Or is this a fixed map layout? The problem is that without knowing where I am located on the grid, it's hard to determine directions. The actions are relative, like up, down, left, right, but I need to know my position relative to the objects.

Assuming that the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up is near the top of the map, and the ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down, which is probably the bottom-left corner. So the map is laid out with Baba somewhere, and objects placed around.

If I'm at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" block (9 steps left, 3 steps down), then moving up would bring me towards the other rules. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up from there. But there's a wall 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which is blocking the path. To get past the wall, I might need to push it, but it's a wall, and walls are usually stop unless rules say otherwise. Since there's a ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 2 step up,"" that defines wall's properties. If I can move that ""wall"" rule, maybe I can change what a wall is.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can push it. But how? Maybe by deleting the ""stop"" rule or changing it. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then walls wouldn't be stops anymore.

So steps could be:

1. Move the ""rule `stop`"" block to somewhere else (like next to a wall) to remove its ""stop"" property.
2. Then, push the wall 4 steps left and 3 steps up out of the way.
3. Proceed to the ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 3 steps up.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""rule `win`"" block directly to my position. The ""rule `win`"" is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So if I move right, then up, I can get to it. But there's a wall in the way. Hmm.

Another angle: The key is 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it on the door. But how does the key work in Baba Is You? Normally, a key allows you to unlock a door, but that's if the rules say ""key is unlock"" or something. There's no such rule here. The ""rule `door`"" is at 2 steps up, which might mean ""door is stop."" So unless the key changes that, the door remains a stop.

Therefore, to unlock the door, I need to change the door's rule. If I can move a ""rule `is`"" next to the door and the key, maybe make ""door is key"" or something, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, change ""door is stop"" to ""door is win,"" allowing me to win by stepping on the door.

The ""rule `door`"" is at 2 steps up. If I can move that rule next to the door and change its property, but I need to be adjacent to the rule block. Let me see the positions:

- ""rule `door`"" is at 2 step up. If I move up twice from my current position (assuming I'm at the baba rule's position), I can get to the ""rule `door`"" block. Then, by placing a ""rule `is`"" next to it, I can redefine door's property. For example, make ""door is win.""

But how to get the ""rule `is`"" blocks there. There are several ""rule `is`"" blocks scattered. One is at 3 step up, another at 1 step up and 6 step to the left, etc. Maybe I need to navigate to one of those ""is"" rules and move it next to the ""door"" rule.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, maybe I can push the ""rule `is`"" blocks. If they aren't stopped, I can move them. The ""rule `is`"" objects don't have any stop rules applied, so I can push them.

So possible steps:

1. Move right to get to the ""rule `is`"" at 6 step to the left. Wait, the ""rule `is`"" at 6 step to the left is probably along the horizontal axis. If I'm at the baba rule's position (9 left, 3 down), moving left 6 steps would reach that ""is"" rule. Then, take that ""is"" rule and move it up to where the ""door"" rule is (2 step up).

2. Once the ""is"" rule is next to the ""door"" rule, combine them to make ""door is [something]"". If I make it ""door is win"", then stepping on the door would make me win.

But how to do this in actions. Each action is a single step in a direction, but moving a rule block requires multiple steps: move towards the rule, pick it up (by moving into it?), then move it to the desired location.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline a possible path.

Assuming I'm at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" block (9 left, 3 down):

- First, move left to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 6 step to the left. From 9 left to 6 left is 3 steps left.

- Then, move up to get to the ""rule `door`"" at 2 step up. From the ""rule `is`"" at 6 left, moving up 2 steps would reach the ""door"" rule's position.

- Place the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule to create ""door is win"".

Once that's done, the door becomes a win object. Then, I can move to the door and step on it to win.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""win"" rule to be under me, that would also work. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up from the baba's position. So moving right once, then up three times would get me there. But there's a wall blocking the path.

The wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. To get past it, I need to move it. Since it's a wall with the ""rule `wall`"" at 9 left and 2 up, which defines it as a wall. If I can remove that rule or change it, the wall might become movable.

Alternatively, if I can push the wall. Since walls are usually stop, but if the ""stop"" rule is removed, they can be pushed. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then walls aren't stops anymore.

So another path:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 7 left and 2 up.

2. Move it somewhere else, like to the right, so it's no longer applying to the wall.

3. Then, push the wall at 4 left and 3 up out of the way.

4. Proceed to the ""win"" rule at 1 right and 3 up.

But navigating all this requires precise movements.

Considering the previous actions the assistant took were ""up"", ""right"", ""left"", etc., but kept getting invalid, maybe the correct approach is to focus on manipulating the rules.

Let me try to think of the immediate possible actions. The latest observation shows that after some ""up"" and ""right"" movements, the state hasn't changed much. The key is still 8 left and 3 up, door 7 left and 3 up, win 1 right and 3 up.

The critical rule here is ""baba is you"", so I can move any text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are movable. So perhaps the best move is to move a ""rule `is`"" next to the ""door"" and ""win"" to redefine the door as win.

To do that, I need to:

- Find a ""rule `is`"" block. There are several: one at 3 step up, one at 1 step up, and one at 6 step left.

- Move that ""rule `is`"" block to be adjacent to the ""door"" rule (2 step up) and the ""win"" rule (1 step right, 3 step up).

Assuming I'm at the baba's position (9 left, 3 down), let's see the positions relative to me:

- ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up: moving up 3 steps gets there.

- Then, from there, move left to reach the ""door"" rule at 7 left and 3 up. Wait, my current position after moving up 3 steps would be at 3 step up. The ""door"" is at 7 left and 3 up. If I'm at 3 step up, my x-coordinate is not specified, but assuming that the directions are relative, moving left from the ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up would take me towards the door.

This is getting a bit confusing without a map layout. Perhaps the best immediate action is to move towards a ""rule `is`"" block to start manipulating the rules. For example, moving up to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up, then left to get to the door area.

Alternatively, since the ""win"" rule is nearby, maybe moving right to get to it. But blocked by the wall. So the key is to remove the wall's stop property.

Another idea: The ""rule `wall`"" is at 9 left and 2 up. If I can move that rule, perhaps changing what a wall is. For example, move the ""wall"" rule to say ""wall is you"", making walls passable. But that requires placing the ""is"" rule next to it.

But this requires multiple steps: moving to the ""wall"" rule, then moving an ""is"" rule next to it, then changing the text.

This is quite complex. Given the time constraints, maybe the best immediate action is to move towards a ""rule `is`"" block to start manipulating. For example, moving up to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up, then left to get to the door area.

But the previous actions of ""up"" and ""right"" didn't work, perhaps because the assistant wasn't moving towards the correct objects. Let's try to compute the correct direction.

If the assistant is at the baba's position (9 left, 3 down), then:

- The ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up is 3 steps up from there.

- The ""door"" is at 7 left and 3 up. From the baba's position, that's 2 steps left and 3 steps up.

So to get to the door's rule, which is at 2 step up, the assistant needs to move up twice. But there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up, which is blocking the path. Wait, the wall is at 4 left and 3 up, which is between the baba and the door. So to get to the door's rule at 2 step up, the assistant would have to go around the wall.

Alternatively, the assistant could move the ""rule `stop`"" to remove the wall's stop property. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 7 left and 2 up. If the assistant moves right to that position, then moves the ""stop"" rule away, the wall at 4 left and 3 up might become pushable.

But this is getting too involved. Given the previous failures, maybe the simplest valid action is to move towards a ""rule `is`"" block to start manipulating. For example, moving up to reach the ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up.

So the next action should be ""up"".

Let's see. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and interact with text blocks. The goal is usually to reach a ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and 3 steps up. Then a door at the same position as the key but one step less to the left and same vertical. Wall 4 steps to the left and 3 up. There are several ""rule is"" blocks scattered around, and a ""win"" block 1 step to the right and 3 up. Also, a ""stop"" rule at 7 left, 2 up, and walls below.

I need to figure out how to reach the win condition. The key is nearby, maybe moving left or up to get it? But the door might be blocking the way. Let's check the positions again. The key is 8 left, 3 up. The door is 7 left, 3 up. So the door is one step to the right of the key. If I can push the door, but wait, can I push objects? Only if they're not ""stop."" The door is under the ""door is stop"" rule? Wait, no, the rule ""stop"" is at 7 left, 2 up. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. So the door's position isn't directly affected by the ""stop"" rule unless there's a line of sight. Maybe the door is movable unless there's a STOP property in its path.

Alternatively, maybe the key is behind the door. So to get the key, I might need to move the door out of the way. But how? If I can push the door, since it's not explicitly stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at a different location. So perhaps I can move the door by stepping next to it and pushing. Then take the key.

But first, my current position isn't clear. The observation mentions objects relative to where? Maybe I'm at the origin, and the directions are from my position. For example, ""key 8 step to the left"" would be 8 steps left from me. So to reach the key, I need to move left 8 times, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path by moving up first.

Looking at the rules, there's ""rule `is` 3 step up."" If I can move that ""is"" rule and combine it with other text blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or something. But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule together.

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 9 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. So they're quite far apart. Maybe I need to move some ""is"" rules to connect them. The ""is"" rules are at 3 up, 1 up, 6 left, etc. If I can move an ""is"" next to ""baba"" and another next to ""win"", then I can create ""baba is win"".

But how to move the ""is"" blocks? Each ""is"" is a text block that can be moved unless it's under a ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 2 up. So the ""is"" at 3 up is not stopped. The ""is"" at 1 right, 1 up is also not stopped. So perhaps I can move those.

For example, move up to reach the ""is"" at 3 step up, then take it to the ""baba"" rule at 9 left, 3 down. But the path might be blocked by walls. The walls are at 4 left, 3 up; 9 left, 2 up; etc. So moving up to the ""is"" at 3 up might be possible if there's a clear path.

Alternatively, move right to the ""win"" rule at 1 right, 3 up, and combine it with an ""is"" rule. But the ""win"" is already there; maybe the goal is to change the ""win"" condition. Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door or whatever would make me win.

So the plan is: move to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then move it next to the ""baba"" rule at 9 left, 3 down, creating ""baba is win."" Then, since I'm Baba (because ""baba is you""), touching the door or whatever would make me win.

But how to navigate there? Let's see. Current position isn't specified, but the objects are listed relative to me. So to get to the ""is"" at 3 step up, I need to move up 3 times. But between me and that ""is"" are walls? Let's check the objects. At 4 left, 3 up is a wall. So if I'm at position (0,0), the wall is at (-4,3). The ""is"" is at (0,3). So there's a wall at (-4,3), but I'm at (0,0). To move up to (0,3), I need to pass through x=0, y=1 and y=2. Are there walls there? The wall at 4 left, 2 up is at (-4,2), which is not on my path. The wall at 7 left, 2 up is (-7,2), also not in the way. So maybe the path up is clear. So move up 3 times to reach the ""is"" block.

Once there, pick up the ""is"" block and move it to the ""baba"" rule at ( -9, -3 ). Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 9 steps to the left and 3 steps down from me. So that would be (-9, -3). To get there from (0,3), I need to move left 9 and down 3. But there are walls along the way. For example, at (-4,3) there's a wall, then at (-4,2), (-4,1), etc. Also, the ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). So moving left from (0,3) to (-9,3) would hit the wall at (-4,3) and beyond. That's a problem.

Alternative approach: Maybe move the ""is"" block to the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 up. So from my position (0,0), that's (1,3). The path to (1,3) would require moving right and up. Are there walls? The wall at ( -4,3 ) is to the left, so not on the way. Moving right 1 to (1,0), then up 3 to (1,3). But the ""win"" rule is there. So if I can place an ""is"" next to ""win"", then perhaps create ""baba is win"".

But how to get the ""is"" block there. The ""is"" at (0,3) can be moved right to (1,3) by moving right twice (from (0,3) to (1,3) requires moving right once, then up? Wait, the ""is"" is at 3 step up, which is (0,3). The ""win"" is at (1,3). So if I move right from (0,3) to (1,3), that's possible if there's no wall. Looking at the objects, at (4 left, 3 up) is a wall at (-4,3), which is not on the way to (1,3). So moving right from (0,3) to (1,3) is possible. Then place the ""is"" next to ""win"".

So steps: move up 3 times to reach the ""is"" at (0,3). Then move right once to (1,3), place the ""is"" there. Now the rule would be ""win is is""? No, wait. The ""win"" is already a rule. To create ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to be adjacent to both ""baba"" and ""win"". But that's complicated. Maybe first create ""you is win"" or something else.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba (because ""baba is you""), if I can make ""win is baba"", then touching the win object would work. But how?

Alternatively, pick up the ""key"" and use it to unlock the door. The key is at ( -8, 3 ). To get there, move left 8 steps. But there's a wall at (-4,3). So that path is blocked. Unless there's another way around.

Wait, the door is at (-7,3), one step right of the key. So the key is behind the door. To get the key, need to move the door. But the door's rule is ""door is stop"" at (-7,2). So the door is stopped unless there's no ""stop"" rule affecting it. The ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2), which is below the door. So the door is stopped, meaning it can't be moved. So I can't push the door to access the key.

Hmm, tricky. So maybe the key isn't necessary. Let's focus on changing the win condition.

The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). To make ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at (-9,-3). The ""is"" rules are at (0,3), (1,3), (-6,0), etc.

Perhaps move the ""is"" from (0,3) to be next to ""baba"". So from (0,3) move left 9 steps to (-9,3), then down 3 steps to (-9,0), but that's the position of ""baba"" at (-9,-3)? Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 9 steps left and 3 steps down from me, which would be (-9,-3). So moving the ""is"" from (0,3) to (-9,-3) would require a lot of steps, and there are walls in the way.

Alternative idea: Use the ""is"" at (1,3) next to ""win"". So create ""win is is"", but that doesn't help. Maybe move another ""is"" block there. There's another ""is"" at (-6,0). How to get there?

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to move to the ""is"" at 3 step up, pick it up, and move it to the ""win"" rule at (1,3). Then place it between ""baba"" and ""win"" somehow. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at (-9,-3), and the ""win"" rule is at (1,3). If I can move an ""is"" block next to both, then ""baba is win"" would be created. But the distance is too great.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""win is you"", so touching the win object would make me win. Since I'm you, that could work. To do that, I need to create ""win is you"". The ""you"" rule is at (-7,-3). So if I can get an ""is"" next to ""win"" and ""you"", then ""win is you"" is created.

The ""win"" is at (1,3), ""you"" is at (-7,-3). The ""is"" blocks are at (0,3), (1,3), (-6,0). Maybe move the ""is"" from (1,3) to be next to ""you"" at (-7,-3). But that's a long distance.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (-6,0). Move it up to ( -6, 3 ), then right to (1,3), placing it next to ""win"" and ""you"". But this requires navigating around walls.

This seems really complex. Maybe a simpler solution: since I'm Baba (you), if I can make the door a Win by creating ""door is win"". Then pushing the door (if possible) would make me win.

The door is at (-7,3). To create ""door is win"", need ""door"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""win"" is at (1,3), ""door"" at (-7,3). The ""is"" rules are at (0,3), (1,3), (-6,0). Maybe move the ""is"" from (1,3) to be between ""door"" and ""win"". But the door and win are far apart.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from (0,3) to (-7,3), next to the door. Then create ""door is win"" by placing ""is"" between them and the win rule. But how?

This is getting too complicated. Let me think again. The immediate goal is to find a way to reach the win condition. Since the default win is probably the door or the win block. If I can change the win condition to Baba, then touching anything would work.

To make ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""baba"" is at (-9,-3), ""win"" at (1,3). The ""is"" rules are at (0,3), (1,3), (-6,0). The closest ""is"" is at (1,3). If I can move that ""is"" to (-9,-3), next to ""baba"", then place another ""is"" next to ""win"", but that's not possible.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at (0,3) to create ""baba is win"" by moving it to (-9,-3) and placing it between ""baba"" and ""win"". But the distance is too great and there are walls.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. The ""rule `is` 6 step to the left"" is at (-6,0). If I can move that ""is"" up to ( -6, 3 ), then right to (1,3) next to ""win"". Then create ""win is is"" which isn't helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, create ""you is win"" since I'm you. The ""you"" rule is at (-7,-3). So if I can make ""you is win"", then touching the win object would work. To do that, need ""you"" and ""win"" next to an ""is"" rule. The ""win"" is at (1,3), ""you"" at (-7,-3). The ""is"" rules are at (0,3), (1,3), (-6,0). Maybe move the ""is"" from (1,3) to (-7,-3) and place it between ""you"" and ""win"". But that's a long move.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" from (-6,0) up to ( -6, 3 ), then right to (1,3), placing it next to ""win"". Then create ""win is is"", which isn't helpful. Not sure.

This is really challenging. Maybe the simplest way is to move to the ""win"" block at (1,3) and see if being next to it works. But the default rule is ""baba is you"", so unless the win condition is changed, touching the win block might not work. Wait, the active rule is ""baba is you"", and there's a ""win"" block. Usually, in Baba games, if you are You and touch Win, you win. So if I can reach the ""win"" block, that should work. But in this case, the ""win"" block is at (1,3), which is 1 step right and 3 up from me. So moving right once and up three times.

But the path: from (0,0) to (1,3). Moving right to (1,0), then up to (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Are there walls in between? The walls are at (-4,3), (-4,2), (-4,1), etc. So on the way up from (1,0) to (1,3), there's no wall blocking. So maybe I can just move right then up.

But why didn't the previous actions work? The user mentioned that the assistant kept failing. Maybe because the model isn't considering the correct path.

So the correct action would be to move right once to get to (1,0), then up three times to (1,3), reaching the ""win"" block. Since I'm Baba (you), touching the win block should make me win. But why didn't that happen before? Maybe the model wasn't thinking of that path.

Alternatively, maybe the ""win"" block is not the actual win condition. Maybe it's a text block that needs to be activated by a rule. But according to the tips, the goal is usually to reach the win object, which is likely the case here.

So the plan is: move right to (1,0), then up to (1,3), touch the win block. That should work. So the actions would be: right, up, up, up.

But the previous attempts didn't work, maybe because the model was trying to move in the wrong direction or didn't consider this path.

So the correct action now is to move right once to start heading towards the win block.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The game's active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check the current rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. There's also a door 7 steps left and 3 up, and a wall 4 steps left and 3 up. There are several rules like ""rule `is`"" positioned in different directions. Hmm, the ""win"" object is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a door blocking that path, right? The door is 7 steps left and 3 up, which might be between me and the win condition.

Wait, the key is up there too. Maybe I need to get the key to unlock the door? But how? To pick up the key, I guess I have to move towards it. The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. But I'm not sure where I currently am. The observation doesn't specify my position, but the objects' positions are relative. Maybe I'm in a central position, and the key is to the upper left. 

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can move around. Let me see the rules again. There's a ""rule `win`"" 1 step to the right and 3 up, which might mean that normally touching the door or something else is the win condition, but here it's defined as a rule. Wait, no—the ""win"" object is separate. The door is probably acting as a stop because there's a ""rule `stop`"" near it. So the door is stopping me from passing through.

To reach the win object, I need to get past the door. But how? Maybe I can move the door or change the rules. Since I can move text blocks that aren't stop, maybe I can find a ""rule `is`"" and rearrange them. For example, if I can make the door a different property, like removing ""stop"" from it or changing what ""win"" is.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up. Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule near the door to create a new rule. If I can say ""door is not stop"" or ""door is win,"" that might help. But first, I need to reach those text blocks.

Alternatively, there's a key nearby. If I get the key, maybe it opens the door. But the key is 8 steps left and 3 up. To reach it, I need to move left and up. But my previous actions were right, up, left, etc., and maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me check the map again.

The ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up could be used to create a new rule. If I move that ""is"" next to the door, maybe I can change its property. For instance, if I make ""door is win,"" then touching the door would make me win. But I need to be able to move the ""is"" text block. Since ""is"" is a rule, and unless it's marked as stop, I should be able to move it.

So the plan is: move to the ""is"" rule at 3 steps up, then move it next to the door (7 steps left and 3 up) and combine it with ""door"" to create a new rule like ""door is win."" That way, touching the door would make me win. Alternatively, create ""door is not stop"" to remove the stop property.

But how to get there? The ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. From my current position, moving up three times would get me there. However, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, the wall is blocking the path up? Or is the wall's position relative to me? This is a bit confusing without knowing my exact location. Maybe the walls are surrounding certain areas, making movement tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I should first go get the key. The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. So moving left 8 times and up 3 times. But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a shorter path. Let me see the other rules. There's another ""rule `is`"" at 6 steps to the left. Maybe I can use that to create a rule nearby.

Wait, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so I can move. Let's focus on the immediate objects. The ""win"" is 1 step to the right and 3 up, but behind a door. The key is up there. If I can get the key and use it on the door, but how does the key work here? In Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors, but that's a default rule. Here, the rules are different. There's a ""rule `key`"" at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe that's part of the mechanics.

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a rule that says ""key is win,"" making the key the win condition. But I need to move the ""is"" rule to combine ""key"" and ""win.""

This is getting complicated. Let me break it down step by step:

1. Current active rule: Baba is You (I can move).
2. Goal: Reach the win object, which is behind a door that's stopping me.
3. Possible solutions:
   a. Remove the stop property from the door.
   b. Change the win condition to something else that's accessible.
   c. Use the key to unlock the door (if that's a valid action here).

To remove the stop property from the door, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away or change it. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, the door might no longer be stopping.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""door is not stop"" by combining the door with a negation. But I don't see a ""not"" rule here. The available rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" etc.

Another approach: Make Baba into something else that can override the stop. For example, ""baba is win"" would make me win just by existing. But to do that, I need to create that rule. To create a new rule, I need two text blocks: subject and property. The ""is"" rule is necessary.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" (which is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down) and then add ""win,"" I could create ""baba is win."" But how to reach those positions?

The ""baba"" rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new ones nearby.

Wait, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 9 steps left and 3 steps down, and a ""rule `you`"" at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. So ""baba is you"" is the active rule. To change that, I need to move the ""you"" rule or the ""baba"" rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""you is win,"" but that requires the ""you"" text block. The ""you"" is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move ""you"" next to ""win,"" that might work.

But this is getting too abstract. Let's think about possible immediate actions. The previous attempts were moving up, right, left, but maybe the AI got stuck. Maybe I need to move towards the ""is"" rule at 3 steps up to start creating new rules.

So, the action should be to move up towards that ""is"" rule. Each time I move up, I can get closer to it. Once I'm next to it, I can push it to a desired location to create a new rule.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and manipulate other objects. My goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case or if any rules have changed the win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key positioned 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. There's a door at 7 steps left and 3 steps up, which is probably blocking the path to the win condition. The win object is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, but there's a wall (4 steps left, 3 steps up) and a door (7 steps left, 3 steps up) blocking that way. 

I notice there are several ""is"" rules scattered around. The rule ""win"" is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, same as the door. Maybe I can move that ""win"" rule somewhere else? But wait, can I move the rules? The tips say that only objects not defined as ""STOP"" or similar can be moved. Since ""is"" is a rule, I think I can move it. 

Looking at the ""rule `is` 3 step up,"" maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to combine with another ""win"" or ""baba"" to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make me win. But how? Let's see. The ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down"" is far away. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule up closer. 

The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can pick up the key, maybe that helps? But to get the key, I need to move towards it. The current position of Baba isn't specified here, but based on the objects, maybe I'm at the same position as the ""rule `baba`"" at 9 steps left and 3 steps down? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule upwards to combine with ""baba"" or ""win.""

Another angle: The ""rule `you` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down"" could be important. If I can make ""baba is you"" and then ""you is win,"" that might make me win. But how to rearrange those rules. 

Wait, the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" so I can move. Let me check the positions of the ""is"" rules. There's one at 3 step up, another at 1 step up and 1 step to the right, and another at 6 step left. Maybe I can move the ""is"" at 3 step up down to combine with ""baba"" below. 

Looking at the ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down,"" if I can move the ""is"" rule there and make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make me win. But how to move the ""is"" rule. Each ""is"" is a text block that I can move if it's not STOP. 

So the plan could be: move the ""is"" rule from 3 step up to near the ""baba"" rule at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. Once combined, ""baba is win"" would make touching Baba win. Then I just need to reach that position. 

But how to navigate there. The path might be blocked by walls and doors. Alternatively, maybe use the key to open a door. The key is at 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move there, pick up the key, and then use it on the door at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. But to move to the key, I need to go left or up. 

Current position isn't clear, but maybe starting by moving up to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then moving it down. Alternatively, move the ""door"" rule or ""stop"" rule out of the way. 

Alternatively, change the ""stop"" property. If I can make ""stop is nothing,"" then the walls would be passable. But that requires manipulating the rules. 

Hmm. Let's try to prioritize. The main obstacle is the door blocking the win path. To open the door, I need a key. The key is nearby. So first, move to the key's location. To get there, I need to go left 8 steps and up 3. But maybe the grid is relative. Alternatively, using the existing ""is"" rules to create a new rule that allows passing through doors. 

Another idea: If I can make ""door is push,"" then I can push the door out of the way. But that requires having the ""push"" rule. 

Alternatively, since I'm ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the door by moving into it. But doors are usually STOP, so pushing them might not be possible unless the rule allows it. 

Wait, the rule ""stop"" is at 7 steps left and 2 step up. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the door, then the door wouldn't block movement. To do that, I need to break the ""stop"" rule. But how? Maybe by moving the ""stop"" text block away or combining it with another rule. 

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""stop is key"" or something, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, make ""door is you,"" which would mean the door is controllable. But that requires placing ""door is you"" somewhere. 

Wait, there's a ""rule `you` 7 step to the left and 3 steps down."" If I can move that ""you"" rule to the door's position, then ""door is you"" would make the door controllable. But how to move the ""you"" rule. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap. The key steps are:

1. Get the key to open the door.
2. Use the key on the door to remove it.
3. Move to the win position.

Or:

1. Change the win condition to something else, like making Baba itself the win condition.

Let's focus on changing the win condition. The current win is at 1 step right and 3 steps up, but it's blocked by a wall and a door. If I can move the ""win"" rule to a different location, like near Baba, then touching Baba would win. 

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" somewhere else. For example, move it to the position of Baba (9 steps left and 3 steps down). But how to move the ""win"" rule. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" I can move objects unless they're STOP. The ""win"" rule isn't STOP, so I can pick it up and move it. 

So the steps would be:

- Move up to the ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 3 step up.
- Pick it up and move it to the position of Baba (9 steps left and 3 steps down).
- Combine it with a nearby ""is"" rule to make ""baba is win.""

But the path to get there might be blocked. Let's check the path from the current position (assuming I'm near the key or the initial position). 

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule to work with. The ""rule `is` 3 step up"" is available. If I can move that ""is"" down and combine it with ""baba"" to make ""baba is win,"" that would work. 

So the plan:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up.
2. Move it down to the ""baba"" rule's position (9 steps left, 3 steps down).
3. Combine them to create ""baba is win.""
4. Then, touching Baba (myself) would make me win.

But how to move the ""is"" rule. Each move action is a single step in a direction. So I need to navigate to the ""is"" rule, pick it up, and carry it to the correct position. 

The ""is"" rule is 3 steps up from the current position (assuming the current position is where the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up). Wait, the ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 step up, and the ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. So maybe the current position is where the player is, but it's not specified. This is a bit confusing without knowing Baba's exact position. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the same position as the ""rule `baba` 9 step to the left and 3 steps down."" If that's the case, to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, I need to move up 3 steps. Let's say I move up three times to get to the ""is"" rule. Then, move that ""is"" rule down towards the ""baba"" position. 

But moving the ""is"" rule would require carrying it, which is possible since I'm ""baba is you."" Once I have the ""is"" rule, I can place it next to the ""baba"" rule to create ""baba is win."" 

After that, the win condition changes, and I just need to touch Baba (myself) to win. 

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move up three times to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 step up.
2. Pick up the ""is"" rule and move it down towards the ""baba"" rule.
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is win.""
4. Then, simply stay in place (idle) since touching Baba would make me win.

But the problem is that the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation shows that the active rule is still ""baba is you,"" and all objects are in their positions. So the immediate next action should be to move towards the ""is"" rule to start manipulating the rules. 

Given the positions, the ""is"" rule at 3 step up is directly above the ""win"" rule. So moving up once would get closer. But I need to check if there are any obstacles. The wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up might block the path, but since I'm ""baba is you,"" and unless the wall is defined as STOP, which it is (rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 2 step up), but the wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up is just a wall object, not a STOP rule. Wait, the ""STOP"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 step up. So the wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up is just a wall, which I can push or move if possible. 

But to move up, I need to see if there's a clear path. If the ""is"" rule is 3 steps up, and I'm currently below it, moving up would reach it. However, the path might be clear. 

So the first action should be to move up to get to the ""is"" rule. Once there, pick it up and move it down. But since each action is a single step, I need to sequentially move up, then maybe right or left to position the ""is"" rule. 

But given the current observation, the best immediate action is to move up towards the ""is"" rule at 3 step up. That would position me to start manipulating the rules.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The game is Baba Is You, right? So the goal is usually to get to the win condition, which is usually a flag or a door. Let me look at the active rules and the objects on the map.

First, the active rule is ""baba is you"". So whatever I can do, Baba can do. The objects here include a key, a door, several walls, and some rules like 'is', 'win', 'wall', 'stop', 'door', 'ball', 'baba', and 'you'. 

The key is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 7 steps left and 3 up. There are walls at various positions. The rule 'win' is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So maybe the door is the win condition? But how do I get past it?

Looking at the rules, there's 'door is door' up two steps, and 'wall is wall' further left. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left, 2 up. Since 'stop' means you can't push past it, but since I'm Baba and the rule is 'baba is you', maybe I can move through walls if I change the rules. Wait, but the current rules don't say I can walk through walls. The 'wall' rule is still there, so walls are solid.

The key is up there, but there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up, which is directly above the key. So to get the key, I might need to move that wall or change the rule. But the 'wall' rule is at 9 left, 2 up. Maybe I can move that 'wall' text block to somewhere else to remove the wall blocking the key?

Also, there's a 'rule `is` 3 step up'. Since 'is' is a fundamental rule, moving it might allow me to create new rules. For example, if I can make 'key is win', then picking up the key would make me win. Or maybe 'baba is win' so touching Baba makes me win. 

But how do I move the text blocks? I need to be next to them and they shouldn't be 'stop' or similar. Let me check the positions. The 'is' rule is 3 steps up. If I move up from my current position, can I reach it? The active rules are 'baba is you', so I can move around. 

Looking at the map, the key is at 8 left, 3 up, behind a wall. The door is at 7 left, 3 up. The 'win' rule is 1 right, 3 up, so next to the door. The 'wall' rule is at 9 left, 2 up. Maybe if I can move that 'wall' rule to somewhere else, like on top of the actual wall at 4 left, 3 up, then the wall would no longer be a wall. 

But to move the 'wall' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The 'wall' rule is at 9 left, 2 up. Where am I currently? The previous actions were moving right, left, up, etc., but the exact position of Baba isn't specified in the observation. Wait, the observation lists objects relative to Baba? Or is it a grid? The problem is that I don't know Baba's current position. 

Assuming that the 'rule `baba`' is at 9 left, 3 steps down. So maybe Baba is near there. But without knowing the exact position, it's tricky. Let me try to deduce. The 'rule `baba`' is at 9 left, 3 down. If I need to get to the 'is' rule at 3 step up, maybe moving up from there. But this is getting complicated. 

Alternatively, since the key is behind a wall, maybe I can push the wall if it's not 'stop'. The wall at 4 left, 3 up is a physical wall. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left, 2 up, which might be a different wall. But if I can change the 'wall' rule's position, maybe I can remove the wall blocking the key. 

Another angle: the 'door is door' rule. If I can change that to 'door is you', then stepping on the door would make me you, but that's not helpful. Or 'door is win', so the door becomes the win condition. But the 'win' rule is already next to the door. 

Wait, the current active rules are 'baba is you', so I am Baba. The 'win' rule is 1 right, 3 up. Maybe if I can move the 'win' rule to be under Baba, then touching it would make me win. But how? The 'win' rule is at 1 right, 3 up. So if I move up three steps and right one step, I can get to the 'win' rule. But there's a wall at 4 left, 3 up, which is blocking the path to the key. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, moving 'is' to make 'key is you', so picking up the key makes me you. But I need to be adjacent to the 'key' object and the 'is' rule. The 'key' is at 8 left, 3 up, and 'is' is at 3 step up. So maybe moving up to the 'is' rule and then moving it next to the key. 

But I need to know my current position. Since the observations keep changing with each action, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the 'is' rule at 3 step up, then move it next to the key or door to alter the rules. For example, moving 'is' to where the 'win' rule is, to create 'key is win' or something. 

Alternatively, since 'baba is you', maybe I can push the 'is' rule blocks to form new rules. For example, if I can get 'is' next to 'key' and 'win', then I can make 'key is win'. That way, picking up the key would make me win. 

Let me think step by step. First, I need to reach the 'is' rule at 3 step up. From the current observation, the 'is' rule is 3 steps up. If I keep moving up, I can get there. Once there, I can move the 'is' rule to the key's location. 

So the actions would be: up, up, up to reach the 'is' rule. Then, move the 'is' rule to the key's position (8 left, 3 up). But how? The key is at 8 left, 3 up, and the 'is' is at 3 step up. Assuming that moving right or left from the 'is' position can get to the key. 

Alternatively, after getting the 'is' rule, move it next to 'key' and 'win' to create 'key is win'. That would make the key the win object. Then picking it up would win the game. 

So the sequence would be: move up to the 'is' rule, then move it to the key's location, combining with 'win' to make the new rule. 

But in the current observation, the 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So if I move the 'is' rule to the key's position (8 left, 3 up), and then place it next to 'key' and 'win', I can create 'key is win'. 

However, the key is 8 steps left and 3 up, and the 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 up. So the 'key' and 'win' are adjacent horizontally. If I can place the 'is' rule between them, then the new rule would be 'key is win'. 

So the plan is: move up to the 'is' rule at 3 step up, then move right to where the key and win are. But how to do that step by step. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, maybe I can move through the walls if I change the rules. But currently, 'wall is wall', so walls are solid. Unless I can change that. 

Another thought: if I can make 'baba is win', then just touching Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 9 left, 3 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 1 right, 3 up. That's quite far. Maybe not feasible. 

Alternatively, make 'door is win'. The door is at 7 left, 3 up, and 'win' is at 1 right, 3 up. So the door and win are adjacent. If I can move the 'is' rule between them, then 'door is win' would make the door the win condition. Then I just need to reach the door. 

But the door is behind a wall at 4 left, 3 up. So unless I remove that wall, I can't get past. To remove the wall, I need to change the 'wall' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 9 left, 2 up. If I can move that 'wall' rule to somewhere else, like on top of the physical wall at 4 left, 3 up, then that wall would no longer be a wall. 

So steps: move to the 'wall' rule at 9 left, 2 up, then move it to the physical wall's position (4 left, 3 up). That would change the rule so that instead of 'wall is wall', it's '4 left 3 up is wall' or something, but by moving the 'wall' rule there, the physical wall's property would change. Wait, in Baba Is You, placing a 'wall' text block on a tile makes that tile a wall. So if the physical wall is at 4 left, 3 up, and I move the 'wall' rule there, then that tile becomes a wall (which it already is), but maybe if I overwrite it with a different rule. 

Alternatively, moving the 'stop' rule away from its position. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left, 2 up. If I can move that, maybe I can push past the walls. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to prioritize. The immediate goal is to reach the win condition. The win rule is next to the door, but the door is blocked by a wall. The key is behind another wall. So maybe getting the key first would be useful. 

To get the key: move up to the 'is' rule, then move it next to the key and 'win' to create 'key is win'. Then pick up the key to win. 

But how to navigate there. Let's assume I'm currently near the 'baba' rule at 9 left, 3 down. To reach the 'is' rule at 3 step up, I need to move up three times. Then from there, move right to reach the key's area. 

Alternatively, if I can push the 'key' to my position. But since 'key is you'? No, the current rules are 'baba is you'. To push the key, I need to be able to move objects. In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not 'stop'. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left, 2 up. So the walls at 4 left, 3 up and others might be stoppers. 

This is quite tricky without knowing Baba's exact position. Maybe the best action is to keep moving up towards the 'is' rule to manipulate it. Each time I move up, I get closer. So the next action should be 'up' to move closer to the 'is' rule at 3 step up.

I need to figure out what action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation and active rules.

The active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, Baba can interact with. The objects on the map include a key, a door, several walls, and some rules like ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""ball,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" positioned in different directions.

First, the goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case. Looking at the objects, there's a ""win"" rule positioned 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So the actual win condition might be somewhere there. But there's also a door 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which might be blocking the path.

The key is 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which is probably near the door. If I can get the key, maybe I can unlock the door. But how do I move the key? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Let me check the walls and rules. There are walls labeled as ""wall"" and ""stop."" The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up, which might be an immovable block.

Looking at the positions, the ""rule `is`"" blocks are scattered. Maybe I can rearrange them to create new rules. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""door"" and ""key,"" I could make ""door is key"" or something else to change the behavior of the door or key.

But first, I need to reach the key. To get to the key at 8 steps left and 3 steps up, I need to move left. However, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which is a ""STOP"" rule. So moving left directly might be blocked. Wait, but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" can I move through walls unless they're defined as STOP? The ""wall"" rule is at 9 steps left and 2 steps up. So maybe the walls areSTOP, but I can push them if they're not STOP. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. So that specific wall is STOP, meaning I can't pass through it.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to change what's STOP. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, then the wall might not be STOP anymore. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Since I'm Baba, can I move the ""stop"" rule? Let me check the active rules. The only active rule is ""baba is you,"" so moving other text blocks should be possible if they aren't STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, maybe I can remove the STOP property from the wall, allowing me to pass.

But how do I move the ""stop"" rule? To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The ""stop"" rule is 7 steps left and 2 steps up from my current position. Wait, where is Baba located? The observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's position, but the objects are listed with their relative positions. Maybe I need to infer Baba's position based on the rules and objects.

Assuming Baba is at the starting point, perhaps near the ""rule `baba`"" at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the ""you"" rule is associated with Baba. There's a ""rule `you`"" at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. So perhaps Baba is at that location. But without knowing exact coordinates, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the key is somewhere I can reach by moving left. The key is 8 steps left and 3 steps up. If I move left multiple times, I can get there. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up that's STOP. So moving left past that wall is blocked. Unless I can remove the STOP property from that wall.

To remove the STOP property, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from that wall. The ""stop"" rule is currently at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to another location, then the wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up might no longer be STOP. So the plan could be: move the ""stop"" rule block to a different position, then navigate through the wall to get the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Since I'm Baba (""baba is you""), I can move other text blocks unless they are STOP. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. However, if the ""stop"" rule is applied to a wall, then that wall is STOP. But the ""stop"" rule is a separate object. So maybe I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it elsewhere.

Looking at the map, there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered. If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to a different subject, like ""door"" or ""key,"" maybe I can change their properties. For example, moving ""stop"" to ""door"" would make ""door is stop,"" but that's already the case. Alternatively, moving ""stop"" to ""wall"" would reinforce it, but that's already there.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is win"" to make the key the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""win."" The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. The ""key"" is 8 steps left and 3 steps up. So that's quite far apart. Maybe moving closer by first obtaining the key.

Alternatively, focus on getting to the ""win"" position. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can reach there, maybe pressing on it makes me win. But there's a door 7 steps left and 3 steps up, which might be blocking that path. Also, the wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up is STOP.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Active rule: baba is you.
- Key is at 8 left, 3 up.
- Door at 7 left, 3 up.
- Wall at 4 left, 3 up (STOP).
- ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 2 up.
- ""win"" rule is 1 right, 3 up.

Possible actions:

1. Move left towards the key, but blocked by STOP wall.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall to remove its STOP property.
3. Create a new rule to make Baba win by, say, ""baba is win"".
4. Try to push the door if it's not STOP. But the door's rule is ""door is door"", so probably not movable unless ""door"" is defined as movable.

Wait, the ""door"" rule is at 2 step up. The actual door object is at 7 left, 3 up. If the door is defined by ""door is door"", which is default, maybe it's not movable. So pushing it wouldn't work.

Alternatively, if I can change the door's property to something else, like ""door is key"", then maybe interacting with it would give a key. But I need to rearrange the text blocks.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move text blocks, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to be under ""baba"" to make ""baba is win"". That would make touching Baba himself count as winning. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule next to Baba, that could work.

But where is Baba? The ""rule `you`"" is at 7 left, 3 down. So maybe Baba is there. To move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to Baba, I need to navigate to that area. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rules to create ""baba is win"". For example, if there's an ""is"" rule at 6 left, I can move it next to ""baba"" and ""win"". But the ""baba"" rule is at 9 left, 3 down. That's quite far.

This seems complicated. Let's try to prioritize:

First, remove the STOP property from the wall at 4 left, 3 up. To do that, move the ""stop"" rule (at 7 left, 2 up) away from that wall. If I can move the ""stop"" rule to another location, say next to a different object, then the wall's STOP property would be removed.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. From the current position, where is the ""stop"" rule? It's at 7 left, 2 up. If I move up from my current position, maybe I can reach it. But I'm not sure where I am. Alternatively, maybe I should move right towards the ""win"" rule.

Alternatively, look for nearby movable objects. The ""is"" rules are movable unless they are STOP. The ""is"" at 3 step up might be nearby. If I can pick up that ""is"" rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"".

But how to get there. The ""is"" at 3 step up is directly above the ""win"" rule. If I move up three times, I can reach that ""is"" rule. Then, move it to be between ""baba"" and ""win"".

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 9 left, 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is in the middle. Maybe moving the ""is"" from 3 step up to be next to ""baba"" (which is at 9 left, 3 down) would require moving it down and left. But that's a long distance.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: move up to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, pick it up, and then move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"". But I need to know my current position.

Alternatively, given that all previous actions have been moving up, left, right, but led to defaults, maybe the correct action is to keep moving up towards the ""win"" rule or the ""is"" rules to rearrange them.

Alternatively, the key is at 8 left, 3 up. If I could move left past the wall, but it's STOP. So removing the STOP by moving the ""stop"" rule.

To move the ""stop"" rule at 7 left, 2 up, I need to be adjacent to it. If I move left from my current position, but I'm not sure where I am. Maybe the best bet is to move left towards the key, but that's blocked. Alternatively, move up to reach the ""is"" rules and rearrange them.

Given the previous actions of moving up and right, perhaps the correct action now is to move up again to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, pick it up, and then move it to combine with ""baba"" and ""win"".

I need to figure out how to get past this door in Baba Is You. The current active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move and interact with objects. Let me look at the objects around me.

First, there's a key located 8 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The door is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. So, the door is one step closer to me than the key. But getting the key might be necessary because the door is probably locked. But how do I know if the door needs a key? Well, in many puzzles, a door with a key nearby implies that the key opens it. But in Baba Is You, the rules might be different. I need to check if there's a rule that connects the key and the door.

Looking at the active rules, the main rule is ""baba is you."" There are other rules like ""win"" next to the right direction, ""wall"" which is a stop rule, and ""stop"" which makes objects immovable. Also, there are multiple ""is"" rules scattered around. The key is 1 step to the right and 1 step down from the key rule. Wait, the rule `key` is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I can move that rule to change the key's property?

If I can move the ""key"" rule, perhaps I can make the key a different property, like ""win"" or something else. For example, if I move the ""key is you"" rule, then grabbing the key would make me you, but right now, ""baba is you."" Alternatively, if I can make the door a ""win"" instead of a ""stop,"" then standing on the door would make me win. But how?

Let me see the positions again. The rule `win` is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. The door is 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. Maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to the door's location. But to do that, I need to push the ""win"" rule block. However, the path might be blocked by walls or stop rules. The wall is at 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which is between me and the ""win"" rule. So moving right to get to the ""win"" rule is blocked by the wall. Unless I can change the wall's rule to not be a stop.

Looking at the rules, there's a ""wall is stop"" rule at 8 steps to the left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall might become movable. But moving that rule would require being next to it. The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up and 8 steps to the left. My current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm near the bottom where Baba is, I need to navigate through the objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing ""is"" rules to create new rules. There are multiple ""is"" blocks scattered. For instance, there's an ""is"" block at 1 step up and 1 step to the right. If I can move that ""is"" block next to the door, I could create a new rule like ""door is win."" That would make the door a win condition. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to both the ""is"" block and the door.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba a ""win"" by moving the ""baba is"" rule. There's a ""baba"" rule at 9 steps to the left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" rule next to an ""is"" block, I could say ""baba is win,"" making me win immediately. But how do I get to that ""baba"" rule? It's quite far down, and there are walls blocking the path.

Another angle: the key is nearby. If I can pick up the key, maybe I can use it to unlock the door. But in Baba Is You, usually, you need to move the key rule to the door's rule. For example, if there's a ""key is win"" rule, then stepping on the key would make you win. But currently, the key is just a key. So maybe moving the ""key"" rule next to the ""door"" rule and an ""is"" rule could create a ""door is key"" rule, but that wouldn't help. Alternatively, making the door a ""push"" or ""win"" rule.

Wait, the door is currently a stop because of the ""wall is stop"" and ""door is [something]"". Let me check the active rules. The ""door"" rule is at 2 steps up. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. So the door is under a stop rule? Maybe not. The rules are separate. So the door is an object, and there's a ""stop"" rule elsewhere. To make the door passable, I need to remove the ""stop"" rule or change the door's property.

Alternatively, if I can make the door a ""win"" by attaching the ""win"" rule to it. There's a ""win"" rule at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""win"" rule next to the door and an ""is"" rule, then ""door is win"" would be created. But how to reach that?

The problem is that the path to the ""win"" rule is blocked by walls. The wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up is a stop, so I can't push past it. Unless I can change the wall's rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 8 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, then the wall might become movable. But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. But where am I located? The observation doesn't specify Baba's position, but the key, door, and other objects are positioned relative to Baba.

Assuming Baba is near the lower part, near the ""baba"" rule at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. To get to the ""stop"" rule at 8 left and 2 up, I might need to navigate through the walls. But the walls are stops, so I can't move through them. This seems tricky.

Another approach: use the existing ""is"" rules. There's an ""is"" rule at 1 step up and 1 step right. If I can move that ""is"" next to the door and the ""win"" rule, I could create ""door is win."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block. Let's see where the ""is"" block is. It's at 1 step up and 1 step right. If I move up to that ""is"" block, then right to get to the ""win"" rule, and then place the ""is"" next to the door. But the door is at 7 left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. So the door is to the left of the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""is"" block between the ""win"" and the door, then create ""door is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" block. If I'm adjacent to it, I can push it. Let's say I move right to the ""is"" block at 1 step up and 1 step right, then move up to the ""win"" rule, then move left to position the ""is"" next to the door. However, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which is between me and the ""win"" rule. So I can't get past that wall unless I make it movable.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push objects. For example, the ""is"" blocks can be pushed if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up, which might stop some movement. But if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the walls might become movable.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the door a ""you"" by creating a ""door is you"" rule. Then stepping on the door would make me you, but I'm already you. That doesn't help. Alternatively, making Baba a ""win"" by moving the ""baba"" rule next to an ""is"" and ""win"" rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at 9 left and 3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. The ""is"" rules are scattered. If I can move the ""baba"" rule up and right to align with an ""is"" and ""win"" rule, then ""baba is win"" would be created, making me win. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rule at 3 steps up. There's an ""is"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""baba"" rule and the ""win"" rule, then ""baba is win"" would be formed. But again, the path is blocked by walls.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 3 steps up is right above the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So if I can move the ""is"" from 3 steps up to be next to the ""baba"" rule (which is 9 left and 3 down), that's too far. Not feasible.

Perhaps the key is the way forward. If I can get the key, then use it to unlock the door. But how? In standard puzzles, you need to move the key to the door and then the door opens. In Baba Is You, you might need to create a ""key is door"" rule or something. But the key's rule is separate. The ""key"" rule is at 2 right and 1 down. If I can move that ""key"" rule to the door's position, then maybe the door becomes a key. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, make the key a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to the key. There's a ""win"" rule at 1 right and 3 up. If I can move that ""win"" rule down to the key's location, then ""key is win"" would be created. Then stepping on the key would make me win. But the key is at 8 left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. So moving the ""win"" rule left 9 steps? That's impossible without passing through walls.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think differently. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push text blocks. The goal is to reach the door, which is a stop, but if I can change its rule to ""win,"" then stepping on it would win. To change the door's rule, I need to create a ""door is win"" rule. To do that, I need an ""is"" block next to both the door and the ""win"" block.

The ""win"" block is at 1 right and 3 up. The door is at 7 left and 3 up. The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. The closest ""is"" block is at 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" block from 3 steps up to be next to the door and the ""win"" block, that would work. But how to move it there?

The ""is"" block at 3 steps up is directly above the ""win"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" block leftwards, past the wall at 4 left and 3 up. But the wall is a stop, so I can't push it. Unless I remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 8 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall might become movable.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""stop"" rule is at 8 left and 2 up. My current position is unknown, but assuming I'm near the bottom, maybe I can navigate to that area. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, the wall at 4 left and 3 up is a stop, and the wall at 9 left and 2 up is part of the structure.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe another approach: use the ""you"" rule. There's a ""you"" rule at 7 left and 3 down. If I can make Baba the ""you"" by moving that rule onto Baba, but ""baba is you"" is already active. Alternatively, create a ""baba is you"" rule elsewhere, but it's already there.

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 7 left and 3 down. If I can push that ""you"" rule onto Baba, then maybe double the ""you"" property. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, make the door a ""you"" so stepping on it makes me you, but I'm already you. That doesn't help.

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to the door. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. The door is at 7 left and 3 up. To move the ""win"" rule left 8 steps? That's a lot, and there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to their advantage. There's an ""is"" rule at 6 left. If I can move that ""is"" next to the door and the ""win"" rule, but the positions are too far apart.

Wait, the ""is"" rule at 6 left is vertically aligned. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. The door is at 7 left and 3 up. So the door and win are 8 steps apart left-right. The ""is"" at 6 left is between them. If I can move the ""is"" from 6 left to be next to the door and the ""win"" rule. For example, move the ""is"" up to 3 steps up, then left to the door. But again, blocked by walls.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to focus on the key. If I can get the key, then maybe the door opens when I have it. To get the key, I need to move the ""key"" rule to the key's position. The ""key"" rule is at 2 right and 1 down. The actual key is at 8 left and 3 up. So I need to move the ""key"" rule from 2 right 1 down to 8 left 3 up. That's a big move, but perhaps possible by pushing it past the obstacles.

To move the ""key"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""key"" rule is at 2 right and 1 down. If I move right to get next to it, then push it left. But the path might be blocked by walls. There's a wall at 4 left and 3 up, but the ""key"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the key's position. Maybe I can navigate around the walls by moving up or down first.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rules to create a path. For example, if I can make certain walls passable by removing their ""stop"" property.

But I'm running out of ideas. Maybe the simplest solution I can think of is to move the ""win"" rule next to the door by pushing it left. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. To move it left, I need to be adjacent to it and push left. However, there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up, which is a stop. So unless I can move that wall, I can't push the ""win"" rule past it.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 8 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule down, then the wall at 4 left and 3 up might become passable. To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""stop"" rule is at 8 left and 2 up. If I can get there by moving up and left, but there are other walls blocking the path.

This seems too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ""win"" rule to the door by rearranging the ""is"" blocks. Let me try to visualize the grid based on the positions:

- The ""win"" rule is at (x=+1, y=+3).
- The door is at (x=-7, y=+3).
- The ""is"" rule at (x=0, y=+3) is directly above the ""win"" rule.
- There's an ""is"" rule at (x=-6, y=0).
- The ""baba"" rule is at (x=-9, y=-3).

Assuming Baba is at the starting position, perhaps near the bottom right. To move the ""win"" rule to the door, I need to move the ""is"" block at (0,3) leftwards and down to position it between the ""win"" and the door. But how?

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at (x=-6, y=0). If I can move that ""is"" block up to (x=-7, y=+3) next to the door and the ""win"" rule. But that requires moving it up 3 steps and left 1 step, which might be possible if the path is clear.

But there's a wall at (x=-4, y=+3), which is a stop. So moving left from (x=-6, y=0) to (x=-7, y=0) is possible if there's no wall. But the wall at (x=-4, y=+3) is up, not in the same horizontal line.

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to make the door a ""stop"" rule somewhere else, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, make the door a ""push"" rule so I can push it aside, but there's no ""door is push"" rule active.

Wait, the door is currently under the ""stop"" rule, making it immovable. If I can remove the ""stop"" rule from the door, then it becomes movable. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the door. The ""stop"" rule is at (x=-7, y=+2). If I can move that ""stop"" rule down to (x=-7, y=+3), then the door's ""stop"" property is removed. But the door is at (x=-7, y=+3), so moving the ""stop"" rule there would make ""door is stop"" active, which is worse. Hmm,","

Let's see. I need to figure out the best move here in Baba Is You. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and potentially push things.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and up, a door also left and up, walls everywhere, and some rules like ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" and ""stop."" The goal is usually to reach the win condition, which is probably the door or a specific object. But I need to check the current active rules.

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"" right now. So all other rules like ""win"" might not be active unless I change them. The ""win"" rule is positioned 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If I can get to that rule and perhaps move it or combine it with something else, maybe I can make ""baba is win"" or change the win condition.

But how? The key is to the left and up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something? Or maybe the door is the win condition. But the door is blocked by walls and ""stop"" properties. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. Since I'm Baba and I can move, but if I push a STOP object, does that work? Wait, the rules don't mention that I can push STOP objects unless they're not defined as stop. Wait, the active rules only have ""baba is you,"" so other properties like STOP might still affect movement. So if there's a wall or stop, I can't push through them unless there's a rule allowing it.

Looking at the map, the key is at 8 steps left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up. The ""is"" rules are scattered. Maybe I need to move those ""is"" rules next to the ""win"" and ""baba"" to create a new rule like ""baba is win.""

For example, if I can move the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps up (rule `is` 3 step up) to be next to the ""win"" rule, then I could make ""baba is win"" by combining them. But how to do that? To move an ""is"" rule, I have to be adjacent to it and it shouldn't be a STOP. Let's check the positions.

The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is right above the door (door is at 7 left, 3 up). The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 up, so that's 8 left, 3 up (since the key is 8 left, 3 up). Wait, the key is 8 left and 3 up, and the ""win"" rule is 1 step right from that, so 7 left, 3 up? Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again.

The key is 8 step to the left and 3 step up. So if I'm at the starting position (probably origin), the key is at (-8, 3). The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 step up from the key, so that would be (-7, 3). The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is directly above whatever is at the same left coordinate. Wait, maybe the positions are relative to Baba's current location. But the problem is that without knowing Baba's exact position, it's a bit tricky. The observations list the positions relative to Baba, I think.

Assuming that the ""is"" rule at 3 step up is positioned such that moving up from Baba's current position 3 steps lands me there. Similarly, the ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So, if I move up three times, I can get to that ""is"" rule. Then, from there, move right once to reach the ""win"" rule. But to do that, I need to navigate past any obstacles.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which is blocking the path up from Baba's position. Also, the ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up, which might be a wall that stops movement. So moving up directly might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a text block. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't STOP. The ""is"" rules are likely movable unless they're under a STOP rule. Checking the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up, which is a different position than the ""is"" rules. So the ""is"" rules at 3 step up and others might be movable.

So the plan is: move towards the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then move right to the ""win"" rule, and combine them to make ""baba is win."" But how to get there?

Current position of Baba: Let's assume the starting position is at (0,0). The key is at (-8,3), door at (-7,3), wall at (-4,3). The ""is"" rule is at (0,3) because it's 3 steps up from Baba. Wait, no—the description says ""rule `is` 3 step up."" If Baba is at (0,0), then 3 steps up would be (0,3). So the ""is"" rule is at (0,3). The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, which would be (1,3). So to get from Baba's position (0,0) to (0,3), I need to move up three times. But between (0,0) and (0,3), there's a wall at (-4,3) which is 4 steps left and 3 up. Wait, no—the wall is at 4 steps left and 3 up from Baba. So if Baba is at (0,0), the wall is at (-4,3). That's to the left and up. So moving up from Baba's position, the first step up would be (0,1), but there's a wall at (-4,3), which is not in the same column. So maybe the path up is clear except for the wall at (-4,3), which is to the left. So moving up from Baba's position, going to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) should be possible if there are no walls in between. But the wall at (-4,3) is to the left, so that's not blocking the upward path.

Wait, maybe the walls are spread out. Let me list all walls:

- wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up: (-4,3)
- wall 4 step to the left and 2 step up: (-4,2)
- wall 4 step to the left and 1 step up: (-4,1)
- wall 4 step to the left: (-4,0)
- wall 4 step to the left and 1 step down: (-4,-1)
- wall 4 step to the left and 2 steps down: (-4,-2)
- wall 4 step to the left and 3 steps down: (-4,-3)

So all walls are at x=-4, y from 0 to 3 and down to -3. So the upward path from Baba's position (0,0) to (0,3) is clear except for the wall at (-4,3), which is to the left. So moving up should be possible.

So the steps could be:

1. Move up three times to reach (0,3), where the ""is"" rule is.
2. Then move right to (1,3) to reach the ""win"" rule.
3. Combine them to create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"".

But how to get to the ""baba"" rule? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's (-9,-3). That seems far. Alternatively, maybe there's a nearby ""baba"" text block.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 9 left and 3 down. So that's quite far. Alternatively, maybe the ""baba"" that I control is considered as a text block? Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the player-controlled Baba is separate from the text blocks. The text blocks that say ""BABA IS YOU"" are separate objects. So to create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" I need to have the ""baba"" text block adjacent to the ""win"" and ""is"" text blocks.

But the ""baba"" text block is located at (-9,-3), which is far from where I am. So moving there would take a lot of steps left and down, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. The ""you"" rule is at 7 left and 3 down. If I can make myself ""win"" instead of ""you,"" that might work. But how?

Another approach: The ""win"" rule is currently separate. If I can move the ""is"" rule next to it and the ""baba"" text block, then I can create ""baba is win."" But the ""baba"" text block is far away. Unless there's a way to move it.

Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 9 left and 3 down. To reach that, I would have to move left 9 times and down 3 times, but there are walls at x=-4 in various y positions. That path is blocked by walls at x=-4, so I can't go that way.

Hmm. Maybe I need to use the key. The key is at 8 left and 3 up, which is (-8,3). If I can get the key, maybe it opens the door. The door is at (-7,3), which is 1 step right from the key. So if I have the key, I can move the door rule? Wait, the door's rule is ""rule `door` 2 step up,"" which is at (-2,3) if Baba is at (0,0). Wait, no. The ""door"" rule is at 2 step up, so (0,2). But the door object is at 7 left and 3 up, which is (-7,3). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the positions are relative to Baba's location.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is near the door, and having the key allows me to push the door or override its stop property. But since the active rule is ""baba is you,"" and the door has a ""stop"" rule, I can't push it unless I change the ""stop"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up, which is (-7,2). If I can remove or move the ""stop"" rule, then the door might become pushable. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""stop is nothing"" or ""stop is you,"" which would make the stop property irrelevant. For example, if I can make ""stop is you,"" then since I'm you, the stop wouldn't apply to me. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""stop"" and ""you.""

The ""you"" rule is at 7 left and 3 down, which is (-7,-3). The ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2). The ""is"" rules are at various positions. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, let's focus on the immediate goal. The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). If I can get the ""is"" rule next to it, then I can create ""win is something,"" but I need to make ""baba is win.""

Wait, the existing ""win"" rule is ""rule `win` 1 step to the right and 3 step up,"" which is at (1,3) if Baba is at (0,0). The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is at (0,3). So if I move right from (0,3) to (1,3), I can place the ""is"" next to ""win,"" making ""win is [something]"". But I need to specify what ""something"" is. To make ""baba is win,"" I need the ""baba"" text block next to it.

But the ""baba"" text block is far away. Unless there's a way to move it. Alternatively, maybe there's a nearby ""baba"" object that I can use. Wait, in the objects list, there's ""rule `baba`"" at 9 left and 3 down, which is (-9,-3). That's too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""is"" rule to the left and combine it with the ""win"" rule and the ""baba"" rule somehow. But without the ""baba"" nearby, it's hard.

Wait, another idea: The ""you"" rule is at 7 left and 3 down. If I can make ""you"" into ""win,"" then since I'm you, I would be win. So creating ""you is win"" would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""you"" and ""win.""

The ""you"" rule is at (-7,-3), and the ""win"" rule is at (1,3). That's a distance of 8 left and 6 up. Not nearby. But maybe there's a way to rearrange these rules.

Alternatively, let's think step by step. My current position is probably at (0,0). The ""is"" rule is at (0,3). If I move up three times, I can get there. Then move right to (1,3) where the ""win"" rule is. Then, if I can get an ""is"" next to both ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create the rule.

But where is the ""baba"" rule? At (-9,-3). That's too far. Unless there's a different ""baba"" object. Wait, in the objects list, there's the ""rule `baba`"" at 9 left and 3 down, which is the text block. The actual Baba I'm controlling is a separate object, but in terms of rules, I can manipulate the text blocks.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to focus on the immediate area. The ""is"" rule at (0,3) and the ""win"" at (1,3). If I move the ""is"" from (0,3) to (1,3), adjacent to ""win,"" then the rule would be ""win is [something]"". But I need to specify what's after ""is."" Since there's nothing there, maybe I can push the ""is"" next to ""win"" and then add another text block, but I don't have that.

Alternatively, if I can push the ""is"" rule to the left and combine it with the ""baba"" rule, which is far away. Not feasible.

Wait, maybe there's another ""is"" rule nearby. The objects list shows ""rule `is` 1 step up"" and ""rule `is` 6 step to the left."" The ""rule `is` 6 step to the left"" would be at (-6,0), assuming step left is x decreasing. The ""rule `is` 1 step up"" is at (0,1).

If I can move one of these ""is"" rules near the ""win"" and ""baba,"" that could help. For example, moving the ""is"" at (0,1) up to (0,2), then to (0,3), then right to (1,3) next to ""win."" Then, if there's a ""baba"" nearby, I can make the rule. But the nearest ""baba"" is the text block at (-9,-3), which is too far.

Alternatively, maybe the key is useful. The key is at (-8,3). If I can get the key and bring it to the door, which is at (-7,3), then maybe the door becomes win when unlocked. But I don't know the rules for keys in this level. Usually, a key opens a door, but here the rules might be different. If the rule is ""key is push"" or something, but currently, the only active rule is ""baba is you.""

So perhaps I need to create a rule like ""key is win"" or ""door is win."" But to do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push rule blocks. For example, move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule to make ""door is win."" If I can do that, then stepping on the door would make me win.

The ""door"" rule is at 2 step up, which is (0,2). The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). The ""is"" rule at (0,3). So maybe move the ""is"" from (0,3) to (0,2), adjacent to ""door"" at (0,2), making ""door is [something]."" Then place the ""win"" next to it. But the ""win"" is at (1,3), which is down and right from ""door.""

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to focus on getting to the ""win"" rule and an ""is"" rule nearby to create ""baba is win."" But without the ""baba"" text block nearby, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the ""baba"" I'm controlling is considered a text block? No, in Baba Is You, the player's character is separate, but you can push text blocks. So the text block ""BABA IS YOU"" is a separate object that I can move.

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 9 left and 3 down. So that's the text block ""BABA"". To create ""baba is win,"" I need to have ""BABA"" next to ""WIN"" and ""IS"".

The ""BABA"" text block is at (-9,-3), ""WIN"" is at (1,3), and ""IS"" is at (0,3). The distance is huge, but maybe there's a way to move them closer.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ""baba"" rule and an ""is"" rule. But that would require moving the ""win"" rule, which is possible if I can push it. Since ""baba is you,"" and the ""win"" rule is a text block, I can push it if it's not stopped by a ""stop"" rule. Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at (-7,2),","

Let's see. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", which means I can move and interact with other objects. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" condition, which in this case is probably the door. But I need to check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects: there's a key 8 steps to the left and 3 up, a door 7 steps left and 3 up, and walls in various positions. There are also several rule blocks like ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""door"", etc. 

First, I need to figure out the positions of these elements relative to me. Since the active rule is ""baba is you"", I can move freely unless there's a ""stop"" property. The walls are marked as ""stop"", so if I try to move into them, I can't. 

The door is at 7 steps left and 3 up from my current position. To reach it, I might need to go up and left. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. That's a problem because the wall has ""stop"" as a property. So I can't push past it. Wait, but maybe I can change the rules to make the wall movable. 

There's a ""rule `is`"" block 3 steps up. If I can move that ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule, I could redefine what ""wall"" means. For example, if I make ""wall is stop"", but since ""stop"" is already a property, maybe changing it to something else. Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing"", that might help. 

But first, I need to reach the ""is"" blocks. Let me check their positions. The ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up is directly above the door and key. The other ""is"" blocks are at 1 step up and 6 steps to the left. To get to the one at 3 steps up, I can move up three times. But moving up from my current position would take me towards the door and key. However, the wall at 4 steps left and 3 up is blocking that path. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to move the ""is"" block. Since ""baba is you"", I can push objects that aren't ""stop"". The ""rule `is`"" blocks aren't labeled as stop, so I can move them. If I move the ""is"" block that's 3 steps up next to the ""wall"" rule (9 steps left and 2 steps up), I could rewrite the ""wall"" property. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""stop is nothing"", making walls passable. 

But how to get there? Let me map the positions. The ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps up is above the current ""win"" rule (1 step right and 3 up). To reach that ""is"" block, I need to move up three times. However, the wall at 4 steps left and 3 up is in the way. Since the wall is a ""stop"", I can't push past it. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules first. 

Alternatively, there's another ""is"" block at 1 step up. If I can move that one closer to the ""wall"" rule, maybe that would work. Let's see. The ""rule `is`"" at 1 step up is 1 step up from my current position. If I move up once to get there, then I can perhaps push it around. But again, the walls around might block movement. 

Another approach: The key is at 8 steps left and 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe that allows me to unlock the door. But the door is at 7 steps left and 3 up, which is adjacent to the key. However, the path between them is blocked by the wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. So without removing the wall, I can't reach the key or the door. 

So the key is probably a red herring here, or maybe obtaining it isn't necessary. The main obstacle is the wall labeled ""stop"". To remove it, I need to alter the ""wall"" rule. 

Looking at the rules: ""rule `wall` 9 step to the left and 2 step up"" – this is the definition of ""wall"" as ""stop"". If I can replace this rule, maybe by moving the ""is"" block next to it, I can change what ""wall"" means. 

So the plan is: move to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up, then push it next to the ""wall"" rule to rewrite it. But how to get there? The path is blocked by the wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I need to move that wall first. But since it's a ""stop"", I can't push it. Unless I change its property. 

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Identify the positions of all relevant objects and rules.
2. Determine which rules can be manipulated to achieve movement.
3. Decide on the sequence of moving text blocks to change the necessary rules.

Current active rule: ""baba is you"" – so I can move and push non-stop objects.

Available ""is"" blocks: at 3 steps up, 1 step up, and 6 steps to the left.

The ""wall"" rule is at 9 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" block from 3 steps up to be adjacent to this ""wall"" rule, I can rewrite it. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""stop is [something else]"".

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block at 3 steps up. Let's see the path. From my current position, moving up three times would take me to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up. But between me and that block, there's the wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. Since I can't pass through ""stop"" objects, I need to move that wall out of the way. But I can't push it because it's a stop. 

Alternative idea: Maybe use another rule to change the wall's property. For instance, if I can create a rule that says ""wall is you"", then perhaps I can push the wall. But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules. 

Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe not immediately useful. 

Another angle: The ""rule `door`"" is at 2 steps up. If I can change the ""door"" rule to be ""win"", then the door would become the win condition. But the current ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba"" be ""win"", that would work. But there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. Maybe moving that ""baba"" rule next to an ""is"" block to redefine it. 

This is tricky. Let's recap:

- Need to reach the ""win"" condition, likely the door.
- Blocked by a ""stop"" wall.
- Need to change the ""wall"" rule to remove ""stop"" property.
- To do that, need to move an ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up.
2. Push it next to the ""wall"" rule (9 left, 2 up).

But how to get to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up?

Current position: Not specified, but the objects are listed relative to me. Let's assume I'm somewhere in the grid. The key and door are to the left and up. The ""is"" block at 3 steps up is directly above the ""win"" rule. To reach it, I need to move up three times. However, the wall at 4 left, 3 up is in the way. 

Since I can't pass through the wall, I need to move it. But I can't because it's a stop. So maybe I need to use another rule to change the wall's property first. For example, if I can make the wall ""push"" instead of ""stop"", then I could move it out of the way. 

To change the wall's property, I need to edit the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 9 left, 2 up. If I can move an ""is"" block next to it and change its text. 

So the plan is:

- Move to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up.
- Push it to the position adjacent to the ""wall"" rule (9 left, 2 up).
- Change the ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove ""stop"".

But how to move the ""is"" block there? Let's see the positions. The ""is"" block at 3 steps up is at (assuming my position is 0,0), maybe at (0,3). The ""wall"" rule is at (-9, 2). The distance is quite far. Maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 1 step up. If I move up once to get there, then perhaps push it towards the ""wall"" rule. But again, the walls around might block movement. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: Since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push the ""is"" block that's 3 steps up towards the ""wall"" rule. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the ""is"" block. 

Let's say I'm at position (0,0). The ""is"" block at 3 steps up is at (0,3). To get there, I need to move up three times: up, up, up. But between (0,0) and (0,3), there's a wall at (-4,3). So I can't move straight up. 

Therefore, I need to find a way around the wall. Maybe move left or right to get around it. But the wall at (-4,3) is a horizontal wall? Or is it positioned such that it's blocking the upward path? 

Assuming the walls are in specific positions, maybe I can move left or right to bypass them. For example, if I move left around the wall, then up, then right. But the observation doesn't specify the exact grid layout, just relative positions. 

This is challenging without a visual. Let's try to think differently. The key objects are the ""is"" blocks and the ""wall"" rule. If I can move an ""is"" next to the ""wall"" rule, I can change its definition. 

The ""wall"" rule is at 9 left and 2 up. The ""is"" block at 3 steps up is at (0,3). The distance between them is quite large. Maybe there's another ""is"" block closer. The ""is"" at 1 step up is at (0,1). The ""is"" at 6 left is at (-6,0). 

If I can get to the ""is"" at 1 step up (0,1), then move it towards the ""wall"" rule at (-9,2). But again, the path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" at 6 left (-6,0). Moving that to near the ""wall"" rule. But that's even further left. 

This seems impossible. Maybe there's another rule I can manipulate. For example, the ""door"" rule is at 2 steps up. If I can make the door be ""win"", then reaching the door would win the level. 

To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to the ""door"" rule and change its property. The ""door"" rule is at (0,2) if my position is (0,0). The ""is"" blocks are at (0,3), (0,1), and (-6,0). 

Moving the ""is"" at (0,3) down to (0,2) next to the ""door"" rule. Then changing ""door is [something]"" to ""win"". For example, ""door is win"". 

But the current ""win"" rule is at (1,3). If I can move the ""is"" block from (0,3) to (0,2) next to the ""door"" rule, then rewrite ""door is win"". That would make the door the win condition. Then I can push the door (if it's movable) or just stand next to it. 

But the door's current rule is ""door is [not specified]""? Wait, the observation shows ""rule `door` 2 step up"", which means the door's property is defined by that rule. The exact property isn't clear, but if I can change it to ""win"", then touching the door would win. 

So steps:

1. Move to the ""is"" block at 3 steps up (0,3).
2. Move down to (0,2) to be next to the ""door"" rule (0,2).
3. Push the ""is"" block to (0,2) adjacent to ""door"".
4. Rewrite the rule to ""door is win"".
5. Now, standing near the door (which is now a win) would complete the level.

But how to move the ""is"" block from (0,3) to (0,2)? I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at (0,2), I can push the ""is"" block down. But I'm currently at (0,0). So I need to move up to (0,1), then (0,2), then push the ""is"" from (0,3) to (0,2). 

But the path from (0,0) to (0,3) is blocked by the wall at (-4,3). So I need to find another route. Maybe move left around the wall. 

Assuming the wall at (-4,3) is a vertical wall blocking the upward path, I could move left to (-1,0), then up to (-1,3), then right to (0,3). But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, the wall at (-4,3) might be a horizontal wall, blocking movement left or right at that y-coordinate. 

This is getting too ambiguous without a visual grid. Maybe the best bet is to try moving towards the ""is"" block at 3 steps up, even if blocked, and see if the system allows it. 

But since I can't pass through ""stop"" objects, I need to find another way. Perhaps move the ""stop"" wall by redefining it. 

If I can change the ""wall"" rule from ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", then the wall would become movable. Then I could push it out of the way. 

To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule (9 left, 2 up). Let's calculate the distance. If my position is (0,0), the ""wall"" rule is at (-9,2). The ""is"" block at 3 steps up is at (0,3). The distance is quite large, but maybe there's a way to maneuver. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 1 step up (0,1). Move it towards the ""wall"" rule. But again, pathfinding is an issue. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe the intended solution is to move the ""win"" rule to be next to the door. For example, if the door is at 7 left and 3 up, and the ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up, perhaps moving the ""win"" rule left to be adjacent to the door. 

The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). The door is at (-7,3). To move the ""win"" rule to (-7,3), I need to push it left seven steps. But that's a lot, and there might be walls in the way. 

Alternatively, if I can make the door be the win condition by redefining it. 

Another approach: Since ""baba is you"", maybe touching the door is enough if it's defined as win. But the current active rule is ""baba is you"", and the door's rule is ""rule `door` 2 step up"", which might mean door is a separate object. Unless there's a rule that says ""door is win"", which there isn't in the current active rules. 

Wait, the active rules are only ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""win"", ""wall"", etc., are part of the level's static rules, but they can be manipulated by moving text blocks. 

So the key is to change the definition of ""win"" to be the door. For that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to the door and rewrite it. 

The ""win"" rule is at (1,3), and the door is at (-7,3). The distance is eight steps left. To move the ""win"" rule left, I need to push it past any ""stop"" objects. But the path might be blocked. 

Alternatively, move the door next to the ""win"" rule. But the door is an object, not a text block, so I can't move it unless it's defined as movable. Since the default is that objects are movable unless they're ""stop"", and the door's rule is ""door is [not specified]"", so it's probably movable. 

Wait, the door's rule is ""rule `door` 2 step up"", which means the door's property is defined by that rule. But what's the actual property? It might be that the door is a normal object, but to open it, you need a key. However, the key is at (-8,3), which is left of the door. 

But the key is also blocked by the same wall at (-4,3). So without removing the wall, I can't get the key. 

This is a loop. The wall blocks the key and the path to the door. 

Given all this, the only viable solution seems to be redefining the ""wall"" rule to remove its ""stop"" property. To do that, I need to move an ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" rule and change its text. 

The ""wall"" rule is at (-9,2). The closest ""is"" block is at (0,3), which is 9 steps to the right and 1 step down. That's a distance of √(81 + 1) = ≈9.06, which is too far to push. 

The next closest ""is"" block is at (0,1), which is 1 step up. Still too far. 

The ""is"" block at (-6,0","

The player is stuck in this Baba Is You level, and they keep defaulting to idle because the previous actions weren't valid. Let me try to figure out what's going on here.

First, looking at the observation, the active rule is still ""baba is you"", which means the player controlling Baba has the ability to move and possibly manipulate other rules. The map has several objects: a key, a door, walls, and some rules scattered around. The goal is probably to reach the win condition, which is indicated by the ""win"" rule. 

In the current setup, the ""win"" rule is positioned 1 step to the right and 3 steps up from Baba. The door is also 7 steps to the left and 3 steps up, which might be blocking the path. However, since the player can move Baba because ""baba is you"", they should be able to navigate around. But maybe there's a ""stop"" rule blocking the way?

Looking at the objects, there are several ""stop"" rules. The most relevant one might be the ""stop"" rule at 7 steps left and 2 steps up, next to a wall. That could be preventing movement in that direction. But since the player is Baba, who is ""you"", maybe they can push objects? Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects that aren't stopped. But if there's a ""stop"" rule on a wall, then those walls can't be moved. 

The ""key"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the current position. Maybe the player needs to get the key first to unlock the door? But the door is at 7 steps left and 3 steps up. Alternatively, maybe manipulating the rules could change the win condition or remove the stop property.

The active rules include ""baba is you"", ""win is right 1 step right"", ""door is up 2 steps"", etc. If the player can move the ""win"" rule to be under Baba, then touching it would make Baba the win. But the ""win"" rule is currently 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. To reach that, the player would need to move up and right. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which might be a barrier. However, the player can move Baba because ""baba is you"", unless there's a ""stop"" rule applying to Baba. But since ""baba is you"", and there's no rule saying ""baba is stop"", they should be able to move through walls, right? Wait, no. In Baba Is You, normally you can't go through walls unless the wall has a ""stop"" property. But here, the walls have ""wall is stop"", which means they are stale walls that can be pushed or moved if possible. Wait, no. The ""wall is stop"" rule means that any object labeled 'wall' has the 'stop' property. So the walls are immovable because they're stopped. But since the player is Baba, who is 'you', they can move, but they can't push the walls because they're stopped. So maybe the player needs to rearrange the rules to make the walls not stop.

Alternatively, the player could move the ""win"" rule to be under themselves. For example, if they move the ""win"" text block to be next to Baba, then touching it would make Baba the win. To do that, the player needs to move the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is currently 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So moving up three times and right once would get to the ""win"" rule. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the map layout.

Baba's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. Assuming Baba is at the starting point, perhaps near the lower part of the map. The ""key"" is 1 step right and 1 step down from somewhere. Wait, the key is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the current position? Or is that relative to another object? The observation lists objects with positions relative to the player's current location. So ""key 8 step to the left and 3 step up"" means the key is 8 steps left and 3 up from where the player is. Similarly, the door is 7 left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is 1 right and 3 up. 

So the player needs to get to the ""win"" rule, which is diagonally right and up from their position. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, that's to the left, so not blocking the path to the right. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left and 2 up, next to a wall. So if the player moves up two steps, they hit a ""stop"" wall, which they can't pass. But how to get around that?

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""is"" rule that's 3 steps up. There's a rule `is` at 3 step up. If the player moves that ""is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, they could create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"", making ""baba is win"". That would make Baba the win condition. But how to do that?

The player needs to move the ""is"" text block. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. So moving up three times would reach it. But again, the path might be blocked. Let's see. From the player's position, moving up three steps would take them to where the ""is"" rule is at 3 step up. But along the way, is there any obstruction? The walls are at 4 left and 3 up, which is to the left of the player's path up. So moving up three steps would reach the ""is"" rule. Once there, the player can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to the right next to ""baba"" (which is at 9 left and 3 down) to make ""baba is win"". 

But how to get to the ""baba"" rule? The ""rule baba"" is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe the player can create a rule that makes ""you"" into ""win"". Since there's a ""you"" rule at 7 left and 3 down. If the player can move ""you"" and ""win"" together with an ""is"" rule, they could make ""you is win"", but since the player is ""you"", that would make them win. 

Alternatively, the player could move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to themselves. The ""win"" rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So moving up three times and right once would get to the ""win"" rule. But the path up is blocked by the ""stop"" wall at 7 left and 2 up. Wait, if the player moves up two steps, they reach the ""stop"" wall at 7 left and 2 up. Then they can't move further up. Unless they can push the wall, but walls with ""stop"" can't be moved. 

So maybe the solution is to first move the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that removes the ""stop"" property from the wall. For example, moving ""is"" next to ""stop"" and ""wall"" to make ""stop is not wall"", but that's not possible because you can only create rules with existing subjects and properties. Alternatively, create ""wall is not stop"" by moving ""is"" next to ""wall"" and ""not stop"". But there's no ""not"" rule in the current active rules. 

Alternatively, the player could make the door a win by moving ""win"" next to the door. The door is at 7 left and 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. So moving the ""win"" rule left six steps to align with the door. But that's a long distance. 

Wait, perhaps the key is involved. The key is at 1 step right and 1 step down. Maybe the player needs to get the key first by moving down and right, then use it to unlock the door. But the door is at 7 left and 3 up, which is in the opposite direction. 

Alternatively, the player could move the ""is"" rule at 3 step up to create a new rule. For example, moving ""is"" to the right next to ""baba"" (which is at 9 left and 3 down) to make ""baba is win"". But to do that, the player needs to move the ""is"" rule all the way down to where ""baba"" is. That's a lot of steps down. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. There are two ""is"" rules: one at 3 step up and another at 1 step up. Moving the one at 1 step up next to ""win"" and ""you"" could create ""you is win"", making the player win. 

Let me think step by step. The player's goal is to reach the ""win"" rule or make themselves win. The current active rule is ""baba is you"", so the player is Baba. The ""win"" rule is 1 right and 3 up. To get there, the player needs to move up three times and right once. But moving up three steps would take them past the ""stop"" wall at 7 left and 2 up. Wait, the player's position isn't clear, but the objects are relative. Let's assume the player is at position (0,0). Then:

- Key is at (-8, 3)
- Door at (-7, 3)
- Wall at (-4, 3)
- ""is"" rule at (0,3)
- ""win"" rule at (1,3)
- ""wall"" rule at (-9,2)
- ""stop"" rule at (-7,2)
- Wall at (-4,2)
- ""door"" rule at (0,2)
- Wall at (-4,1)
- ""ball"" rule at (-1,1)
- ""is"" rule at (0,1)
- ""is"" rule at (-6,0)
- Wall at (-4,0)
- ""win"" rule at (1,0)
- Wall at (-4,-1)
- ""key"" rule at (1,-1)
- Wall at (-4,-2)
- ""baba"" rule at (-9,-3)
- ""is"" rule at (-8,-3)
- ""you"" rule at (-7,-3)
- Wall at (-4,-3)

So the player is likely at (0,0). The ""win"" rule is at (1,3). To get there, the player needs to move up three times (to y=3) and right once. But moving up once gets to (0,1), which has an ""is"" rule. Moving up again to (0,2), which has a ""door"" rule. Moving up to (0,3), which has the ""is"" rule. So the path up is clear except for the ""stop"" wall at (-7,2). Wait, the ""stop"" wall is at (-7,2), which is seven steps to the left and two up from the player's position. So if the player moves up to (0,2), they are at (0,2), and the ""stop"" wall is at (-7,2), which is far to the left. So moving up isn't blocked by that wall. The player can move up three times safely. 

Once at (0,3), the player can move right once to reach the ""win"" rule at (1,3). Then, touching the ""win"" rule would make them the win, since they are ""you"". So the actions should be: up, up, up, right. 

But in previous attempts, the player was defaulting to idle. Maybe the actions weren't sent correctly. The assistant needs to output exactly the action, like ""up"" or ""right"". 

So the correct sequence would be to move up three times and then right once. But since the player is giving one action at a time, the next immediate action should be ""up"" to move towards the ""is"" rule at (0,3). Once there, then ""right"" to reach the ""win"" rule. 

But in the current observation, the last action was ""up"", and the observation hasn't changed because maybe the path is blocked. Wait, no, looking at the objects, there's no wall blocking the path up from (0,0) to (0,3). The walls are at (-4,3), (-4,2), etc., which are to the left. So moving up should be possible. 

Therefore, the correct action here is to move ""up"" to reach the ""is"" rule at (0,3), which can then be used to create a new rule or just move to the ""win"" rule.

The user is stuck in this Baba Is You level where they keep getting defaulted to idle even when they try to move up or right. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means Baba can move. But despite moving directions, they're not progressing.

First, I need to look at the objects on the map. There's a key to the left, a door also to the left, and several walls. The rules like 'win' being to the right and 'door' up there. The problem might be that the door is a 'stop' because of the rule 'rule `door` 2 step up', which probably makes it immovable. But since the player is Baba and can move, maybe they need to interact with the door differently.

Wait, the active rules don't have anything changing 'door' to not stop. So the door is still a stop. To get past it, they might need to move the 'stop' rule away or change the door's property. But how? The player can move text blocks that aren't stop. So if they can grab the 'door' rule and move it, that might make the door no longer a stop.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `door` 2 step up'. The player's position isn't clear, but assuming they're near the upper part where the 'is' rules are, maybe they can move that 'door' rule. For example, moving the 'door' rule down so it's not applying to the door object anymore. Or perhaps they need to create a new rule like 'door is key' or something to override it.

Another thought: The 'win' rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. If the player can reach that 'win' rule, they might be able to move it or change it to 'baba is win'. But the current active rule is 'baba is you', so maybe they need to make themselves 'win' by moving the 'win' rule onto themselves.

Wait, the player is Baba, and they can move text blocks. So if they go to the 'win' rule that's 1 step to the right and 3 steps up, they can pick it up and place it onto themselves. For example, moving the 'win' text block next to Baba, making the rule 'baba is win'. That would make touching the door or something else a win condition. But the door is a stop, so maybe they need to remove the 'stop' rule as well.

Alternatively, the key is nearby. If they pick up the key and use it to unlock the door, but in Baba Is You, keys usually require a door rule. But since the door is a 'stop', maybe unlocking isn't the way. Instead, changing the door's rule to not be a stop.

So steps could be: Move to the 'door' rule (2 step up) and either move it away or change it. Or move the 'stop' rule (7 step left and 2 step up) away to remove the stop property from the door.

But how to execute that? The player needs to navigate to those text blocks. Since previous actions were moving up and right, maybe they are nearby. If they go up again to reach the 'door' rule at 2 step up, they can pick it up and move it. For example, moving the 'door' rule down so it's no longer applying to the door object.

Alternatively, moving the 'is' rule at 3 step up to combine with 'door' differently. But the active rule is still 'baba is you', so need to maintain that.

Another angle: The 'win' rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up. If the player can move that 'win' rule onto themselves, making 'baba is win', then touching anything (maybe the door) would make them win. But the door is a stop, so they can't move through it. So they might need to remove the stop property first.

So the plan is: 1. Move to the 'stop' rule (7 left, 2 up) and move it away. 2. Then move to the door and perhaps change its rule. Or 1. Move to the 'door' rule (2 up) and change it to something else. 3. Once the door is no longer a stop, move through it and reach the 'win' area.

But the player's current position isn't clear. The previous actions were moving up and right, maybe they are near the upper part. The 'is' rule at 3 step up is there. So perhaps moving up again to reach the 'door' rule at 2 step up, pick it up, and move it somewhere else. For example, move the 'door' rule to the right, making the rule 'door is right' or something that doesn't make the door a stop.

Alternatively, create a new rule like 'door is push' so it can be moved. But to do that, the player needs to have the 'is' rule nearby. There are multiple 'is' rules: one at 3 step up, another at 1 step up, and 6 step to the left. If the player can grab an 'is' rule and place it next to 'door' with a new property, like 'push'.

But the key is to make the door not a stop. So moving the existing 'stop' rule away. The 'stop' rule is at 7 left, 2 up. If the player moves that 'stop' rule down or right, then the door wouldn't be a stop anymore.

So possible actions: move down to the 'stop' rule and move it, or move right to the 'win' rule and attach it to Baba.

Given the previous attempts to move up and right, maybe the player is near the upper rules. So moving up again to get to the 'door' rule at 2 step up, then moving it. But how to specify the direction? The action needs to be a single step direction: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Wait, the actions are single steps. So perhaps the player needs to navigate to the specific text blocks. If they are currently one step away from the 'door' rule, then 'up' would get them there. But based on the observations, the 'door' rule is 2 step up from where? Maybe the player needs to move up twice. But previous attempts to move up didn't work, leading to idle. Maybe the player is blocked by a wall or a stop.

Looking at the objects: There are walls at various positions. The player might be next to a wall that's a 'stop', so moving into it does nothing. But since the player is Baba and 'baba is you', they can push objects unless they're 'stop'. Wait, no: 'baba is you' means you control Baba. 'stop' means objects can't be moved through. So if the player is trying to move into a 'stop' object, they can't.

So perhaps the player is stuck next to a wall that's a stop. To proceed, they need to either remove the 'stop' rule or change the wall's property.

Alternatively, the key is to the left, but the door is to the left as well. Maybe the player needs to get the key first, but the door is blocking the path. If the door is a stop, they can't move through it. So changing the door's rule is essential.

In summary, the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule (7 left, 2 up) and move it away.
2. Alternatively, move to the 'door' rule (2 up) and change it to a non-stop property.
3. Once the door is no longer a stop, move through it to the 'win' area.

But given the action has to be a single step, the immediate action should be to move towards the relevant text block. For example, if the player is one step away from the 'door' rule at 2 step up, then 'up' would get them there. Then they can pick up the 'door' rule and move it. But since the output is just a single action, the assistant has to choose the next step.

Alternatively, the player needs to move to the 'is' rule at 3 step up to create a new rule. For example, combining 'is' with 'stop' and changing it. But again, this requires multiple steps.

Considering the previous actions were moving up and right, leading to defaults, perhaps the player hasn't reached the text blocks yet. So the correct action now is to continue moving up to reach the 'door' rule at 2 step up, then move it.

But the observation shows the active rules and objects, but not the player's position. Assuming the player is near the bottom, needing to climb up to the text blocks. So 'up' would be the next action to get closer to the 'door' or 'is' rules.

Let's see. The player is Baba, and the rule is ""Baba IS YOU."" So I can move Baba around. The goal is probably to reach the door or the win object. The active rules haven't changed much except maybe the ones created by moving text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a key to the left and up, a door directly up-left from the key, walls everywhere, and a win rule to the right at 3 steps up. The door is likely blocking the way to the win, but I don't know if it's a stop or can be moved. 

The key is 8 steps left and 3 up. If I can get the key, maybe it opens the door. But to get there, I need to navigate through the walls. The rule `is` blocks are present; I need to move them to create new rules. For example, if I move the `key` text block next to Baba, then ""BABA IS KEY"" would make Baba a key. But would that help? Maybe not immediately. 

Alternatively, if I can make the door a win by moving the `win` rule next to the door. But the current `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 up. If I move that to the door's position, then touching the door would make me win. But how to do that? I need to move the `win` text block. 

Wait, the `is` rules are spread out. The main `is` is at 3 steps up. Maybe I can pick up an `is` block and place it next to the door and `win` to create ""DOOR IS WIN."" Then touching the door would be a win. But I need to get the `win` rule near the door. 

But how to move the `win` rule? I need to be adjacent to it. The `win` is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So from Baba's current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe near the bottom?), moving up three steps would reach the `win` rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps up, 4 steps left. Wait, the wall is at 4 steps left and 3 up. So if I'm at, say, position (0,0), moving up three steps would hit the wall. Hmm. Maybe Baba is at a different starting position. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is the way to proceed. Get the key, then use it to open the door. But how? If the key is on the left, maybe moving right to get it. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules first. 

Looking at the `is` blocks at different positions. The main `is` is at 3 steps up. If I move that `is` block next to Baba, then I can create a new rule. For example, moving `is` to where `baba` is, making ""BABA IS [something]"". But the `baba` rule is at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. That's probably too far. 

Alternatively, the `you` rule is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move `you` to Baba, then Baba becomes YOU. But again, positioning is key. 

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you,"" so the player is Baba. The goal is to reach the win condition. The `win` rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. So if I can move there, but there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. So the path is blocked. Maybe changing the wall's property. For example, if I can make the wall a stop or remove it. 

The `wall` rule is at 9 steps left and 2 steps up. If I move that `wall` rule next to the actual wall object (4 steps left and 3 up), then perhaps changing its property. But how? 

Alternatively, using the `is` blocks to create ""WALL IS NOT STOP"" or something. But I need to have the appropriate text blocks. 

Wait, the `stop` rule is at 7 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move `stop` away or replace it. 

This is getting complicated. Let's think step by step. 

First, current active rule is Baba is You. So I can move Baba. The win condition is at 1 step right and 3 up, but there's a wall there. So to get past the wall, maybe I need to make the wall passable. For that, I can create a rule like ""WALL IS NOT STOP"" by moving the `is` block next to `wall` and `not stop`, but I don't have a `not` block here. 

Alternatively, create ""WALL IS YOU"", but then touching the wall would make me you, which might not help. 

Another approach: get the key and use it. The key is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the `key` rule. Wait, the key object is 8 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I need to move towards that. But there are walls blocking the path. 

Alternatively, use the `is` blocks to make Baba a key. If I move the `key` rule next to Baba, then ""BABA IS KEY"". Then, if there's a rule saying ""KEY IS WIN"", but I don't see that. 

Alternatively, create ""DOOR IS WIN"" by moving the `win` rule next to the door. The door is at 7 steps left and 3 up. The `win` rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. So if I move the `win` rule left by 2 steps, placing it next to the door, then touching the door would make me win. 

But how to move the `win` rule? The `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up from Baba's current position. So if I move up three steps to get to the `win` rule, but there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. Wait, maybe the player's position is such that moving up three steps reaches the `win` rule without hitting the wall. Let me check the positions again. 

The wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. If the player is at, say, 5 steps left, moving left three steps would hit the wall. But maybe the player is on the right side. This is unclear. 

Alternatively, use the `is` block at 3 steps up. If I move that `is` block next to the `door` and `win`, creating ""DOOR IS WIN"". But the `is` block is at 3 steps up, same as the door. So moving down to the door's position, but there's a wall there. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the `win` rule to the door. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the `win` rule and move it. The `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up. So from Baba's position, moving up three steps to reach the `win` rule, then moving left twice to get next to the door. But if there's a wall in the way, that's a problem. 

Alternatively, use the `is` block at 1 step up. If I move that `is` block next to the `door` and `win`, creating the desired rule. 

Wait, the `is` block at 1 step up is a separate one. So moving that `is` to the door's position and combining with `win` could work. 

But how to get there? The player (Baba) needs to move around the walls. Let's consider the movement. 

If the player is at the bottom, maybe near the `baba` text block at 9 steps left and 3 steps down. But that's probably not the case. 

Alternatively, the player starts in the middle. The key is to the left and up. The door is up-left. The win is to the right up. 

This is getting too vague without a visual. Let's try to map it out. 

Assuming Baba is at the starting point, perhaps near the bottom center. The walls are in a grid. The `is` rules are scattered. The key is to the left and up, behind some walls. To get the key, need to move left and up, but walls are there. 

Alternatively, use the `is` blocks to rewrite rules. For example, move `is` next to `baba` and `win` to make ""BABA IS WIN"". Then touching Baba would make you win. But that's a stretch. 

Another idea: since ""Baba IS YOU"", if you can make ""YOU IS WIN"", then touching anything would win. But how? You would need to create ""YOU IS WIN"" by moving the `win` rule next to `you`. The `you` rule is at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. So moving the `win` rule there. 

But the `win` rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. So moving it down 6 steps and left 6 steps to reach the `you` position. That's a lot, but possible if there are no walls in between. 

Alternatively, move the `win` rule step by step. But each move can only be one step. 

This is really complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the `win` rule next to the door. Since the door is at 7 steps left and 3 up, and the `win` is at 1 step right and 3 up, moving the `win` rule left two steps would place it next to the door. 

To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to the `win` rule. The `win` rule is 1 step right and 3 steps up from Baba's current position. So first, move up three steps to reach the `win` rule. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 up. If Baba is not at that position, maybe the path is clear. 

Assuming the player can move up three steps to the `win` rule without hitting the wall, then move left two steps to place the `win` rule next to the door. Then, touching the door would make the player win. 

So the actions would be: up, up, up (to reach the `win` rule), then left, left. But each action is a single step. 

In the current observation, the player's last action was up, and the observation didn't change much. Maybe the player is stuck trying to move up but hitting a wall. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move the `is` block at 3 steps up to combine with the `door` and `win` rules. 

Wait, the `is` block at 3 steps up is a separate one. If the player moves that `is` block down to the door's level and places it next to `door` and `win`, creating ""DOOR IS WIN"". 

To do that, the player would need to move down from the `is` block's position (3 steps up) to the door's position (7 steps left and 3 up). But moving down from 3 steps up would land at the player's original position. Then moving left to reach the door. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the simplest valid action is to keep moving up towards the `win` rule, hoping to reach it and then move it to the door. 

But previous attempts to move up resulted in idle actions, possibly due to walls blocking the path. 

Alternatively, check if there's a way to make the wall a stop, but that doesn't help. 

Another angle: the `key` is present. If the player can get the key and use it on the door. But how? Maybe by creating a rule like ""KEY IS OPEN"" or similar. 

The `key` rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the key object. So to pick up the key, the player needs to move right and down. But there's a wall at 4 steps left and 2 steps up. 

This is really challenging without seeing the actual level layout. But based on the observation, the most logical next step is to try moving the `win` rule to the door by moving it left twice. To do that, the player must first reach the `win` rule, which is 1 step right and 3 steps up. Assuming they can move there, then left twice. 

So the actions would be: up, up, up (to reach the `win` rule's position), then left, left. 

But each action is a single step. So if the player's current position is such that moving up three steps gets them to the `win` rule, then left twice. 

Alternatively, if the player is already at the `win` rule's position, then left. 

In the current observation, the last action was up, and the observation didn't change, possibly because there's a wall blocking the path. 

Given that, maybe the correct action is to move right towards the `win` rule's position. Since the `win` is 1 step right and 3 steps up, moving right first could help avoid the wall. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to be precise. 

Alternatively, try moving the `is` block at 3 steps up to combine with other rules. 

In conclusion, the best course of action is to move the `win` rule to the door by navigating to its position and adjusting it. So the next action would be to move left from the `win` rule's position to place it next to the door.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rule is still ""baba is you,"" which means I can move around and maybe manipulate other rules. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but I need to check if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" is now 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's a key that's 7 steps left and 3 up, and a door at 6 steps left and 3 up. The walls are getting closer as I move, so I need to be careful not to run into any ""stop"" or ""wall"" rules.

The ""is"" rules are scattered. There's a rule `win` 2 steps right and 3 up, which probably means that touching that area makes you win. But I need to get there. The door is at 6 left and 3 up, which might be blocking the path. Since doors can usually be opened if you're ""push"" or have a key, but I don't know if I have a key yet. Wait, the key is at 7 left and 3 up, but after moving left once, maybe I grabbed it? Or is the key still there?

Wait, in the previous observations, when I moved left, the key's position changed. Let me check the latest observation. Now the key is 7 steps left and 3 up, door is 6 left and 3 up. So maybe moving left again would get me closer to the key. Or maybe I need to go up to the ""win"" area.

But the walls are 3 steps left and 3 up. So if I go up, I might hit a wall. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left and 2 up. So if I move up from my current position, I might trigger a stop. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules. There are multiple ""is"" blocks around. For example, there's a rule `is` 1 step right and 3 up, and another `is` 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move those ""is"" blocks to form new rules, like ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key,"" that could help. But how?

Baba is currently you, so if I can make a rule like ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. Or maybe ""you is win"" so that I am win. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule `is` is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I move that ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" then I can create ""baba is win.""

But how do I move the ""is"" blocks? I need to be able to push them. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" and if objects without ""stop"" or ""push"" can be moved, maybe I can move the ""is"" rules. Let me check the objects. Most walls are defined as ""wall"" or ""stop,"" but the ""is"" rules and other text blocks might be movable.

So, if I move the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 3 up next to the ""win"" rule, which is 2 steps right and 3 up, then I can form ""win is baba"" or ""baba is win."" Wait, the ""win"" rule is already there. Let me see: the current active rules include ""baba is you"" and other rules like ""win 1 step to the right and 3 step up."" So the ""win"" object is at that position.

If I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""is"" block is at 1 step right and 3 up. The ""baba"" rule is further down at 8 step left and 3 steps down. That might be too far. Alternatively, maybe there's another ""is"" block at 7 step left and 3 steps down. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 3 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""win."" But the positions are a bit complicated. Let me visualize the map.

Alternatively, since the key is nearby, maybe picking up the key first would help open the door. The door is at 6 left and 3 up. If I have the key, I can push the door. But how do I get the key? The key is at 7 left and 3 up. If I move left again, I can reach it. But moving left would take me to the key's position. Let's check the current position after moving left previously. The key is now 7 left and 3 up, so if I move left once, I would be at 7 left and 3 up, which is where the key is. Then I can pick it up? But in Baba Is You, you have to touch the key to pick it up. Once you touch it, you can carry it with you. Then, using the key to open the door.

But the door is at 6 left and 3 up. So after getting the key, moving right towards the door, then pushing it open. But doors in Baba Is You can be pushed if you're ""push"" or have the key. Since I'm ""baba is you,"" and if ""you"" can push, then maybe I can push the door. Alternatively, with the key, I can open the door.

So the plan could be: move left to get the key, then move right to the door, use the key to open it, then go up to the win area. But need to check if the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules to make the door not a stop. For example, if I can change ""door is stop"" to ""door is nothing,"" then I can pass through. The ""door"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up. So if I can move that ""door"" rule next to a different property, like ""stop"" to remove it.

Wait, the current rules include ""rule `door` 2 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up."" So the door's rule is at 2 step up, and stop is at 7 left and 2 up. Maybe if I can move the ""door"" rule next to ""stop"" and delete it, but not sure.

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""door is pass"" or something, but I don't have a ""pass"" rule. The available rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""stop,"" ""wall,"" ""door,"" ""key,"" ""baba,"" ""you.""

Hmm. Another approach: since I'm Baba and I'm you, maybe I can change the win condition. The current win is at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I can make a rule ""baba is win,"" then touching anywhere would make me win, but that's unlikely. Or maybe ""you is win,"" which since I'm you, I'd be win.

To do that, I need to create the rule ""you is win."" The ""you"" rule is at 7 step left and 3 steps down, and ""win"" is at 2 step right and 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at various places. For example, there's an ""is"" at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that ""is"" next to ""you"" and ""win,"" then I can form ""you is win.""

But how to move the ""is"" block? Since I'm Baba and I'm you, and if objects without ""stop"" can be moved, I can push the ""is"" block. The ""is"" at 1 step right and 3 up is near the win area. If I move left from my current position, maybe I can reach that ""is"" block.

Wait, in the current observation, after moving left, the key is now 7 left and 3 up. So if I move left again, I would be at the key's position. But the key is there, so touching it would let me carry it. Then, moving right towards the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 3 up. Wait, the positions are a bit confusing. Let me try to map it out.

Assuming my current position is at the original starting point, but after moving left multiple times, the objects' positions have shifted. The key is now 7 steps left and 3 up, door at 6 left and 3 up. The ""is"" rule at 1 step right and 3 up is relatively close to the win area.

So maybe the best move is to move up to reach that ""is"" block, then move it next to ""you"" and ""win"" to create the new rule. But how to do that?

Alternatively, since I have the key, maybe proceed to the door, open it, and then go to the win area. But the door is at 6 left and 3 up. From my current position (after moving left several times), I need to navigate through the walls.

The walls are at 3 step left and 3 up, so if I move up, I might hit a wall. The ""stop"" rule is at 6 left and 2 up, which is a wall that stops movement. So moving up from my current position might not be safe.

Alternatively, move left to get the key, then move right towards the door, use the key to open it, then proceed up. Let's see:

1. Move left to get the key (currently at 7 left, 3 up). So action: left.
2. Once at the key, maybe pick it up (automatically?), then move right to the door at 6 left, 3 up.
3. Use the key to open the door, which might change the door's rule from ""stop"" to something else.
4. Then move up past the door to the win area.

But I need to check if the door requires the key to be pushed or opened. In Baba Is You, pushing a door requires the key, or sometimes you can push it if you're ""push."" Since I'm Baba and you, and if ""you"" can push, then maybe I can push the door without the key, but having the key might make it easier.

Alternatively, moving the ""door"" rule to remove its ""stop"" property. For example, if the door's rule is ""door is stop,"" changing it to ""door is nothing"" would make it passable. But to do that, I need to edit the rule.

The current rules include ""rule `door` 2 step up."" If I can move that ""door"" rule next to ""stop"" and delete it, but not sure. Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""door is not stop.""

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to grab the key and use it to open the door, then proceed.

So, step-by-step:

- Move left to get the key (position 7 left, 3 up).
- Then move right towards the door (6 left, 3 up).
- Use the key to open the door, which might involve pushing it while holding the key.
- Once the door is open, move up to the win area.

But how to input these actions? Each move is one step. So from the current position, after moving left multiple times, the key is at 7 left, 3 up. My current position might be at 8 left, 3 up, given that the key was previously 8 steps left and after moving left once, it's now 7.

Wait, in the latest observation, after moving left, the key is 7 left and 3 up. So if I move left again, I reach the key. Then, move right to get to the door at 6 left, 3 up. That's one step right. Then, push the door, which might require another action. But doors in Baba Is You can be pushed by walking into them if you're ""push,"" which I might be since I'm ""baba is you.""

Alternatively, since I have the key, I can open the door by moving it. But I'm not sure. Another approach is to move the ""door"" rule to a different position to change its property.

The ""door"" rule is at 2 step up. If I can move that text block next to ""stop"" and remove the ""stop"" property. For example, if the rule is ""door is stop,"" changing it to ""door is pass"" by moving the text blocks. But how?

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe the immediate action is to move left to get the key, then proceed.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the ""WIN"" object, but sometimes the rules change that. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means I can move any object or text block that isn't stopped.

Looking at the map, the key and door are positioned to the left and up. The ""win"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's a wall 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up, and another wall blocking the path to the door. The ""stop"" rule is near some walls, which means I can't push those.

The key is 6 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I need to get that key first to unlock the door? But how? The door is behind a wall. Wait, the ""door"" rule is there, so if I can change that rule, maybe the door isn't a stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the ""door"" text block. However, the walls might be blocking the way.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" I can move the text blocks. The ""is"" rules are scattered. There's a rule ""is"" 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. If I move that ""is"" next to another text block, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move ""is"" next to ""door,"" it would make ""door is [something]."" But what's the something? The goal is to make ""baba is win"" or something like that.

Wait, the current active rules are ""baba is you."" The ""win"" rule is separate. If I can turn ""baba"" into ""win,"" then touching the win object would make me win. But how? To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks. There's a ""baba"" rule at 7 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""baba"" text next to a ""win"" or ""you,"" maybe I can create ""baba is win.""

But first, I need to get to those text blocks. The walls are blocking the path. The walls are 2 steps left and 3 steps up, so maybe moving left or up would help. Let me check the positions again. The key is at 6 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is 2 right, 3 up. If I move up to that ""is"" rule, maybe I can combine it with another block.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 5 left, 3 steps down. If I can make ""baba is you"" into ""baba is win,"" then touching the win object would work. To do that, I need to replace ""you"" with ""win"" next to ""baba."" But the ""you"" rule is far away.

Wait, the ""is"" rules are movable. If I move an ""is"" next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win,"" that could create ""baba is win."" So the plan is: move Baba (which I can do because ""baba is you"") to an ""is"" rule, then move that ""is"" next to ""baba"" to form ""baba is [something],"" and then move another ""is"" next to ""win"" to complete ""baba is win.""

But how to get there? The current position might be at the original Baba position. Let's assume I'm at the starting point. Moving left or up would help reach the ""is"" rules. For example, moving left from the initial position would get to the ""is"" rule at 6 step left. Then move up to the ""is"" at 3 step up. Then combine them.

Alternatively, the key is nearby. If I pick up the key and use it to unlock the door, but the door is behind a wall. So maybe first move left to get the key, then use it on the door. But how to unlock the door? The door's rule is there, but if I can change it to not be a stop. If there's a ""stop"" rule near the door, maybe I can remove it.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 5 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall behind the door wouldn't stop me. But moving ""stop"" requires that it's not itself a stop. But since ""stop"" is a property, maybe I can move it. But the walls are there, so path might be blocked.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap. The main goals are:

1. Reach the ""win"" object, which is currently 3 right and 3 up, but blocked by walls.
2. Modify the rules to make touching the ""win"" object win the level. Perhaps by making ""baba is win.""

To do that, I need to manipulate the text blocks. The available ""is"" rules can be moved. So the strategy is to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by placing an ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win.""

Looking at the current positions:

- ""baba"" rule is at 7 left, 3 down.
- ""win"" rule is at 3 right, 3 up.

These are quite far apart. To move them closer, I need to navigate Baba (since ""baba is you"") to those areas, but there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, use existing ""is"" rules to bridge the gap. For example, take an ""is"" rule that's nearby and move it next to ""baba"" and then next to ""win.""

The ""is"" rules are at:

- 3 step up (right 2)
- 1 step up (right 1)
- 6 step left (maybe that's a separate one)
- 3 steps down (left 7, down 3)

Hmm. Maybe the closest ""is"" is at 3 step up, right 2. If I can move left to that ""is"" rule, then move it next to ""baba"" which is at 7 left, 3 down. That seems too far. Alternatively, move the ""is"" at 1 step up, right 1. Maybe combine that with the ""ball"" rule? Not sure.

Alternatively, the ""key"" is at 6 left, 3 up. If I move left to get the key, then use it on the door. But the door is at 5 left, 3 up, behind a wall. So maybe after getting the key, push the wall? But walls are ""stop,"" so unless the ""stop"" property is removed, I can't push them.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 5 left, 2 up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall behind it (at 5 left, 3 up) wouldn't be a stop. So moving the ""stop"" rule somewhere else might allow me to push the wall.

But how? To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be able to move it. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move it if it's not itself stopped. But the ""stop"" rule is a property, so maybe moving it is allowed. Let's say I move the ""stop"" rule to another spot, then the wall at 5 left, 3 up would no longer be stopped, and I could push it aside.

Once the wall is moved, I could go through to the door and maybe interact with it. But the door's rule is ""door is door,"" which doesn't do much. Unless I change it to ""door is key"" or something, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, after removing the ""stop"" property from the wall, maybe I can push the wall to block another path, but that doesn't seem helpful.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's think differently. The immediate goal is to reach the ""win"" object. The ""win"" rule is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There's a wall there, but if I can make that wall not a stop, I could push it out of the way.

The wall at 3 left and 3 up has the ""wall"" rule at 8 left and 2 up. Not sure. Alternatively, the ""wall"" rule itself is at 7 left and 2 up. If I can move that ""wall"" rule away, then the wall at 3 left, 3 up wouldn't be a wall anymore. But how?

Wait, the ""wall"" rule is a text block that defines what a wall is. If I move that ""wall"" rule, then the definition of a wall changes. For example, if I move ""wall"" next to ""key,"" then ""key is wall,"" making the key a wall. But that might block paths.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""wall"" rule away, then any object labeled ""wall"" would no longer have the wall property. But the current walls are at specific positions, so changing the ""wall"" rule's definition would affect all walls.

This seems complex. Let's focus on the immediate actions. The last observation shows that after moving left twice, the key is now at 6 left, 3 up, and the ""win"" is at 3 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rules are nearby. Maybe the best move is to move left again to reach the ""is"" rule at 6 left, then move up to combine it with ""baba"" and ""win.""

Alternatively, since the user is now at a position where moving left gets closer to the ""is"" rule, maybe the next action should be to move left to reach that ""is"" rule, then use it to create a new rule.

So, the chosen action is left.

Let's see. The current rules are ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I do, I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, but maybe I can change that. Let's look at the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key that's getting closer to my position. The key was 8 steps left and 3 up initially, and now it's down to 5 steps left and 3 up. Wait, maybe I'm moving towards it? Or maybe the key is moving? Not sure, but I need to get to the key first to possibly unlock the door.

The door is at 4 steps left and 3 up. Behind the door there's a wall, which is probably a stop or a wall. So to get past the door, I might need to use the key. But how? If I have the key, maybe I can move it to the door's position and then the door becomes passable? Or maybe changing a rule to make the door not a stop.

But right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can pick up text blocks. The ""win"" object is 4 steps to the right, but it's blocked by walls. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps left and 2 up, so that wall is immovable. The ""door"" rule is at 2 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that ""door"" text block somewhere else, maybe I can change its property.

Wait, the key is nearby. If I move to the key's position, I can pick it up. Let me check the map again. The key is 5 steps left and 3 up. But how do I move there? My current position isn't clear, but the objects are relative. Maybe I need to move left or right to reach the key.

Looking at the latest observation, the key is at 5 steps left and 3 up. The door is at 4 steps left and 3 up. So if I move left a few times, I can reach the key. Once I have the key, I can go to the door and maybe use the key to open it. But in Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors when placed next to them. So if I move the key to the door's position, the door might become passable.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""door"" rule. The ""door"" rule is at 3 steps right and 2 up. If I can move that text block and combine it with another rule, like making door IS NOT STOP or something. But I need to find the ""is"" text blocks. There are multiple ""is"" rules on the map. For example, there's a rule `is` 3 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""door"" rule, I could change it to ""door is you"" or ""door is win"". Wait, but the active rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can pick up objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself ""win"" by creating a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to find a ""win"" text block and an ""is"" text block. The ""win"" is 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. There's also a ""win"" rule at 2 steps right. So if I can move the ""is"" next to the ""baba"" rule, I could make ""baba is win"". Let's see: the rule `baba` is at 6 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 5 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I move right towards the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, I could place them together as ""baba is win"".

But first, I need to reach those text blocks. My current position isn't specified, but the objects are relative. The key is moving closer each time, so maybe I should focus on getting the key first. Once I have the key, I can unlock the door. Alternatively, changing the rules to become win directly might be faster.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move to the key's position (5 steps left, 3 up) by moving left multiple times.
2. Pick up the key.
3. Move to the door (4 steps left, 3 up) and place the key there to unlock.
4. Navigate past the door to the win condition.

Alternatively:

1. Find the ""baba"" and ""is"" text blocks.
2. Move them together to create ""baba is win"", making myself the win condition.

Which is quicker? Getting the key might take several left moves, but changing the rule could be faster if possible.

Looking at the latest observation:

- rule `baba` is at 6 step to the left and 3 steps down.
- rule `is` is at 5 step to the left and 3 steps down.
- rule `you` is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down.

So if I can move the ""is"" next to ""baba"", then create ""baba is win"". The ""win"" rule is at 4 steps to the right. So maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule to the ""baba"" and ""is"" location.

But how do I move the text blocks? I can only move them if they're not defined as STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 2 step up, which is a wall. So other text blocks like ""is"", ""win"", ""door"", etc., can be moved.

So the plan is:

- Move to the position of the ""baba"" rule (6 left, 3 down).
- Pick up the ""is"" rule (5 left, 3 down) and move it next to ""baba"".
- Then, pick up the ""win"" rule (4 right, 3 up) and move it next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to form ""baba is win"".

This would make Baba the win condition, so I just need to reach Baba (myself) which I already am. So maybe I can just stop moving and win?

But in the current rules, ""baba is you"", so I am Baba. If I make ""baba is win"", then I win by existing. So the action would be to rearrange the text blocks to form that rule.

To do that, I need to:

1. Move to the ""baba"" rule's location (6 left, 3 down).
2. Move the ""is"" rule from 5 left, 3 down to be next to ""baba"".
3. Move the ""win"" rule from 4 right, 3 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

But navigation is needed. Let's see the current positions:

- rule `baba` is at 6 step to the left and 3 steps down.
- rule `is` is at 5 step to the left and 3 steps down.
- rule `win` is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up.

Assuming my current position is the origin (0,0), the ""baba"" rule is at (-6, -3). The ""is"" is at (-5, -3). The ""win"" is at (4, 3).

To get to the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules, I need to move left and down. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 4 step left and 3 step up, which is a stop. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", I can push or move objects that are not STOP. Wait, the STOP property means they can't be moved. So walls that are STOP are immovable.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 4 step to the left and 3 step up is a STOP wall.
- rule `stop` is at 7 step left and 2 step up, which defines that wall as STOP.

So to move past the STOP wall, I might need to change the ""stop"" rule. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, focus on changing the rules to make myself win. Let's try that.

First, I need to reach the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules. If I move left 5 steps and down 3 steps, I would be at the ""is"" rule's position. Then move left again to the ""baba"" rule. But between me and the ""baba"" rule, are there any walls?

The wall at 4 step left and 3 up is a STOP, but that's up, not in my path. The walls on the left are at 4 step left at various positions, but they are not STOP if their rule isn't active. Wait, the wall rules are defined by the ""wall"" text blocks. For example, rule `wall` at 9 step left and 2 step up means that the object at that position is a wall. But if I move the ""wall"" rule, the actual wall's property changes.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's faster to go get the key and unlock the door. Let's see:

The key is at 5 step left and 3 up. To reach it, move left 5 times. But between here and there, are there walls? The wall at 4 step left and 3 up is a STOP, which I can't move through. So if I'm at position (0,0), moving left 5 steps would take me to (-5,0), but there's a wall at (-4, 0) which is a STOP. So I can't pass through that wall.

Therefore, I can't reach the key by moving left directly. Need to find another path. Maybe move up or down around the walls.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `is` at 3 step left and 1 step up. Maybe I can use that to create a new rule. Alternatively, move diagonally?

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move up, down, left, or right, one step at a time. Diagonal moves aren't allowed. So I need to navigate around the walls.

The STOP wall is at (-4, 0). To go around it, I could move up or down. For example, from (0,0), move up to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), etc., avoiding the STOP wall.

But this requires planning the path. Let's try to outline a path to the key:

Current position: assume (0,0).

Key is at (-5,3).

But the path is blocked by walls at (-4,0) which is a STOP. So need to go around.

Possible route:

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Move left to (-1,1).
3. Move left to (-2,1).
4. Move left to (-3,1).
5. Move up to (-3,2).
6. Move left to (-4,2) – but there's a wall at (-4,2) as per the objects: wall 4 step to the left and 2 step up is at (-4,2). And rule `stop` is at (-7, -2), which defines that wall as STOP. So (-4,2) is a STOP wall, can't move through.
   
 Alternative route:
1. From (0,0), move up to (0,1).
2. Move right to (1,1).
3. Move up to (1,2).
4. Move right to (2,2).
5. Move up to (2,3).
6. Now at (2,3), the key is at (-5,3). That's too far left. Maybe this isn't the best path.

Alternatively, move down from (0,0) to (0,-1), then left to (-1,-1), etc., but not sure if that leads anywhere.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe changing the rules to make myself win is the better approach, as it doesn't require navigating through walls.

So, back to the rule-changing idea. The ""baba"" rule is at (-6,-3), ""is"" at (-5,-3), and ""win"" is at (4,3).

I need to move the ""is"" to be next to ""baba"", so (-6,-3) and (-5,-3) are adjacent. Then move the ""win"" to (-4,-3) to form ""baba is win"".

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule from (-5,-3) to (-6,-3) next to ""baba"". Then move the ""win"" rule from (4,3) to (-4,-3). That seems possible if there's a path.

But how to move the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at (-5,-3). To move it left to (-6,-3), I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba (you), and the ""is"" rule isn't STOP, I can move it.

So steps:

1. Move to the position of the ""is"" rule at (-5,-3).
2. Push the ""is"" rule left to (-6,-3) where ""baba"" is.
3. Now, ""baba"" and ""is"" are adjacent.
4. Next, move to the ""win"" rule at (4,3).
5. Push the ""win"" rule left and down to (-4,-3), adjacent to ""baba"" and ""is"".

This would create the rule ""baba is win"", making me the win condition. Then I can just stay still and win.

So the actions needed are:

- Move left to reach the ""is"" rule.
- Push ""is"" left.
- Move to the ""win"" rule.
- Push ""win"" to the desired position.

But how many steps does this take? Let's count.

Assuming starting position is (0,0):

To reach (-5,-3):

- Move left 5 times.
- Move down 3 times.

But there are walls along the way. For example, at (-4,0) there's a STOP wall. So need to avoid that.

Alternative path to (-5,-3):

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Move left to (-1,1).
3. Move left to (-2,1).
4. Move left to (-3,1).
5. Move down to (-3,0).
6. Move left to (-4,0) – but it's a STOP, can't move.
   
Alternative:

1. (0,0) → up → (0,1)
2. → left → (-1,1)
3. → left → (-2,1)
4. → down → (-2,0)
5. → left → (-3,0)
6. → down → (-3,-1)
7. → left → (-4,-1)
8. → down → (-4,-2)
9. → left → (-5,-2)
10. → down → (-5,-3)

This path avoids the STOP wall at (-4,0). So 10 moves to reach (-5,-3).

Once there, push the ""is"" rule left to (-6,-3). That's one more move left.

Then, from (-6,-3), need to get to the ""win"" rule at (4,3). That's a long distance. Maybe go back to the starting point and then move to the ""win"" rule's location.

But this is getting too many steps. Alternatively, after placing ""is"" next to ""baba"", maybe the ""win"" rule is nearby.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is at (4,3), which is far to the right and up. To reach there from (-6,-3):

1. Move right 10 times.
2. Move up 6 times.

But along the way, there are walls. For example, at (4,3) there's a wall and a door. But since I'm changing the rules, maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, once ""baba is win"" is created, I don't need to move to the ""win"" object; just existing as Baba makes me win. So perhaps after placing the rules, the game is won.

Therefore, the critical steps are moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules into place.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move left 5, down 3 (avoiding walls) to reach (-5,-3).
2. Move left to push ""is"" to (-6,-3).
3. Move to (4,3) where ""win"" is located.
4. Move left and down to place ""win"" next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

But this requires precise navigation.

Given the time constraints in the game, maybe the fastest way is to focus on moving the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.

Given the latest observation, the key is now at 5 steps left and 3 up, closer each time. But navigating there is blocked. Changing the rules seems more feasible.

Therefore, the chosen action is to move left towards the ""is"" rule to position it next to ""baba"".

Let's see. In Baba Is You, the goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is often a door. But I need to check the current rules. Right now, the active rule is ""baba is you,"" which means whatever I move, Baba can do. The other objects include keys, doors, walls, and some rules on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a door 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up. To get there, I need to move left and up. But there are walls in the way. The wall is 1 step up, so maybe I can push it if I'm defined as something that can move walls. Wait, the current rule is ""baba is you,"" so I can push objects that aren't STOP. The walls are defined as ""stop,"" so I can't push them. That's a problem.

There's a key nearby, 4 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The key is under a wall that's 2 steps up. If I could move that wall, I could get the key. But since walls are STOP, I can't push them. Hmm.

Wait, the rules on the map include ""rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 3 step up."" Maybe I can move that ""is"" rule to change other rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""key is you,"" that could help. Let me think. If I move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I could create ""baba is win,"" making Baba the win condition. Then, touching Baba would make me win. Alternatively, if I can make ""key is you,"" then picking up the key would let me move it, but I already am you because ""baba is you.""

Alternatively, the door is a WIN object, so if I can reach it. But the door is behind walls. The door is at 3 left, 3 up. The walls are at 1 step up, 2 step up, etc. Maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to remove the STOP property from the walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into something else, like ""wall is nothing,"" but I don't have the ""nothing"" rule here. The available rules are ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""door,"" ""baba,"" ""you,"" ""key.""

Looking at the rules on the map, there's a ""rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up."" If I can move that ""stop"" rule away or replace it, maybe walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But to move a rule, I need to be able to move text blocks that aren't STOP. Since I'm Baba (you), and the rules that define STOP are in place, I can't move those STOP properties. So that's tricky.

Another angle: the ""rule `is` 3 step up"" is nearby. If I can move that ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""win,"" I can create ""baba is win."" Let me check the positions. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps up. The ""win"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So if I move left from the ""is"" rule, I can align it with ""baba"" which is 9 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, no, the Baba rule is at 9 left, 3 down, which is far away. Maybe I need to find the ""baba"" text block. Oh, there's a rule `baba` at 9 step to the left and 3 steps down. That's quite far.

Alternatively, the ""rule `is`"" at 3 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule to connect to ""baba"" and ""win."" But the positions might not align. Let me visualize. Suppose I'm at the initial position, maybe near the bottom? The key is moving left each time I move left, so I must be moving towards it. The key started at 8 steps left, then 7, 6, etc., so each time I move left, the key comes closer. Now it's at 4 steps left. If I keep moving left, I'll reach the key. But how to get past the walls.

Wait, the walls are at 1 step up, 2 step up, etc. If I can move the ""door"" rule or another rule to change their properties. For example, if I can make ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is push"" or something, but I don't have the ""push"" rule. The available rules are limited.

Another idea: since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can push the ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to ""key"" and ""you,"" making ""key is you."" Then the key would become me, and I could pick it up. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule to the key's position. Let's see where the ""is"" rules are. There's one at 3 step up, another at 1 step up, and others at various positions. The key is at 4 step left and 3 step up. The ""is"" rule at 3 step up is 4 steps to the right of the key. So if I move left from that ""is"" rule, I can align it with the key. But how to move the ""is"" rule. Since I'm you, and the ""is"" rule isn't STOP, I can push it. So moving up to get to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then left to position it next to the key.

So the steps would be: move up to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then left to move it next to the key. Then create ""key is you."" Once that's done, picking up the key would let me move it, but I'm already you, so maybe I can use the key to unlock the door. Alternatively, with the key, maybe I can push walls, but walls are still STOP unless their rule is changed.

Wait, if I make ""key is you,"" then the key becomes me. So if I pick up the key, I can move it, but I'm already you. Maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, making ""key is win"" so touching the key wins. But the door is still there. Hmm.

Alternatively, create ""door is win"" so that the door is the win condition. But the door is behind walls. If I could move the door, but doors are STOP unless their rule is changed. The rule for door is at 2 step up. If I can move that ""door"" rule, maybe making it ""door is win."" But how. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to door and win. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. The door is at 7 step left and 3 step up. So the ""is"" rule needs to be between them. But the ""is"" rule is at 3 step up, 4 steps to the right of the win rule. So moving the ""is"" rule left to connect door and win.

But to move the ""is"" rule, I have to be able to move it. Since I'm you, and the ""is"" rule isn't STOP, I can push it. So from the current position, which seems to be moving left each time, maybe I need to position myself to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 step up. Let's see: the latest observation has the key at 4 step left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. So if I'm next to the key, moving up to that ""is"" rule, then left to position it between door and win. But the door is at 3 step left and 3 up, and win is at 5 step right and 3 up. So the ""is"" rule needs to be between door and win. The current ""is"" rule is at 4 steps right, 3 up. So moving left twice would place it between door (3 left) and win (5 right). Wait, coordinates might be tricky. Let me clarify positions.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at a certain position, and the objects are relative. The key is moving left each time I move left, so maybe I'm following it. The latest observation shows the key at 4 step left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps right and 3 step up. So to get to that ""is"" rule, I need to move right. But the walls are at 1 step up, which is in the way. Alternatively, move up first to reach the ""is"" rule, then left.

But the walls at 1 step up are STOP, so I can't push them. So maybe I need to find a different path. Alternatively, use the ""key"" to unlock something. If I can get the key, maybe I can use it on the door. But the door is a WIN object, so touching it would win, but it's behind walls.

Wait, the active rules are still ""baba is you."" So I can push objects that aren't STOP. The walls are STOP, but the key, door, and other objects aren't. So if I can move the door or key around. The door is at 3 left, 3 up. If I could move the door, I could place it elsewhere. But doors are STOP unless their rule is changed. The rule for door is at 2 step up, 4 steps right and 2 step up. So to change that rule, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to it. For example, make ""door is win.""

But this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach WIN (door) or change WIN to something reachable.
- Current rules: Baba is you.
- Key is nearby, but behind walls.
- Walls are STOP, can't be pushed.
- Rules on the map can be moved to create new rules.

Possible solution steps:

1. Move the ""is"" rule to connect ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win."" Then touching Baba (myself) would win.
2. Alternatively, move ""is"" to connect ""key"" and ""you"" to make picking up the key allow movement.
3. Or move ""is"" to connect ""door"" and ""win"" to make the door the win condition.

Let's focus on the first option: making ""baba is win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 9 step left, 3 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 steps right, 3 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 steps right, 3 step up. So to create ""baba is win,"" I need to move the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win.""

But the distance is quite large. The ""is"" rule is currently 4 steps right and 3 step up from the ""win"" rule. To get it next to ""baba,"" which is 9 steps left and 3 steps down, it's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, the other ""is"" rule at 1 step up. Let's see: the ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. The ""is"" rule at 1 step up is 4 steps to the right of the ""win"" rule. So moving left from there to connect to ""baba"" or ""door.""

This seems challenging. Maybe another approach: use the key. If I can get the key and then move it to a position where I can push walls. But walls are still STOP.

Wait, the ""rule `stop` 7 step to the left and 2 step up"" is present. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls, then I could push them. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, make ""wall is nothing"" or another property. But I don't have the ""nothing"" rule. However, if I can replace ""stop"" with another property, like ""push,"" but I don't have that either.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be movable, but that's risky because walls are blocking the path.

Another idea: since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can push the ""stop"" rule away. The ""stop"" rule is at 7 left, 2 up. If I can move it, maybe walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be able to move it. Since it's a text block, and I'm you, and unless it's defined as STOP, I can move it. But the ""stop"" rule itself is just a text block; the property STOP is applied to walls. So moving the ""stop"" rule doesn't change the walls; it just moves the text. So that might not help.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's think again about the current positions. The key is at 4 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up. If I can move left from the key to reach the ""is"" rule. Wait, the key is 4 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is 4 right, 3 up. So the distance between them is 8 steps horizontally. That's too far to move left or right in one step. Maybe I need to approach from above or below.

Alternatively, the ""is"" rule at 3 step up is directly above the key. If I move up to that ""is"" rule, then left to position it next to the key. But how to get there. The key is at 4 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up. So to reach the ""is"" rule, I need to move right from the key. But there's a wall at 1 step up, which is in the way. The wall at 1 step up is 2 step up from the current position? Not sure. The walls are at varying positions, but some are blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe move up to the ""is"" rule at 3 step up, then left to align with the key. Let's say I'm currently at the key's position (4 left, 3 up). Moving up takes me to the ""is"" rule (4 right, 3 up). Wait, no. If the key is at 4 left, 3 up, and the ""is"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up, then they are opposite each other horizontally. So to move from the key to the ""is"" rule, I need to move right 8 steps, which isn't possible in one move. This suggests that the player is not at the same position as the key, but perhaps adjacent.

Maybe the player's position is somewhere else, and the key is moving left as the player moves left. In previous steps, the user kept moving left, causing the key to move left each time. Now the key is at 4 step left, 3 up. The player needs to position themselves to interact with the rules.

Another angle: the ""rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"" is present. If I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule between ""baba"" and ""win."" The ""baba"" rule is at 9 left, 3 down, which is far away. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" rule left from 4 right to between baba and win is impossible due to distance.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule at 1 step up. The ""win"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. The ""is"" rule at 1 step up is 4 steps to the right of the ""win"" rule. Moving left twice would position it next to ""win,"" but then what? If I make ""something is win,"" but there's nothing nearby to connect.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to keep moving left to reach the key, then use the key to unlock the door. But how? The key is a regular object; unless there's a rule that allows using it on the door, which there isn't by default. The door's rule is ""door is door,"" I think. So unless I change the door's rule, the key doesn't help.

Wait, the door has a rule at 2 step up and 4 steps right and 2 step up. If I can move that ""door"" rule next to the ""key"" and ""win"" rules, maybe create ""door is key"" or something. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, make ""door is win"" so that the door is the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule between door and win.

The door is at 3 step left and 3 step up. The win rule is at 5 step right and 3 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 step right and 3 step up. So moving the ""is"" rule left from 4 step right to between door (3 left) and win (5 right) would require moving left twice. But the current ""is"" rule is at 4 step right, 3 step up. If I move left twice, it would be at 2 step right, 3 step up. That's still not between door and win. The door is at 3 left, so the ""is"" rule would need to be at 3 left to connect to door. But that's impossible with a single move.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another rule to modify. The ""rule `ball` 1 step to the left and 1 step up"" is present. If I can make ""ball is win,"" then the ball would be the win condition. The ball is at 1 left, 1 up. The win rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 right, 3 up. So moving the ""is"" rule left from 4 right to between ball and win. That would require moving left four times, which isn't feasible in one step.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is to keep moving left to grab the key and then find a way to use it. But without a rule that allows using the key, it's useless.

Wait, the latest observation shows that after moving left multiple times, the key is now at 4 step left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 4 step right, 3 up. If I could move the ""is"" rule to the left, aligning","
