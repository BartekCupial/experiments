Let's tackle this Baba Is You level. The goal is to figure out the sequence of actions needed to reach the WIN condition, which right now is the key. The active rules are key IS WIN, wall IS STOP, and baba IS YOU. So, I'm Baba, and walls are stops. The key is somewhere on the map.

First, I need to locate all the objects and rules. From the observation, the key is 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up from my current position. The rules that make up ""key IS WIN"" are located 4 steps right and 4 up, followed by 'is' and 'win'. So those text blocks are forming that rule.

But to manipulate the rules, I need to move those text blocks. However, can I move them? The rules say that wall is stop, so if any object is a wall, I can't move it. Also, I can only move objects that aren't stopped. Let's check the objects. The walls are in various positions, but the rules like 'key', 'is', 'win', 'wall', etc., are separate objects. Are those considered movable?

Since the active rules are key IS WIN, wall IS STOP, and baba IS YOU, I'm Baba (you), so I can move unless blocked by a stop. The walls are stops, so I can't walk through them. The key is the win object, but the rule says key is win, so maybe touching it would make me win? Wait, no. In Baba Is You, usually, you have to be the same thing as the WIN object. Since I'm Baba and there's no rule saying Baba IS WIN, just that key IS WIN, so I need to become the key or change the WIN rule.

But how? To change the rule, I need to move the 'key IS WIN' text blocks. Let's see: the 'key' rule is 4 right, 4 up. The 'is' is next, then 'win'. To break that rule, I might need to move one of them so the rule is no longer connected. Alternatively, create a new rule that changes what WIN is.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself WIN. If I can create a rule like 'BABA IS WIN', that would let me win by just being Baba. But to do that, I need to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks. Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'baba' 4 steps left and 2 steps down, followed by 'is' and 'you'. So the existing rule is 'BABA IS YOU'. To change that to 'BABA IS WIN', I need to replace 'you' with 'win'.

But first, I need to reach those text blocks. Let's map out the positions. The current player (Baba) is probably positioned somewhere. Let's assume the starting position is at (0,0), and the directions are relative. Let's parse the objects:

- Wall 1 step right, 4 up: So at (1,4) is a wall.
- Rule 'key' at (4,4)
- Rule 'is' at (5,4)
- Rule 'win' at (6,4)
- Rule 'wall' at (4,-1) (since 4 steps left is -4, and 3 up is +3, wait, the description says ""4 step to the left and 3 step up"" would be (-4,3). But perhaps the coordinates are relative. Wait, the problem is that the directions are given as steps in relative terms. So each step is a unit in a grid.

The key is 4 steps right and 4 up from the player's current position. Let's say the player is at (0,0). Then the key is at (4,4). The wall is at (1,4), (1,3), etc. The rules 'key', 'is', 'win' are in a horizontal line at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). The 'wall' rule is at (-4,3) (4 left steps from 0 is -4, 3 up is +3), followed by 'is' at (-5,3), and 'stop' at (-6,3). Then another wall at (1,3), etc.

So the layout is such that there's a horizontal wall starting at (1,4) going left? Or maybe the walls are vertical. The key is at (4,4), which is diagonally northeast of the player. But between the player and the key, there's a wall at (1,4), which is one step right and four up. So the player is at (0,0), the key is at (4,4), but there's a wall at (1,4), blocking the direct path. Also, walls below the key at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), and (1,-1). So the key is north of a vertical wall at x=1.

To get to the key, the player needs to go around the wall. But since the player is at (0,0), moving right once would hit the wall at (1,0) (since there's a wall at (1,1), (1,2), etc., down to (1,-1)). Wait, the walls listed are:

- wall 1 step right and 4 step up: (1,4)
- wall 1 step right and 3 step up: (1,3)
- wall 1 step right and 2 step up: (1,2)
- wall 1 step right and 1 step up: (1,1)
- wall 1 step right: (1,0)
- wall 1 step right and 1 step down: (1,-1)
- wall 1 step right and 2 steps down: (1,-2)

So the vertical wall at x=1, from y=4 down to y=-2. So the player is at (0,0), needing to go to (4,4), but there's a wall blocking the path to the right. So the player can't go directly right. How else can they get to the key?

Alternatively, maybe manipulate the rules to make the wall not stop. For example, if we can change 'wall IS STOP' to something else, like 'wall IS PUSH' or remove the 'STOP' property. But to do that, we need to move the text blocks.

The 'wall IS STOP' rule is composed of the rule 'wall' at (-4,3), 'is' at (-5,3), and 'stop' at (-6,3). So these are three objects in a row. To break this rule, we can move any of them apart. If we move the 'stop' block to a different position, the rule is broken, so walls would no longer be stops. Then we could walk through them.

But how to reach those text blocks? The player is at (0,0), and the 'wall' rule is at (-4,3). That's four steps to the left and three steps up. So moving left four times and up three times would get there, but that's a long way, and along the way, are there any obstacles?

From (0,0), moving left once would be (-1,0). But are there walls there? The walls are only at x=1, so maybe moving left is possible. Let's check the walls listed. The walls are all at x=1, varying y. So the left side (x<1) is clear except for the rules. The rules for 'baba' are at (-4,2), 'is' at (-5,2), 'you' at (-6,2). So those are three blocks to the left and down from the 'wall' rule.

To reach the 'wall IS STOP' rule, the player would need to go left 4 steps (to x=-4) and up 3 steps. That's possible, but the path is clear. Let's see:

From (0,0):

1. left four times: (-4,0)
2. up three times: (-4,3)

But on the way up, are there any walls? The walls are all at x=1, so the path left to (-4,0) is clear. Then up to (-4,3) is also clear. So the player can reach the 'wall' rule's text blocks.

Once there, they can move the 'stop' block to break the 'wall IS STOP' rule, allowing walls to be passed. Then, the player could move through the vertical wall at x=1 and reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes the key pushable or something else. But first, breaking the 'wall IS STOP' seems essential.

Alternatively, the key is WIN, so if we can change the WIN rule to something else, but the key is already WIN. To change that, break the 'key IS WIN' rule. The 'key' rule is at (4,4), 'is' at (5,4), 'win' at (6,4). So moving any of those would break the rule. If we can move the 'win' block to become part of another rule, perhaps making 'key IS PUSH' or something, but that might not help.

Alternatively, create a rule 'BABA IS KEY' so that touching the key makes Baba win. But to do that, we need the 'baba', 'is', 'key' text blocks. The 'baba' rule is at (-4,2), 'is' at (-5,2), 'you' at (-6,2). So if we can replace 'you' with 'key', that would create 'BABA IS KEY', making the key interact with Baba.

But how to do that? The player needs to move the 'you' block (which is part of the 'BABA IS YOU' rule) and replace it with 'key'. So first, move the 'you' block. But to do that, the player needs to reach the 'baba' rule area.

The 'baba' rule is at (-4,2), 'is' at (-5,2), 'you' at (-6,2). So the player would need to go left 6 steps and up 2 steps from (0,0) to reach 'you' at (-6,2). That's a long way, but possible if walls aren't in the way. Since the only walls are at x=1, the path left is clear.

Once at (-6,2), the player can take the 'you' block and move it. Then place it next to the 'win' block in the 'key IS WIN' rule, creating 'key IS YOU', which might not help, but if we instead create 'BABA IS KEY', we need to move 'baba', 'is', and 'key' together.

This seems complicated. Maybe the easier path is to first break the 'wall IS STOP' rule by moving the 'stop' block. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move from (0,0) to (-4,3) to reach the 'wall' rule.
2. Move the 'stop' block away to break 'wall IS STOP'.
3. Now, walls are no longer stops, so the player can walk through them.
4. Go right past x=1 to reach the key at (4,4).

But how to move the 'stop' block? The player needs to be adjacent to it. The 'stop' block is at (-6,3). So from (-4,3), the player needs to move left two steps to (-6,3), pick up the 'stop' block, then move it somewhere else.

Wait, but the player is at (-4,3) after moving left four and up three. Then moving left two steps to (-6,3) where 'stop' is. But is there a wall between (-4,3) and (-6,3)? Checking the walls: all walls are at x=1, so the path is clear. So the player can move left to (-6,3), pick up 'stop', then move it. For example, move it down one step to (-6,4), breaking the 'wall IS STOP' rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stops. Then the player can go right past x=1. From (0,0), moving right would now be possible. But the key is at (4,4), which is northeast. So after breaking the wall rule, the player can move right towards x=1, then up.

But wait, after breaking 'wall IS STOP', the walls are still there but can be moved through. So the player can walk around them. So the path from (0,0) to (4,4) would be:

- Move right until x=1 (but walls are there, but no longer stops, so can pass through).
- Then move up to y=4, avoiding the walls at x=1.

Wait, the walls at x=1 are from y=4 down to y=-2. So if the player moves right to x=1, they can pass through the walls since they're no longer stops. Then move up along x=1 to y=4, but the key is at (4,4), which is to the right of x=1. So from x=1, the player can move right to x=4, passing through any non-stop objects.

But along the way, are there any other rules or objects? The key is at (4,4), with the 'key IS WIN' rule. Once the player reaches the key, since key is WIN, but the player is Baba, unless there's a rule making Baba WIN, touching the key would make the player win. Wait, in Baba Is You, if the object you're touching is WIN, then you win, provided you are not stopped. So if the player can reach the key, then they win.

But to reach the key, after breaking 'wall IS STOP', the player can move right past x=1, then up to y=4. However, the key is at (4,4), which is four steps right and four up from the player's starting position. But after breaking the wall rule, the player can move freely through the walls. So the path would be:

From (0,0):

1. Move up four times to reach (0,4).
2. Then move right four times to (4,4), which is the key's position.

But wait, moving up four times from (0,0) would reach (0,4). Then right four steps to (4,4). Along the way, are there any obstacles? The walls at x=1, but since they are no longer stops, the player can move through them. So yes, this path is possible.

But the initial problem is that the player might be blocked by other rules or objects. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to manipulate the rules first to become the WIN object.

Alternatively, after breaking 'wall IS STOP', the player can move to the key's location. But the key is part of the 'key IS WIN' rule. If the player can move the 'win' block from the 'key IS WIN' rule, then the key would no longer be WIN, and the player would need another way to win.

But perhaps the quickest solution is to break 'wall IS STOP', allowing movement through walls, then go straight to the key.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left four times to reach (-4,0).
2. Move up three times to reach (-4,3).
3. Move left two more steps to (-6,3) to get the 'stop' block.
4. Move the 'stop' block down to (-6,4), breaking the 'wall IS STOP' rule.
5. Now, walls can be passed.
6. Move right four times to (4,0).
7. Move up four times to (4,4), reaching the key.

But this requires moving the 'stop' block, which is part of the 'wall IS STOP' rule. By moving it away, the rule is broken, making walls not stops.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer way. Let's check the positions again.

The 'key' is at (4,4). The 'baba' rules are at (-4,2), (-5,2), (-6,2). The 'win' rule is part of 'key IS WIN' at (6,4). The 'stop' is at (-6,3).

Another approach: Create a rule 'BABA IS WIN' by rearranging the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' blocks. The 'baba' is at (-4,2), 'is' at (-5,2), 'you' at (-6,2). So to make 'BABA IS WIN', we need to replace 'you' with 'win'. 

To do that, the player would need to:

1. Move to (-6,2) to get the 'you' block.
2. Move it somewhere else.
3. Take the 'win' block from (6,4) and place it next to 'baba' and 'is'.

But moving the 'win' block from (6,4) to (-4,2) area is a long distance. The player would have to go from (0,0) to (6,4), which is six steps right and four up, but there's a wall at (1,4). However, if 'wall IS STOP' is still active, the player can't go through it. So this approach might not be feasible until we break the 'wall IS STOP' rule first.

So the order of operations would be:

1. Break 'wall IS STOP' to pass through walls.
2. Then either go to the key directly or create 'BABA IS WIN'.

But let's think about the immediate actions. The current position of the player is not specified, but based on the objects listed, perhaps the player is at (0,0). The key is at (4,4). The 'wall IS STOP' rule is at (-4,3), needing the player to move left four and up three to reach it.

But moving left four steps from the starting position would take the player to (-4,0), then up three to (-4,3). From there, moving left two more steps to (-6,3) to get the 'stop' block. Then moving it down to (-6,4), breaking the rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stops. Then the player can move right towards (4,4).

But how to execute this step by step in the game? The actions are single steps, so the player needs to make a series of moves. However, the assistant is to choose exactly one action based on the current observation, not the entire sequence. So the first action should be the initial step towards breaking the 'wall IS STOP' rule.

The first move would be to start moving left towards the 'stop' block. From the starting position (assuming (0,0)), the first action to reach the 'stop' block is to move left. So the chosen action is 'left'.

But wait, maybe there's","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this level in Baba Is You. The goal is usually to reach the ""WIN"" object, but since the current active rules say ""key is win"", the key is now the target. So I need to get to the key.

First, let's look at the map structure based on the observation. The active rules are:

- key is win: So the key is the thing we need to touch.
- wall is stop: Walls are solid and can't be passed through.
- baba is you: So I'm controlling Baba.

The objects on the map include several walls and the key positioned somewhere. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from Baba's starting position, right? Let me check the objects list again.

Looking at the objects:

There's a wall 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Then there's a rule `key` at 4 steps right and 4 up, followed by `is`, `win`, etc. Then a wall at 1 right and 3 up, the key at 2 right and 3 up. Then walls below that, down to 1 right and 2 steps down, etc. Also, there's a rule `baba` at 4 left, 2 down, with `is` and `you` next to it. So that forms the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule, which is already active.

The main obstacle here is the walls. The path from Baba's position to the key is blocked by walls. Let me visualize this. Baba is probably at the position where the rules for ""baba"" are placed, which is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 4 left, 2 down. But the actual Baba object is part of the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule. Maybe Baba's position is where the ""BABA"" text block is located? Or maybe the text blocks themselves are separate from the objects. Wait, in Baba Is You, the text blocks are part of the rules, and the objects are like Baba, Wall, Key, etc. So the rules are formed by text blocks, and the objects are the instances of those properties.

So, the key is at 2 right and 3 up. But there's a wall at 1 right and 3 up. Also, walls to the right at various positions down to 1 right and 1 step down. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall at 1 right, 3 up, which is directly in the way between Baba and the key.

Since the walls are ""stop"", I can't pass through them. So I need to move the key or find a way to bypass the wall. Alternatively, maybe change the rules to make the wall not stop or make myself able to pass through walls.

But how? Let's look at the available text blocks. There are several rule text blocks on the map:

- At 4 right,4 up: key, is, win (forming ""KEY IS WIN"")
- At 4 left,3 up: wall, is, stop (forming ""WALL IS STOP"")
- At 4 left,2 down: baba, is, you (forming ""BABA IS YOU"")

Additionally, there are other walls on the map.

So the key idea is to manipulate these text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can change ""WALL IS STOP"" to something else, like ""WALL IS PUSH"" or ""STOP IS NOTHING"", then the walls wouldn't block me. Alternatively, if I can make the key into something else that's win, or make myself able to move over stop.

But to move the text blocks, I need to be able to push them. In Baba Is You, you can push objects (including text blocks) if they are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So first, check if the text blocks are movable.

The current rules are ""wall is stop"", which means walls are stop. The text blocks are part of the map. The rule text blocks themselves are objects. So, for example, the ""key"" text block at 4 right,4 up—is that considered a wall? No, because the rules define that key is win. So the text blocks are separate objects. The properties are determined by the rules. So the text blocks for ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", etc., are objects that can be moved if they are not part of a ""STOP"" rule.

But looking at the active rules, ""wall is stop"", so any object that is a wall is stop. But the text blocks themselves are not walls; they are rule components. Wait, maybe the text blocks are considered separate from the objects. For example, if there's a wall object and a text block that says ""WALL IS STOP"", they are different. So perhaps the text blocks can be moved regardless of the current rules, as long as they are not themselves stopped.

But in the game, sometimes text blocks can't be moved if they are part of a rule that makes them stopped. Wait, no—the ""stop"" property applies to objects, not to text blocks. So the text blocks are objects that can be moved unless they are part of a rule that makes them stop. But in this case, the rules are ""wall is stop"", which affects wall objects, not the text blocks. So the text blocks (like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"") are separate objects and can be moved as long as they are not labeled as stop.

So, for example, the ""key"" text block at 4 right, 4 up can be moved because it's not stopped. Similarly, the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to it can be moved. The same with the other text blocks. So the plan is to move the text blocks to change the rules.

The goal is to get to the key, which is currently at 2 right and 3 up, but blocked by a wall at 1 right and 3 up. So how can I get past that wall?

Option 1: Make the wall not a stop. For example, change ""WALL IS STOP"" to something else. The ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is formed by the text blocks at 4 left,3 up: rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. If I can rearrange these text blocks to make a different rule, like ""STOP IS NOTHING"" or ""WALL IS YOU"", then walls would become passable or I could control them.

But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" text blocks. Let's see where they are located. The ""wall"" text block is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up. The ""is"" is 3 left and 3 up. The ""stop"" is 2 left and 3 up. So these are three adjacent text blocks forming the rule. To break this rule, I need to move at least one of them. But can I move them?

Since the current rules are ""wall is stop"", and the ""wall"" text block is part of a rule, but the text blocks themselves are not walls. Wait, the ""wall"" text block is an object that can be moved unless it's part of a rule that makes it stop. But since the rule is ""wall is stop"", does that affect the ""wall"" text block? No, the rule applies to wall objects, not the text blocks. So the ""wall"" text block is an object that can be moved unless it's stopped by another rule. Since the only rule related is ""wall is stop"", which makes wall objects stop, but the ""wall"" text block is a different object. So yes, the ""wall"" text block can be moved.

Therefore, I can move the ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" text blocks to change the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block to another position, the rule would become ""WALL IS [something else]"", which might make walls no longer stop.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""WALL IS PUSH"" or ""STOP IS KEY"" or something like that. But first, I need to see if I can move the necessary text blocks.

Another option is to change the ""key is win"" rule to make myself win. For example, if I can create a rule ""BABA IS WIN"", then touching Baba (which I control) would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks. However, the ""baba"" text block is at 4 left, 2 down, along with ""is"" and ""you"". The current rule there is ""BABA IS YOU"", which makes me controllable. If I change that to ""BABA IS WIN"", then I would become the win condition. But then I would need to reach my own position, which might be possible.

But first, let's focus on getting to the key. Let's see the path:

Baba is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. From there, looking at the map:

To the right, there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, but that's probably not directly in the way. The key is at 2 right and 3 up, blocked by a wall at 1 right and 3 up. So the immediate obstacle is the wall at 1 right, 3 up.

If I can make that wall not a stop, I could move around it. To do that, I need to break the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. The ""wall"" text block is at 4 left, 3 up. To get to that area, I need to move right. But moving right from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) would require moving through some obstacles.

Wait, let's map out the positions more clearly. Let's assume Baba's starting position is where the ""baba"" text block is: 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So:

- Current position: 4 left, 2 down (Baba's location)
- Objects around:
  - To the right (increasing the x-coordinate), there are walls at 1 right (at various y positions) up to 4 right,4 up where the ""key is win"" rules are.
  - The ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is at 4 left,3 up: so the ""wall"" text block is there, then ""is"" at 3 left,3 up, then ""stop"" at 2 left,3 up.

So to reach the ""wall"" text block at 4 left,3 up, I need to move right from 4 left to 4 left (same x) and up to 3 up. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. Let me think differently. Perhaps the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. For example, ""1 step to the right"" would be +1 in the x-direction, ""4 steps up"" is +4 in the y-direction.

Assuming that, Baba's position is (0,0). Then:

- The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left (x=-4) and 2 down (y=-2).
- The ""key"" rule is at 4 right (x=4) and 4 up (y=4).
- The ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is at 4 left (x=-4), 3 up (y=3).
- The key object itself is at 2 right (x=2), 3 up (y=3).

So the path from Baba (0,0) to the key (2,3) is blocked by a wall at (1,3).

So the direct path is right, right, up, up. But the wall at (1,3) is in the way. So how to get past it?

Option 1: Move the wall object. But walls are ""stop"", so I can't move them. So I need to change the rule that makes them stop.

Option 2: Change the key's position by moving the ""key is win"" rule. If I can move the ""key"" text block to be next to the actual key object, that wouldn't help because the key's win property is already set. Wait, the ""key is win"" rule is formed by the text blocks at (4,4): key, is, win. So if I move those text blocks, the rule changes. For example, if I make ""key is push"", then the key would be pushable, but that might not help.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, ""BABA IS STOP"" would make me stop, which is bad. ""BABA IS PUSH"" would let me push things. But to do that, I need to create a new rule.

But first, let's try to break the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. To do that, I need to move one of the text blocks in that rule: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"".

The ""wall"" text block is at (-4,3). To get there from Baba's position (0,0), I need to move left 4 steps and up 3 steps. But that's a long way, and there are walls along the way. For example, there's a wall at (1,4), but that's to the right. Wait, the walls on the map are:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up: (1,4)
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up: (1,3)
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up: (1,2)
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up: (1,1)
- wall 1 step to the right: (1,0)
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down: (1,-1)
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down: (1,-2)

So moving left from Baba's position (0,0) towards (-4,3) would require passing through x=-1, -2, -3, -4. But along the way, are there any walls? The walls are all at x=1, various y positions. So moving left from x=0 to x=-4 should be possible if there are no walls blocking that path. Wait, the other walls are all on the right side (x=1). So moving left should be clear. However, the ""baba"" text block is at (-4, -2), so moving left from (0,0) to (-4,3) would involve moving left 4 steps and up 3 steps. But along the way, are there any objects or rules that block movement?

The only obstacles are the walls on the right side (x=1). Since the agent (Baba) is at (0,0), moving left is possible unless there's a wall in the way. Since the walls are all at x=1, moving left from x=0 to x=-4 is open. So theoretically, Baba can move left, left, left, left, up, up, up.

But that's a long path. The question is, can Baba move left past those walls on the right? Wait, no—Baba is moving left, away from the walls. The walls are on the right side (x=1), so moving left would not encounter them. So yes, Baba can move left to (-4,3) where the ""wall"" text block is located.

So the plan is:

1. Move left 4 times to reach (-4,0), then up 3 times to reach (-4,3), where the ""wall"" text block is.

But wait, the ""wall"" text block is part of the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule at (-4,3). To break that rule, we need to move at least one of the text blocks. Let's see:

The ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is formed by three text blocks:

- ""wall"" at (-4,3)
- ""is"" at (-3,3)
- ""stop"" at (-2,3)

So if I can move one of these, the rule breaks. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block from (-2,3) to another position, the rule becomes ""WALL IS [nothing]"", which would mean walls are no longer stop.

To move the ""stop"" text block, I need to push it. Since ""stop"" is part of the rule, but the text blocks themselves are not stopped unless the rule says so. Wait, the rule is ""wall is stop"", which makes wall objects stop. The text blocks are separate. So the ""stop"" text block can be moved unless there's a rule that makes it stop. There isn't one here. So I can move the ""stop"" text block.

So the steps would be:

- Move left 4 steps to reach (-4,0).
- Move up 3 steps to reach (-4,3).
- Then move right to (-3,3) to get to the ""is"" text block.
- Then move right to (-2,3), which is the ""stop"" text block.
- Now, I can push the ""stop"" text block somewhere else. For example, move it down or left.

But where to move it? If I move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule, then the rule is broken. So if I move ""stop"" to, say, (-2,4), then the rule becomes ""WALL IS [nothing]"", so walls are no longer stop.

Once that's done, the walls are passable. Then I can go around the wall at (1,3) and reach the key.

Alternatively, after breaking the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule, I can move through the walls.

But let's think about the movement steps.

First, from Baba's starting position (0,0):

1. Move left four times to reach (-4,0).
2. Move up three times to reach (-4,3). But wait, moving up from (0,0) would be to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), etc. Wait, no—coordinates might be relative. Let me clarify.

Assuming that ""up"" increases the y-coordinate, and ""left"" decreases the x-coordinate. So starting at (0,0):

- Moving left once takes me to (-1,0).
- Moving left four times would take me to (-4,0).
- Then moving up three times would take me to (-4,3).

Along this path, are there any obstacles? The only walls are at x=1, so moving left from x=0 to x=-4 is clear. Then moving up from y=0 to y=3 is also clear as long as there are no walls in the way. But looking at the map, there are no walls reported in those areas. The walls on the map are all at x=1, so this path should be clear.

Once at (-4,3), the ""wall"" text block is there. Then I need to move","

I need to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let's look at the current observation again. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, my avatar is Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall (which stops me). The goal is usually to reach the key, but since key is win, touching the key would make me win. But how do I get there?

Looking at the objects on the map: There's a wall to the right in several positions, starting from 4 steps up down to 1 step down. Then, there's a key at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. The rules for key, is, and win are all grouped on the right side at 4 steps right and 4 up. The wall rule is on the left side at 4 left and 3 up, along with is and stop.

My goal is to reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are all to my right, so I need to find a way around them. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move unless stopped by a wall. But the walls are solid. How can I move past them?

Wait, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The key is win, so if I can make myself win, perhaps that's another way. But how? The active rules are key is win, so touching the key would make me win. But the path is blocked. Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" text block to be associated with Baba, then maybe just being Baba would be the win condition. Let me check where the ""win"" rule is. It's at 6 steps right and 4 steps up, next to the key and the ""is"" block. So the rule is ""key IS win"".

If I can break that rule, maybe I can make Baba the win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block away from the key. But to move anything, it has to not be stopped. The ""stop"" property is assigned to the rule ""wall IS stop"". So, any object or rule that's not stop can be moved. Let me see which objects are movable. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. The rules are key, is, win, wall, is again, stop, and is again. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 up. So that rule itself is a stop, meaning I can't move it. But other rules like key, is, win, wall can be moved if they're not part of a stop rule.

So the plan is to move the ""win"" text block so that instead of ""key IS win"", it becomes ""baba IS win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" block. Let's see where the ""baba"" rule is. It's at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, with ""is"" and ""you"" next to it. So the current rule is ""baba IS you"". If I can replace ""you"" with ""win"", that would make ""baba IS win"", making me win just by existing.

To do this, I need to move the ""win"" block from its current position (6 right, 4 up) to be next to the ""baba"" rule. But how do I get there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the map.

Starting from my current position (assuming I'm Baba, whose position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the rules, maybe at the ""baba"" rule location? The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left and 2 down. So maybe my position is there. Let's check the objects again.

The objects list includes ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"", which is a wall far up and to the right. The key is at 2 right and 3 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left and 2 down. So if I'm at the ""baba"" rule, I need to move to the ""win"" rule located at 6 right and 4 up. But the path is blocked by walls on the right.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""is"" block that's part of the ""key IS win"" rule. If I can break that rule, then key is no longer win, and perhaps I can create a new rule. But the key is still present; if I can make Baba the win, then reaching the key might not even be necessary.

So steps:

1. Move the ""win"" text block from 6 right, 4 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""win"" block is. But the way is blocked by walls on the right. How can I get past them?

Wait, the walls to the right are from 1 step right up to 1 step right down. So the right side is all walls except maybe below. But my position is at 4 left and 2 down (the ""baba"" rule). To get to the ""win"" block at 6 right and 4 up, I need to move right across the walls. But the walls are there, so I can't pass through them. Unless I can change their properties.

But the walls are defined by ""wall IS stop"". If I can remove the ""stop"" property from wall, they would become movable. But the ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up. To delete that rule, I would need to move the ""stop"" text block away, but that rule is a stop itself, so I can't move it. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a wall if it's not stopped. Wait, no—walls are stop, so they can't be pushed. So that's not possible.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I can reach it by moving around the walls using other rules. But how? The only movable objects are the rules (key, is, win, wall) that are not part of a stop rule. The ""stop"" rule is itself stopped, so I can't move it. The ""wall IS stop"" rule is at 4 left and 3 up. So the wall rule is there, making walls stop.

Wait, perhaps I can change the ""wall IS stop"" rule to something else. For example, if I can make wall not stop, then the walls would be movable, and I could push them out of the way. But to do that, I need to edit the ""wall IS stop"" rule. To edit a rule, I need to move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall IS"" part.

The ""wall IS stop"" rule is composed of ""rule 'wall' 4 left 3 up"", ""rule 'is' 3 left 3 up"", and ""rule 'stop' 2 left 3 up"". So to break this rule, I need to move either ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" away. But ""stop"" is part of the stop rule, so I can't move it. The ""is"" block is movable since it's not part of a stop. So if I move the ""is"" block from the ""wall IS stop"" rule, that would break the rule, making wall not stop.

So let's try that. If I move the ""is"" block that's at 3 left 3 up (part of the wall IS stop rule), then the wall would no longer be stop. Then the walls would be regular objects, and I could move them or push them. But how do I move that ""is"" block?

My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 left 2 down. To get to the ""is"" block at 3 left 3 up, I need to move right by 1 step, up by 1 step. Let's see if that's possible.

From the ""baba"" rule's position (4 left 2 down), moving right once would take me to 3 left 2 down. Then up once to 3 left 1 down. Then right again to 2 left 1 down. Wait, but the path might be blocked. Let me check the objects around that area.

Looking at the objects list, there are walls at various positions. For example, a wall is 1 step to the right and 4 up, which is far away. The walls closer to me: wall 1 step to the right and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, right, and 1 down. So from my position (assuming it's at 4 left 2 down), moving right would take me towards the walls on the right side. But moving left would be further away from the ""is"" block I need to reach.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let's recap:

Goal: Make Baba the win by creating ""baba IS win"".

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" block.

Current ""baba IS you"" rule is at 4 left 2 down, with ""is"" at 3 left 2 down and ""you"" at 2 left 2 down.

The ""win"" block is at 6 right 4 up. So I need to move that ""win"" block all the way to the left to connect with ""baba"" and ""is"".

But moving it requires traversing a path that's blocked by walls on the right. Unless I can make the walls movable by changing the ""wall IS stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing rules to push the walls. Wait, can I push walls? Since they are stop, I can't move them. But if I can make them not stop, then maybe.

So step 1: Break the ""wall IS stop"" rule by moving the ""is"" block from that rule.

The ""wall IS stop"" rule is at 4 left 3 up (wall), 3 left 3 up (is), 2 left 3 up (stop).

If I move the ""is"" block from 3 left 3 up to another position, the rule ""wall IS stop"" would break. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to move them.

To move the ""is"" block at 3 left 3 up, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. My current position is at 4 left 2 down. To reach 3 left 3 up, I need to move right once (to 3 left 2 down), then up once (to 3 left 1 down), then right again (to 2 left 1 down), then up again (to 2 left 0 down), then right again (to 1 left 0 down), then up (to 1 left -1 down), etc. But this path is probably blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think.

From 4 left 2 down:

Move right to 3 left 2 down.

Check if that's possible. Are there any walls there? The objects list includes wall 1 step to the right (assuming from the baba rule's position?), but not sure. The walls are mostly on the right side. So moving right from 4 left 2 down to 3 left 2 down might be possible if there's no wall there. If there's a wall, I can't move.

Assuming I can move right, then up to 3 left 1 down. Then right to 2 left 1 down. Then up to 2 left 0 down. Then right to 1 left 0 down. Then up to 1 left -1 down. This is getting complicated and likely blocked.

Maybe this approach isn't feasible. Let's think differently.

What if I don't change the ""wall IS stop"" rule but instead use the existing movable rules to create a path?

The ""key IS win"" rule is at 4 right 4 up. The ""win"" block is there. If I can move the ""win"" block to the ""baba"" rule, that would make ""baba IS win"".

To move the ""win"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""win"" block is at 6 right 4 up. My current position is at 4 left 2 down. The distance is quite far. How to get there?

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block from the ""key IS win"" rule to connect with the ""baba"" rule. The ""is"" block is at 5 right 4 up. If I can move that ""is"" block to be between ""baba"" and ""win"", that could form ""baba IS win"".

So steps:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 5 right 4 up to be next to the ""baba"" rule (4 left 2 down) and the ""win"" block (6 right 4 up).

But again, the path is blocked by walls on the right. How to get to the ""is"" block at 5 right 4 up?

This seems really challenging. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's check the current active rules again: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The key is at 2 right 3 up. If I can make the key not be win, then maybe the win condition is elsewhere. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself win by changing the ""you"" in ""baba IS you"" to ""win"". To do that, I need to replace the ""you"" block with ""win"". The ""you"" block is at 2 left 2 down. So if I move the ""win"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", that would create ""baba IS win"".

So the plan is:

- Move the ""win"" block (6 right 4 up) to be adjacent to the ""baba IS you"" rule (4 left 2 down).

To do this, I need to navigate from my current position (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location) to the ""win"" block, but the path is blocked by walls on the right.

Wait, maybe I can use the existing rules to move around. For example, if I can push a wall by changing its property. But since walls are stop, I can't push them.

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe I can reach it by moving around the walls using the rules. But how? The only movable things are the text blocks (key, is, win, wall) that are not stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. The key is a movable object because ""key is win"" but win isn't a stop property here. Wait, no—the key's property is win, which doesn't make it stop. So the key is movable. But to reach the key at 2 right 3 up, I need to get past the walls on the right.

Wait, the walls are all on the right side, from 1 step right up to 1 step right down. So my avatar is probably on the left side, near the ""baba"" rule. To get to the key at 2 right 3 up, I need to move right three steps, but each step is blocked by a wall. For example:

- From my position (4 left 2 down), moving right once would take me to 3 left 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects list, I see walls at 1 step right (various positions), but not specifically at 3 left 2 down. So maybe that's free.

Then moving right again to 2 left 2 down. Still no wall mentioned there. Then right to 1 left 2 down. There's a wall at 1 step right and 2 up, but that's up, not the same position. So maybe moving right three times gets me to 1 left 2 down, which is next to the key at 2 right 3 up. Wait, no, the key is at 2 right 3 up. So if I'm at 1 left 2 down, moving right once would be to 0 left 2 down (which is 1 right), but the key is at 2 right 3 up. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" block to the ""baba"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block from 6 right 4 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"". Let's see the positions:

- ""baba"" rule is at 4 left 2 down.
- ""is"" block for ""baba IS you"" is at 3 left 2 down.
- ""you"" is at 2 left 2 down.

The ""win"" block is at 6 right 4 up. To place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"", I need to move it all the way to the left. That's a long distance. Maybe there's a shorter path using other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block from the ""key IS win"" rule (at 5 right 4 up) to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". So moving that ""is"" block to between ""baba"" and ""win"".

But again, the path is blocked. Maybe I need to first break the ""wall IS stop"" rule to make walls movable, then push them out of the way. Let's try that approach.

To break ""wall IS stop"", I need to move the ""is"" block from 3 left 3 up. So from my current position (4 left 2 down), I need to move right, up, etc., to reach 3 left 3 up.

Step-by-step movement:

1. From 4 left 2 down, move right to 3 left 2 down.
2. Move up to 3 left 1 down.
3. Move right to 2 left 1 down.
4. Move up to 2 left 0 down.
5. Move right to 1 left 0 down.
6. Move up to 1 left -1 down.
7. Move right to 0 left -1 down (which is 1 right).
8. Move up to 0 left 0 down (which is same as right).
9. Continue moving right and up until reaching 3 left 3 up.

But this seems impractical due to possible walls in the way. Additionally, each move might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different rule to manipulate. For example, the ""key IS win"" rule. If I can make the key not win, then the win condition might be elsewhere. But how?

If I can break the ""key IS win"" rule by moving the ""win"" block away, then the key would just be a key. But the win condition might still be elsewhere. Alternatively, if I can make ""baba"" the win, that would solve it.

Another idea: Use the ""win","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but the active rules say ""key is win"" right now. So instead of reaching Baba (which is you), I need to get the key. But then, ""wall is stop,"" meaning walls block movement.

Looking at the map, the key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up from where I probably start. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout. The right side has a wall all the way up from 1 step right down to 1 step right and 1 step down. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, which is next to a wall. Hmm. So maybe I need to move that key to a different position or change the rules to bypass the walls.

Wait, there are some rules on the left side. There's a rule that says ""rule 'baba' 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down,"" which probably forms part of the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule. If I can move those text blocks, maybe I can change the rules. The key is win, so if I can make the key something else, like a YOU, then I could turn into the key. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can take ""key is win"" and split it into ""key is"" and ""win,"" then maybe I can make ""baba is win"" so that reaching Baba makes me win. But I need to move the text blocks without stepping on walls.

Looking at the positions of the rules: the ""key is win"" rule is at 4 right, 4 up; ""is"" at 5 right, 4 up; ""win"" at 6 right, 4 up. To break this rule, I would need to move those text blocks. But first, I need to get to them. The problem is that moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the start point, maybe near the lower right walls) might be blocked by walls. Let me check the objects again.

There's a wall 1 step right at various positions, so moving right directly might be blocked. The key is at 2 right, 3 up. Maybe I can go up and right from there. But how to get past the walls? The walls on the right are continuous, so perhaps I need to use other objects or rules to override the stop property.

Wait, since ""wall is stop,"" but if I can change that rule, maybe I can make walls passable. For example, if I can create a ""wall is not stop"" rule, but I don't have the text blocks for that. The existing rules on the left include ""rule 'wall' 4 left, 3 up"", ""rule 'is' 3 left, 3 up"", and ""rule 'stop' 2 left, 3 up"". So the rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by those three blocks. If I can move those blocks, I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable.

But how to get to those blocks? They're 4 steps left and 3 up from the key's position. Let me see. If I start at the key's position (2 right, 3 up), moving left 4 steps would take me to 4 left, same y-coordinate. But the path might be blocked. There's a wall 1 step right at various positions, but moving left from the key's position, maybe there's a clear path. Let me think: from key at 2r,3u, moving left 4 steps would be 4l,3u. Is there a wall there? The objects listed include ""rule 'wall' 4 step to the left and 3 step up"", which is exactly that position. So that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But to get there, I need to move left from the key. However, moving left from the key's position (2r,3u) to 4l,3u would require passing through 1l,3u, 0,3u, etc. Are there walls in that path? The map shows walls at 1 step right and 3 step up, which is the same y as the key but 1 step right. So moving left from 2r,3u, the next position is 1l,3u—no wall there? The objects listed have walls at 1r,3u, 1r,4u, etc. So maybe moving left from the key is possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule 'you'"" block from the lower left. The rule ""baba is you"" is at 4l,2d; ""is"" at 3l,2d; ""you"" at 2l,2d. If I can move the ""you"" block, maybe I can attach it to the key to make ""key is you"". Then, since I'm Baba (you), I could become the key by touching it. But how to do that?

First, I need to grab the ""you"" block. To move any object, it can't be STOP. The ""you"" block is part of a rule, but since the rule is ""baba is you"", and ""wall is stop"", but the ""you"" text block itself isn't stop. So maybe I can move it. Let's see: the ""you"" block is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the baba rule. So if I can get to that position, I can pick up the ""you"" block.

But how to get there? Let's assume my current position is at the starting point, perhaps near the lower right where the walls are. Let me try to map the path. Starting at, say, position (0,0), but the exact coordinates might not matter as much as the relative steps. The key is at 2 right, 3 up. To get there, maybe move up 3 steps and right 2 steps. But the path is blocked by walls on the right. So perhaps I need to go around via the left side.

Alternatively, use the existing rules to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block from the key's rule (5r,4u) and the ""win"" block (6r,4u), maybe I can form a new rule like ""baba is win"", making touching Baba make me win. But to do that, I need to move those blocks to near the ""baba"" rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4l,2d. So if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks from the upper right to near the baba rule, I can create ""baba is win"". Let's see: the ""is"" block is at 5r,4u. To get to 4l,2d, I need to move left 9 steps and down 2 steps. That seems impossible because of the walls in the way. The right side has walls all the way, so moving left from 5r,4u would pass through 4r,4u (which is a rule 'key' block), then 3r,4u (a rule 'is' block), then 2r,4u (empty?), then 1r,4u (wall), so stuck.

Hmm. Another approach: Since the key is win, if I can grab the key and bring it to the position where the ""win"" rule is, but the key is an object, and I need to be able to move it. However, the key might be movable unless there's a ""stop"" rule on it. The active rules don't say key is stop, so I can probably move it.

So the plan is: move to the key's position (2r,3u), pick it up, and then bring it to the ""win"" rule's position (6r,4u). But how to get there without being blocked by walls? The path from key to win is through the upper right, but there are walls at 1r,4u; 1r,3u; etc. Maybe if I can make walls passable by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule.

To change ""wall is stop"", I need to move the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' blocks that form that rule. The 'wall' rule is at 4l,3u; 'is' at 3l,3u; 'stop' at 2l,3u. If I can move these blocks, I can break the rule. Let's see: those blocks are on the left side. To reach them, I might need to navigate from the key's position to the left.

From the key at 2r,3u, moving left 4 steps would get to 4l,3u (the 'wall' rule). But the path would be 2r,3u → 1l,3u → 0,3u → -1,3u, etc. Are there walls in between? The map shows walls at 1r,3u, but moving left from 2r,3u to 1l,3u is clear. Then from 0,3u, is there a wall? Not mentioned, so maybe passable. Then to 4l,3u, which is the 'wall' rule. If I can move that block, then the 'wall is stop' rule is broken.

So steps could be:

1. Move from starting position to key's location (2r,3u).
2. Pick up the key.
3. Move left to 4l,3u (the 'wall' rule block).
4. Move the 'wall' block somewhere else to break the 'wall is stop' rule.
5. Now walls are passable, so navigate around them to the 'win' rule or create a new rule.

Alternatively, after breaking 'wall is stop', move the 'key is win' rule to make 'baba is win', so touching Baba wins.

But maybe a simpler solution: since the key is win, if I can pick up the key and bring it to where the 'win' rule is, but the 'win' rule is at 6r,4u, which is up and to the right. However, moving right from the key's position is blocked by walls. But if walls are no longer stop, then I can go through them.

Wait, but how to get to the 'win' rule's position? Let's think. If I have the key and walls are passable, I can move right through the walls. So from key at 2r,3u, move right through the walls at 1r,3u, 1r,2u, etc., up to 6r,4u where the 'win' rule is. But the key is an object; do I need to carry it? Since the rule is 'key is win', having the key makes me win, but only if I'm the subject. Since I'm Baba (you), touching the key would make me win because key is win. But if I can move the key to a position where I can reach it without being blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like 'baba is win' by moving the 'is' and 'win' blocks from the key's rule to the baba rule.

The 'baba' rule is at 4l,2d. The 'is' block is at 5r,4u, and 'win' at 6r,4u. To get those to the baba rule's position, I'd have to move them left 9 steps and down 2 steps, which is impractical due to walls.

Another angle: The 'rule 'baba' 4 step to the left and 2 steps down' is part of the 'baba is you' rule. If I can change that to 'baba is win', then touching Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'you' block from the 'baba is you' rule to 'win'.

The 'you' block is at 2l,2d. If I can move that block to the 'win' position (6r,4u), then combining with 'baba is' would make 'baba is win'. So steps:

1. Move to the 'you' block at 2l,2d.
2. Pick it up.
3. Move it to the 'win' rule's position (6r,4u).
4. Now, the rule would be 'baba is win', so touching Baba makes me win.

But how to get to those positions without being blocked? Let's see:

From the starting position (assuming near the lower right walls), moving left to reach the 'you' block at 2l,2d. The path would be through open spaces since the walls are on the right. Once there, pick up 'you' and move right to 6r,4u. However, moving right from 2l,2d would pass through 3r,2d, 4r,2d, etc., but there are walls at 1r, various positions. Wait, the walls on the right are at 1r,4u; 1r,3u; 1r,2u; 1r,1u; 1r; 1r,1d. So moving right from 2l,2d, you'd go through 3r,2d (no wall mentioned), then 4r,2d (rule 'baba' is there?), no, the 'baba' rule is at 4l,2d. So moving right from 2l,2d to 6r,4u would require moving right and up, but there are walls at 1r, upper levels. However, if 'wall is stop' is removed, then walls are passable. But to get there, I need to first remove the 'wall is stop' rule by moving its blocks.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move from starting position to the key at 2r,3u.
2. Grab the key.
3. Move left to the 'wall is stop' rule blocks (4l,3u, 3l,3u, 2l,3u).
4. Move the 'wall' block at 4l,3u to a different position, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.
5. Now walls are passable.
6. Navigate through the right side walls (which are now passable) to the 'win' rule at 6r,4u.
7. Alternatively, create a new rule by moving 'is' and 'win' to make 'baba is win'.

Alternatively, after making walls passable, go to the 'baba is you' rule and change 'you' to 'win'.

But maybe the simplest way is to create 'baba is win' by moving the 'you' block from the 'baba is you' rule to the 'win' rule.

So steps:

- Move to the 'you' block at 2l,2d.
- Pick it up.
- Move it to the position where 'win' is, which is 6r,4u.
- Now, combining with the 'baba is' rule at 4l,2d, you'd have 'baba is win', making touching Baba win.

But how to move the 'you' block there? The path from 2l,2d to 6r,4u requires moving right 8 steps and up 2 steps. However, there are walls at 1r, various positions. But if walls are now passable (after breaking 'wall is stop'), then movement is possible. So:

1. Break 'wall is stop' by moving its blocks.
2. Move 'you' block to 6r,4u.
3. Create 'baba is win' rule.
4. Then, just go to Baba and touch him to win.

But first, I need to execute these steps. Let's try to detail the actions.

First, to break 'wall is stop':

- The 'wall' rule is at 4l,3u. Need to move that block. To do that, move left from the key's position (2r,3u) to 4l,3u. Let's see the path:

From 2r,3u (key's position), move left 4 steps: 1l,3u → 0,3u → -1,3u → -2,3u → -3,3u (4 steps left). But the objects listed don't mention walls on the left side except the ones related to rules. Assuming movement is possible leftwards without walls, then yes.

Once at 4l,3u, pick up the 'wall' block and move it somewhere else, say, 4l,3u + up 1 step to 4l,4u. This would break the 'wall is stop' rule.

Then, walls are no longer stop. Now, navigate to the 'you' block at 2l,2d.

From 4l,3u, move left 2 steps to 2l,3u, then down 1 step to 2l,2d (the 'you' block's position).

Pick up the 'you' block, then move right 8 steps and up 2 steps to 6r,4u (the 'win' rule's position). This might require moving through the now-passable walls on the right.

Once there, place the 'you' block next to 'baba is' at 4l,2d and 'win' at 6r,4u, forming 'baba is win'.

Now, as Baba (you), touching Baba would make you win. So just move to where Baba is (probably near the lower right area) and touch him.

But wait, where is Baba located? The objects listed include ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"", which is the 'baba' text block, not the actual Baba object. The Baba object is implied to be where the 'baba' rule is applied, but in the observation, there's no explicit Baba object mentioned. Maybe the Baba is at the position of the 'baba' rule, or perhaps the player starts as Baba at a specific location.

Assuming the player is at the starting position near the lower right walls, after creating 'baba is win', moving to that area and touching the 'baba' text block (or the implied Baba icon) would make the player win.

Putting this all together into actions:

1. Move left from key to break 'wall is stop'.
2. Grab 'you' block.
3. Move 'you' to 'win' position.
4. Navigate to Baba and win.

But the problem is translating this into the specific actions (up, down, left, right, idle) given the","

4,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but right now the key is labeled as WIN. So maybe I need to get the key first. But there are walls everywhere labeled as STOP. How do I move past them?

Looking at the active rules: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. Since ""baba is you,"" that means I can move wherever Baba is. But I need to figure out where Baba is located. The map description mentions some rule blocks. Specifically, there's a rule `baba` 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that ""baba"" rule block, maybe I can change the rules.

But wait, moving objects is only possible if they're not STOP. The wall rules are stop, so most walls can't be moved. But the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", etc., can they be moved? The rules say that if something is STOP, you can't move it. But the text blocks themselves—are they considered objects or part of the rules? I think in Baba Is You, the text blocks that make up the rules are movable unless they're part of a STOP rule. Since wall is stop, but the ""wall"" text block itself isn't necessarily STOP unless it's part of a rule like ""wall is stop"".

Looking at the objects list, there are several wall objects and rule blocks. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. The WIN is the same as the key. So the key is both a key and the win condition. But I need to get to it, but there's a wall right next to me (1 step to the right). Since wall is stop, I can't pass through it. So how do I get past?

Maybe I can move the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" or something like that, then touching the key would make me win. Let me see the rule locations.

The ""baba"" rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" is 3 left and 2 down, and ""you"" is 2 left and 2 down. So combining those, the rule ""baba is you"" is formed. If I can rearrange those blocks to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"", then I would be win, and touching anything (including the wall?) might let me pass. But how?

First, I need to move the ""baba"" rule block. Let's see where I am. The current position isn't explicitly stated, but the walls are all aligned to the right. Maybe I'm to the left of all these walls. The rule blocks for ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" are 4, 3, and 2 steps left respectively, 2 steps down. So if I can move the ""you"" block from 2 left, 2 down to another position, maybe I can form a new rule.

Alternatively, the key is at 2 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move up and right, but there's a wall at 1 right, 4 up. Then at 1 right, 3 up, another wall. So path is blocked. But maybe if I change the ""key is win"" rule, perhaps turning it into ""key is stop"", then the key becomes a stop, which I can't step on, but that might not help. Or reversing the rule, like ""win is key"", which would mean that wherever the key is, that's the win condition. But I still need to get to the key.

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"". So the key is both a key and the win object. If I can move the key to a different location, maybe that's not necessary. But the key object is separate from the rule. The rule ""key is win"" is a text block, not the key object itself. So moving the key object to another spot might not change the rule. Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can make a new rule like ""baba is win"", then touching any object (including the key) would make me win. So how to do that? The existing rule blocks for ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" are at 4 left, 2 down; 3 left, 2 down; and 2 left, 2 down. So if I can move the ""you"" block from 2 left, 2 down to where the ""win"" rule is, then combine them.

Wait, the ""win"" rule is 6 steps right and 4 up. That's far away. Maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" blocks are located towards the left and down. If I can move those blocks to form a new rule, say ""baba is win"", then I can become win.

So first, I need to move the ""baba"" rule block. To do that, I need to navigate to its position, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from where I am. But I don't know my current position. The map description lists objects relative to certain positions. Looking at the wall at 1 step right and 4 up, maybe the player (Baba) is to the left of these walls.

Assuming I'm to the left, moving right towards the walls. But the first wall is 1 step right, 4 up. Since wall is stop, I can't move through it. So I need to find a way around. Maybe by rearranging the rules.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to a different location, but that might not help. The key is at 2 right, 3 up. Maybe if I can push the key to a different spot, but the key is an object. Can I move it? The active rules don't say that key is movable. The only movable things are objects that aren't STOP. Since wall is stop, but key isn't defined as stop. Wait, the rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"". So key is win, which might mean it's a win object, but not necessarily stop. So maybe I can move the key.

If I can move the key to where I am, then I could just grab it, but the key is at 2 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls blocking the path. Let's see the path:

From current position (unknown), but assuming I'm to the left of the walls. Let's say I'm at position (0,0). Then the wall at 1 right, 4 up is at (1,4). The key is at (2,3). The way there is blocked by walls at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), etc. So moving up from (0,0) to (0,1), then right to (1,1), but there's a wall at (1,1). So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the walls by changing their rules. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 4 left, 3 up. If I can change that rule to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, then the walls might become movable. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" text block or the ""stop"" text block.

The ""wall"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. The ""is"" next to it is at 3 left, 3 up. The ""stop"" is at 2 left, 3 up. So the rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can move the ""stop"" to a different position, making the rule something else, like ""wall is push"", then walls wouldn't be stop. But how to do that?

To move the ""stop"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move it down or left or right, that might help. But to get to that position, I might need to navigate through other objects.

Alternatively, focus on the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can change that to ""baba is win"", then I would be win, allowing me to pass through walls. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""is"" is at 3 left, 2 down. ""you"" is at 2 left, 2 down. So if I can move the ""you"" block from 2 left, 2 down to where the ""win"" rule is, then combine them.

The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 4 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule? No, the only active rule for win is ""key is win"". So the ""win"" text block is part of that rule at 6 right, 4 up.

Alternatively, create a new ""baba is win"" rule by taking the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks. The ""baba"" is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""is"" is at 3 left, 2 down. The ""win"" is at 6 right, 4 up. So I would need to move these blocks together.

But moving them would require pathing. Let's think step by step.

First, move the ""you"" block (part of ""baba is you"") to a new position. If I can make ""baba is win"", then I become win. To do that, I need to replace ""you"" with ""win"" in the rule.

The current ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. To form ""baba is win"", I need to place ""win"" after ""is"". The current setup is ""baba"" - ""is"" - ""you"". So if I move the ""you"" to the position after ""is"", and replace it with ""win"", that would work.

But how to do that? The ""you"" block is at 2 left, 2 down. The ""is"" is at 3 left, 2 down. So maybe move the ""you"" block one step to the right, next to the ""is"", and then replace it with the ""win"" block. But where is the ""win"" block? It's at 6 right, 4 up. That's far away. Maybe there's another ""win"" block? No, the only win rule is ""key is win"".

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" text block from the ""key is win"" rule. That ""win"" is at 6 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move multiple steps right and up, but there are walls blocking the path.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. The key is at 2 right, 3 up, and it's the win object. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are all to the right, 1 step right at various levels. Maybe if I can make the walls passable by changing their rule.

The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 4 left, 3 up. If I can move that ""stop"" to a different position, making the rule ""wall is *something else*"", then walls wouldn't be stop. For example, if I make ""wall is push"", then walls can be moved. But how?

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""stop"" is at 2 left, 3 up. Let's assume my current position is near there. If I can move ""stop"" to the right, then the rule becomes ""wall is [something else]"". For example, if I move ""stop"" one step to the right, next to ""is"" at 3 left, 3 up, then the rule would be ""wall is [empty]"" which might delete the rule, or make it ""wall is"" which is invalid. Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" text block from 4 left, 3 up. But ""wall"" is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""wall"" block, then the rule would be broken. For example, moving ""wall"" to the right next to ""is"", making ""is stop"" which doesn't make sense. But maybe that would remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

If I remove ""wall is stop"", then walls are no longer stop. So I could move through them. But how to do that?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 4 left, 3 up; ""is"" at 3 left, 3 up; ""stop"" at 2 left, 3 up. To break this rule, I need to move at least one of these blocks.

Let's say I move the ""stop"" block one step to the left. Then the rule would be ""wall is [nothing]"", which would deactivate ""wall is stop"". Now walls are not stop, so I can push them or move through them. But can I move the ""stop"" block?

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""stop"" is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can reach that position, I can move it. How do I get there?

Assuming I'm starting somewhere to the right of these blocks, but the walls are blocking the path. This is getting confusing. Maybe another approach: since the key is win, and it's located at 2 right, 3 up, maybe I can push the walls out of the way by changing their properties.

If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then I might be able to move the walls. But again, need to move the text blocks.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""push is stop"" or something, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is at 2 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule to be under Baba, then maybe I become win. But ""key is win"" is a rule, not an object. The key object is separate. So unless the rule is applied to me, it won't help.

Alternatively, if I can make a rule ""baba is key"", then I would be a key, and since key is win, touching anything would make me win. But how to create that rule.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. ""is"" at 3 left, 2 down. ""key"" is at 4 right, 4 up. So to make ""baba is key"", I need to move the ""key"" block to the right of ""is"". That would require moving the ""key"" block from 4 right, 4 up to, say, 1 right, 2 down (where the ""baba is you"" rule is). But that's a long way.

Alternatively, use the existing ""key"" text block from the ""key is win"" rule. That ""key"" is at 4 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls. For example, from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point left of the walls), moving right 4 steps would hit the wall at 1 right, 4 up. Then up from there, but walls are blocking.

This is really challenging. Maybe I need to focus on moving the ""baba"" rule blocks to create ""baba is win"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. ""is"" at 3 left, 2 down. ""you"" at 2 left, 2 down. If I can move the ""you"" to the position where ""win"" is, which is 6 right, 4 up, but that's too far. Alternatively, use the ""win"" from the ""key is win"" rule.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block from 6 right, 4 up to near the ""baba is you"" rule. That would require moving it left and down, but again, pathing is blocked by walls.

I think the key here is to realize that by rearranging the ""baba is you"" rule into ""baba is win"", I can become win. So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""you"" block (part of ""baba is you"") to a new position.
2. Replace it with the ""win"" block from the ""key is win"" rule.
3. Form the new rule ""baba is win"".

But how to do this given the current positions?

The ""you"" block is at 2 left, 2 down. The ""win"" block is at 6 right, 4 up. That's a distance of 8 steps right and 2 steps up. Not feasible to move directly.

Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" in the ""key is win"" rule. The ""win"" there is part of the rule, but maybe I can detach it and move it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, when you move a text block that's part of a rule, you break the rule unless you move all parts. For example, the ""key is win"" rule is made of three blocks: ""key"", ""is"", ""win"". If I move the ""win"" block to another position, the rule remains as ""key is"", which is invalid, effectively deleting the rule.

But maybe that's useful. If I can delete the ""key is win"" rule, then the key is no longer win. But then the original goal might change. However, the active rules still have ""key is win"", so the key remains win.

Alternatively, create a new ""baba is win"" rule by moving the necessary blocks. Let's see:

Current ""baba is you"" rule: ""baba"" (4 left, 2 down), ""is"" (3 left, 2 down), ""you"" (2 left, 2 down).

To make ""baba is win"", need to replace ""you"" with ""win"". So move the ""you"" block away and bring the ""win"" block next to ""is"".

But where is the ""win"" block? It's at 6 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but the path is blocked by walls. For example, from the ""you"" block at 2 left, 2 down, moving right would take me into areas with walls.

This seems impossible. Maybe there's another approach. What if I make the key into Baba? If I can create a rule ""key is baba"", then the key would become Baba, and since Baba is you, touching the key would make me you. But that doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, make the key a YOU object. If I create ""key is you"", then the key becomes you, and touching it would make","

5,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The problem is that I need to figure out a valid action in the Baba Is You game based on the current observation. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key. But since the key is set as win, I need to get to it.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up from the current position. There are walls in various positions to the right and some rules below. The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, which isn't explicitly mentioned, but based on the rules, the rule 'baba is you' is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from one of the walls. Maybe the player is adjacent to that rule?

The main challenge is the walls that are marked as 'stop'. The wall is stop, so any object that's a wall can't be moved through. The path to the key might be blocked by these walls. Let me visualize the map:

The key is at (right 2, up 3). To get there, I need to move right twice and up three times. But between the starting position and the key, there are walls at 1 step right, 2 steps right, 3 steps right, 4 steps right up, etc. Also, there are some rules below at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can manipulate those rules to create a new path.

The rules that are present near the bottom are 'rule baba', 'rule is', and 'rule you' 4 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move these text blocks to form a new rule, perhaps I can change 'baba' to something else, like 'win' or 'push', which might help me bypass the walls.

For example, if I can create a rule like 'baba is push', then maybe I can push the walls out of the way. Alternatively, changing 'wall is stop' to 'wall is' would remove the stop property, making walls passable. Or maybe 'baba is win' would let me touch the key and win immediately, but the active rule already says 'baba is you', so I need to first destroy that rule or create a new one.

Let's check the positions of the text blocks. The 'key' rule is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. The 'is' and 'win' rules are next to it. To form a new rule, I need to combine a subject, 'is', and a property. The key is already set as win, but if I can move the 'win' rule to another position and create a new rule like 'baba is win', that could make Baba himself the win condition. But how to do that?

First, I need to move the existing rules. The 'baba is you' rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach that area, I have to move left 4 steps and down 2, but there are walls to the right that might be blocking. Wait, the walls to the right are all marked as stop, so I can't go through them. Unless I can push them by making Baba a pusher.

But to push, I need a rule that says 'baba is push'. To create that, I need to take the 'push' text block. However, looking at the current objects, there's no 'push' rule mentioned. The available rules are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you. So I need to form a new rule using these.

The existing rules that can be moved are the ones in the upper right: key, is, win. And the ones below: baba, is, you. If I can move the 'you' from below to the 'baba is' rule, maybe I can change it to 'baba is win'. Let's see the positions:

The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. 'is' is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. 'you' is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I move the 'you' to the right next to 'baba' and 'is', I can form 'baba is you', which is already the case. But to make 'baba is win', I need to replace 'you' with 'win'.

The 'win' rule is 6 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far. To get there, I'd have to move right 6 times and up 4, but there are walls blocking the path. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule down to the area where the 'baba' rule is.

Wait, the 'win' rule is part of the existing key is win rule. If I can detach 'win' from 'key' and attach it to 'baba', that would make sense. To do that, I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is'. But the 'win' is currently 6 steps right and 4 steps up. That's a long way. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, use the existing 'key is win' rule. Since the key is the win object, if I can get Baba to the key, that would win the level. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are all to the right, 1 step up to 4 steps up. So maybe I need to remove the 'stop' property from the walls.

The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Or change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is'. How?

The 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the 'wall' rule at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, 'is' at 3 steps left and 3 steps up, and 'stop' at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. To change this, I need to replace 'stop' with another property. But where is the 'push' or 'lose' or other property?

Alternatively, create a new rule 'wall is' by removing the 'stop' part. But I need the 'is' and 'wall' rules adjacent. The 'wall' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, 'is' at 3 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move the 'is' to another position, then combine 'wall' with a different property.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think step by step.

Current active rules:
1. key is win
2. wall is stop
3. baba is you

Goals:
- Reach the key (which is win), but blocked by walls.

Possible actions:
1. Move the 'stop' property from walls to something else, making walls passable.
2. Change Baba's property to allow pushing walls.
3. Make Baba himself the win condition so touching the key wins.

For option 1: To change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is', I need to remove the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that 'stop' block away, then the wall rule would just be 'wall is', making walls not stop. But how to move 'stop'? I need to be able to move text blocks that are not stop. Since walls are stop, I can't push them, but maybe other objects?

Baba is 'you', so I can move. The text blocks that are not stop are the ones not under 'wall is stop'. The 'key', 'is', 'win', 'baba', 'is', 'you' rules. These can be moved. So I need to move the 'stop' text block.

The 'stop' is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. To move it, I have to step on it and move in a direction. But since I'm Baba (you), and the path might be blocked, I need to navigate there.

The position of the player (Baba) isn't explicitly stated, but the 'baba is you' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. Assuming Baba is adjacent to that rule, maybe 1 step right and 1 step up from there. Let's say Baba is at position (0,0), and the 'baba is you' rule is at (-4, -2). To reach the 'stop' at (-2, -3), I need to move right 2 steps and down 1 step. But the way might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, perhaps Baba is at a different starting position. This is a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the rules' positions, maybe the player is to the left of the 'baba is you' rule.

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up from wherever Baba is. If I can move the key to another position, but the key's rule is 'key is win', so moving the key would still keep it as win if the rule remains.

Wait, the key object is separate from the rule. The rule says 'key is win', so the key's position is 2 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to path through the walls. However, the walls are stop, so I can't pass through them. Unless I can push them.

To push a wall, I need to be a pusher. So if I can create a 'baba is push' rule, then I can push walls. To create that, I need the 'push' text block. But there's no 'push' rule in the current objects. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

Wait, the 'is' and 'you' are text blocks. So maybe I can form a new rule by moving 'baba', 'is', and 'push' (but there's no 'push' rule). Alternatively, use existing rules. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then touching the key (which is win) would make me win. But how?

The current rules are 'key is win', so the key is win. If I can make Baba be win, then I would win just by existing. But the active rule is 'baba is you', so I need to change that. To do that, I need to destroy the 'baba is you' rule or create a new one.

To destroy a rule, you have to move the text blocks apart. The 'baba is you' rule is made of three blocks: 'baba' at 4 left 2 down, 'is' at 3 left 2 down, 'you' at 2 left 2 down. If I can move one of these blocks away, the rule is broken. For example, moving the 'you' block to another position would break 'baba is you', allowing me to create a new rule.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the 'you' block from the 'baba is you' rule to form a new rule, like 'baba is win'.
   - To do this, I need to move the 'you' block next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'you' is currently at 2 left 2 down. If I move it to the right next to 'is' (which is at 3 left 2 down), then combining 'baba' (4 left 2 down), 'is' (3 left 2 down), and 'you' (now 4 left 2 down?) Wait, positions might be relative. This is getting a bit unclear without knowing the exact grid layout.

Alternatively, consider that each text block has a position. The 'baba' rule is 4 steps left and 2 down. The 'is' is 3 left 2 down. The 'you' is 2 left 2 down. So they are adjacent horizontally. To form a new rule, say 'baba is win', I need to move the 'win' block (which is 6 right 4 up) near them.

But that's a long distance. Maybe instead, use the existing 'key is win' rule. The 'key' is 4 right 4 up, 'is' 5 right 4 up, 'win' 6 right 4 up. If I can move the 'win' block down to the area of the 'baba' rule.

For example, move the 'win' block left 6 steps and down 4 steps to reach the 'baba' area. But that's impossible manually; the game likely allows moving one step at a time.

Alternatively, break the 'key is win' rule by moving the 'win' block away, then create a new rule 'baba is win'.

But this requires navigating to the 'win' block, which is far to the right and up.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' is at 2 left 3 up. If I can move that 'stop' block to another position, say next to a wall, making the wall not stop. For example, create 'wall is' instead of 'wall is stop'. That would remove the stop property from walls.

To do this, I need to take the 'stop' block and move it away, then combine 'wall' and 'is' with another property. But there's no other property nearby except maybe 'win' or 'key', but those are part of their own rules.

Alternatively, create 'wall is push' or something, but that might not help.

Another angle: Since the key is win, and it's located at 2 right 3 up, maybe I can push a wall out of the way to access the key. For that, I need to be a pusher. So creating 'baba is push' is essential.

To create 'baba is push', I need the 'push' text block. But there isn't one. However, maybe using existing rules. Wait, the 'key is win' rule has a 'win' block. If I can move 'win' to form 'baba is win', that would make Baba win, but the key is already win. Alternatively, 'baba is push' would require a 'push' block, which isn't present.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and it's adjacent to a wall, perhaps I can destroy the wall by changing its property. For example, if I can make the wall not stop, then I can walk through it.

To remove 'stop' from the wall, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 4 left 3 up, 'is' at 3 left 3 up, 'stop' at 2 left 3 up. If I move the 'stop' block away, the rule becomes 'wall is', making walls passable.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'stop' block from 2 left 3 up to another position.
2. Then, move through the walls to reach the key.

But how to move the 'stop' block? I need to be able to move it. Since 'wall is stop', and walls are stop, I can't push them. But the 'stop' block itself is a text block. Since the 'stop' property is part of the rule, not the wall object, maybe I can move the 'stop' text block.

Assuming I can move the 'stop' block, I can pick it up and place it elsewhere. So the action would be to move right (to get closer to the 'stop' block) and then move the 'stop' block left or somewhere else.

But the player's position isn't clear. The 'baba is you' rule is at 4 left 2 down. Maybe the player is one step to the right and up from there. So to reach the 'stop' at 2 left 3 up, the player would need to move left and up.

But this is getting too vague without the exact map layout. Let's try to outline possible moves based on the positions given.

The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up from what? From the 'baba' rule's position (4 left 2 down), so the 'stop' is 2 left from there plus 3 up? Maybe not. The positions are relative to the player's position, which is unknown.

Alternatively, the absolute positions might be as follows:

- The player (Baba) is at position (0,0).
- The 'baba is you' rule is at (-4, -2).
- The 'key' is at (2,3).
- The 'stop' rule is at (-2, -3).

To move the 'stop' block from (-2, -3) to another position, say (-3, -3), the player would need to move to that area.

But to get to (-2, -3), the player has to move left 2 and down 3, but there might be walls blocking the path. For example, walls at 1 step right (which would be at (1,0) if the player is at (0,0)), but the walls are to the right, so maybe the player is on the left side of the map, and the walls are to the right.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is near the bottom-left area, and the key is up and to the right, blocked by walls.

This is quite challenging without seeing the map. Let's try to think of the most straightforward solution.

The key is win, located at 2 right 3 up. There's a wall directly in the path (1 step right is a wall). To get past the wall, either remove its stop property or push it.

To push the wall, we need Baba to be a pusher. So create 'baba is push'.

To create 'baba is push', we need the 'push' text block. Since there's no 'push' rule, we have to use existing ones. Maybe 'baba is win' instead, which would make touching the key win the game.

To make 'baba is win', we need to move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'win' rule is at 6 right 4 up. That's far away. Alternatively, use the existing 'key is win' rule. If we can break that rule and create 'baba is win'.

Breaking 'key is win' would require moving either 'key', 'is', or 'win'. If we move 'win' to the 'baba' area.

For example, move the 'win' block left 6 steps and down 4 steps to reach the 'baba is you' rule area. But that's impossible in one move. The game likely allows moving one step at a time, so this approach isn't feasible.

Alternative idea: The key is already set as win, so if I can get to the key, I win. The problem is the path is blocked. If I can make the walls pass","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the win object, but since key is win, maybe I need to get the key? Or maybe change the rules to make Baba the win instead.

Looking at the map, there's a key located at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are all to the right at various positions. The first wall is 1 step right and 4 up, then another lower down. The key is behind a wall at 2 right and 3 up, but there's another wall at 1 right and 3 up. So the path to the key is blocked by walls that are stop, meaning I can't move through them unless I change their rules.

Since I'm Baba and baba is you, I can push objects if they aren't stop. But wall is stop, so I can't move the walls. However, maybe I can change the rules to make walls not stop. The rule that says wall is stop is located at 4 left and 3 up. To change that, I would need to move the 'wall' text block, the 'is' text block, and the 'stop' text block. But how?

Wait, the rules are formed by three text blocks: subject, is, property. So to change a rule, I need to rearrange these. The current wall is stop rule is made by the rule 'wall' at 4 left 3 up, 'is' at 3 left 3 up, and 'stop' at 2 left 3 up. If I can separate these, maybe I can make a new rule. But to do that, I have to move those text blocks. But are they movable? The tip says I can only move objects or text not defined as stop. Since wall is stop, but the text blocks themselves—are they considered stop? The 'stop' property is on the wall object, not the text. So the text blocks for 'wall', 'is', 'stop' should be movable unless another rule applies. But in this case, the only stop is on the wall objects, not the text. So I can move the text blocks.

So, the plan is: either break the wall is stop rule so walls aren't stop anymore, allowing me to push them, or create a new rule that lets me move through walls. Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba a different property, like win or stop, which might change the game.

Looking at the key, which is win. If I can get the key, maybe that's the win condition. But the key is behind walls. Alternatively, maybe I can change the key's rule. The key is defined as win by the text blocks at 4 right 4 up, 'is' at 5 right 4 up, and 'win' at 6 right 4 up. If I can take those text blocks and make Baba win instead, then I could turn into win and touch a wall to win. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba (you), if I can create a rule that says 'baba is win', then touching a wall would win. So the steps might be: move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks to form a new rule. Where are those text blocks? The 'baba' rule is at 4 left 2 down, 'is' at 3 left 2 down, and 'you' at 2 left 2 down. So currently, 'baba is you'. To change that to 'baba is win', I need to replace 'you' with 'win'. But where is the 'win' text block? There's one at 6 right 4 up. So I would need to move the 'you' text block (which is part of the 'baba is you' rule) and replace it with the 'win' text block.

So the steps could be: move the 'you' text block (which is 2 left 2 down) away, then move the 'win' text block from 6 right 4 up to the position where 'you' was. That would create 'baba is win', making Baba a win. Then, since walls are stop, but I'm now win, would that allow me to step on walls and win? Wait, the rules are that if you are win, touching a win object would win, but if you are win and step on a wall (which is stop), maybe that blocks you. Hmm, need to think.

Alternatively, if I make 'baba is stop', then I can't move, which is bad. So better to make 'baba is win'. Then, maybe stepping on a wall (which is stop) would still stop me unless there's a rule overriding. Wait, the priority might be that if you are win, even if you hit a stop, you win? Not sure. The exact behavior might depend on the game's mechanics. But if 'baba is win' and 'wall is stop', then when you touch a wall, since you are win, maybe you win. But I need to test that.

Alternatively, maybe get the key first. To get the key, which is at 2 right 3 up. The path is blocked by a wall at 1 right 3 up. If I can move that wall, but it's stop. So unless I change the wall's rule. If I can break the 'wall is stop' rule, then the wall becomes non-stop, so I can push it aside. To break that rule, I need to move the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' text blocks apart. Let's see where those are:

- 'wall' rule: 4 left 3 up
- 'is' rule: 3 left 3 up
- 'stop' rule: 2 left 3 up

To break this rule, I need to move at least one of these text blocks away. For example, move the 'stop' text block to another spot. Then the wall would no longer be stop. Once walls are not stop, I can move them. So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'stop' text block (2 left 3 up) to a different location. Where can I put it? Maybe near the key area. But need to see where there's space.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes, say, key is stop, but that might not help. Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba able to move through walls by making himself not stop. Wait, if I can make 'baba is not stop', but how? The game uses 'is' to define properties. So to negate, you might need to use 'is not', but I don't see that in the rules. Maybe not possible.

Alternatively, use the existing rule 'key is win' to get the key. If I can pick up the key, maybe that makes me win. But in Baba Is You, usually, you have to touch the win object. So getting the key might not be enough unless the rule is 'key is you', but it's 'key is win'. So touching the key would make me win, since key is win and I am you. Wait, yes! If I am you, and key is win, then touching the key would make me win. So maybe the solution is to reach the key.

But the key is behind walls. How to get past them. So if I can make the walls not stop, then I can move them or go around. So let's focus on breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.

To break that rule, I need to move the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' text blocks. Let's see where they are:

- 'wall' text block: 4 left 3 up
- 'is' text block: 3 left 3 up
- 'stop' text block: 2 left 3 up

These are all in a row, forming 'wall is stop'. To break this rule, I can move one of them. For example, move the 'stop' text block to somewhere else. Where can I put it? Maybe near the key area. Let's see, the key is at 2 right 3 up. The 'stop' block is at 2 left 3 up. Maybe move the 'stop' block to the right, next to the key. But how to move it? Since I'm Baba (you), I can push objects that are not stop. The 'stop' text block is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, but the text blocks themselves are not stopped unless another rule says so. Since 'wall is stop' is about the wall objects, not the text, the text blocks should be movable.

So, to move the 'stop' text block from 2 left 3 up to, say, 3 left 3 up (where the 'is' block is), but that would combine with 'is' and 'wall' again. Alternatively, move it further right. For example, move it to the same position as the key's 'win' text block at 6 right 4 up. But that's far. Alternatively, find a spot where it doesn't form a new rule.

Alternatively, move the 'wall' text block. If I move the 'wall' text block away, then the rule 'wall is stop' is broken. So moving 'wall' from 4 left 3 up to another location. Where? Maybe near the bottom where there are other rules. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left 2 down. If I move the 'wall' text block there, perhaps.

But how to move it step by step. Let's think of the movement. I am currently at the position of Baba, which is not specified in the observation, but the rules and objects are listed. Wait, the observation doesn't mention Baba's position. That's a problem. Without knowing where Baba is, it's hard to plan the path. Maybe I need to infer.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule baba' at 4 left 2 down. The 'is' and 'you' are nearby. So perhaps Baba is at that position or nearby. But the exact location isn't clear. This is a bit of a problem. Maybe I should assume that Baba is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 4 left 2 down. So to move towards the 'stop' text block at 2 left 3 up, I need to go right and up.

But to get there, I need to navigate around the walls. The path from 4 left 2 down to 2 left 3 up would require moving right twice and up once. However, along the way, are there any stop walls? Let's see. The walls are at 1 step right and various up positions. If I'm starting at 4 left 2 down, moving right would take me towards the walls. But maybe there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe the initial position is different. This is confusing without knowing Baba's location. Perhaps I should focus on the text blocks first. The key is at 2 right 3 up. To get there, I need to move through or around the walls. If I can make the walls not stop, that's better. So breaking the 'wall is stop' rule by moving the 'stop' text block.

The 'stop' text block is at 2 left 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since 'stop' is a property of the wall objects, not the text, the text block should be movable. So from wherever I am, I need to move towards the 'stop' block at 2 left 3 up, push it to a new location.

Assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule position (4 left 2 down), moving right three steps and up one step would get to 2 left 3 up (the 'stop' block). But along the way, there's a wall at 1 step right and various up positions. For example, wall at 1 right 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, etc. So moving from 4 left 2 down to 2 left 3 up would require moving right twice and up once. But the walls at 1 right 3 up are in the way. Unless I can move those walls by changing their rules.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: create a new rule that makes Baba a win. So take the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks. The 'baba' is at 4 left 2 down, 'is' at 3 left 2 down, and 'win' is at 6 right 4 up. To form 'baba is win', I need to move the 'win' text block to the position of the current 'you' (which is 2 left 2 down). So remove the 'you' and place 'win' there.

So steps would be:

1. Move the 'you' text block (2 left 2 down) out of the way. Where to? Maybe push it down or left.
2. Move the 'win' text block (6 right 4 up) to the position where 'you' was (2 left 2 down).
3. Now the rule is 'baba is win', so touching any win object (the key) would make me win.

But how to move these text blocks. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push movable objects. The text blocks are likely movable unless there's a 'stop' rule on them. Since 'wall is stop', but the text blocks aren't walls, they should be movable.

So to move the 'you' text block at 2 left 2 down, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Suppose I'm at 3 left 2 down (the 'is' block position). Then I could move right to 2 left 2 down (the 'you' block) and push it left or down. But I need to check the map for other objects in the way.

Alternatively, after moving the 'you' block, move the 'win' block from 6 right 4 up to 2 left 2 down. That would create 'baba is win'. Once that's done, touching the key (which is win) would make me win.

But how to perform these moves step by step. Let's outline the possible actions:

First, move the 'you' text block. To do that, I need to be next to it. If I'm at 3 left 2 down (the 'is' block), I can move right to 2 left 2 down (the 'you' block) and then move it left or down. For example, move right to get to the 'you' block, then left to push it to 1 left 2 down.

Then, move the 'win' text block from 6 right 4 up to 2 left 2 down. To do that, I need to navigate from 6 right 4 up to 2 left 2 down, which is a significant distance. But along the way, there are walls. For example, the wall at 1 right 4 up, and others down. However, if the 'wall is stop' rule is still in place, moving through those areas would be blocked unless the walls are moved.

This seems quite involved. Maybe the easier solution is to first break the 'wall is stop' rule by moving the 'stop' text block. Then, the walls become passable. Once walls are not stop, I can move them or go around them to reach the key.

So steps for breaking 'wall is stop':

1. Move the 'stop' text block from 2 left 3 up to a new location. Let's say move it down to where there are no walls. For example, move it to 2 left 3 down. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at 3 left 3 up (the 'is' block), I can move left to 2 left 3 up (the 'stop' block), then move down to 2 left 3 down.

But how to get to 2 left 3 up. From the 'baba' rule at 4 left 2 down, moving right three steps and up one step would get there. However, there's a wall at 1 right 3 up, which is in the way if I'm moving right. Wait, the path from 4 left 2 down to 2 left 3 up would be moving right twice (to 2 left) and up once (to 3 up). But between 4 left 2 down and 2 left 3 up, the horizontal distance is two steps to the right. Are there any walls in between? The walls are at 1 step right and various up positions, like 1 right 4 up, 3 up, etc. So moving right from 4 left 2 down to 2 left 2 down (which is the 'baba' rule's position), then right again to 1 left 2 down, then right to 0 left 2 down (which is 2 right). Wait, the coordinate system is a bit unclear. Maybe the steps are relative. For example, '1 step to the right' increases the x-coordinate by 1. Assuming that, then moving from 4 left 2 down (which would be x= -4, y= -2) to 2 left 3 up (x=-2, y=1). So moving right twice and up three steps. But along the way, there's a wall at 1 right 3 up (x=1, y=1). So if I'm moving right from x=-4 to x=-2, I pass x=-3, x=-2. The wall at x=1, y=1 is not in the path. So maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinate system is such that positive directions are right and up. So '1 step to the right' is +1 on the x-axis, '1 step up' is +1 on the y-axis. Then the 'wall' at 1 step right and 4 step up would be at (1,4). The 'key' is at (2,3). The 'stop' text block is at (-2,3). The 'baba' rule is at (-4, -2).

So to get from (-4, -2) to (-2,3), I need to move right two steps and up three steps. The path would be:

- From (-4, -2) → right to (-3, -2)
- Right to (-2, -2)
- Up to (-2, -1)
- Up to (-2, 0)
- Up to (-2, 1)

Let's take a look at the current observation. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get the key, which is currently acting as the win condition. But since I'm Baba, and baba is you, I need to reach the key to win. Let's see the objects on the map.

There are several walls arranged to the right of Baba. To the right and 4 steps up is a wall, and then the key, followed by ""is"" and ""win"" rules. To the left and down, there's another set of rules: rule wall, is, and stop. The key is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, the key's position is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up from Baba's current position?

Baba's position isn't explicitly mentioned, but looking at the objects, the rule `baba` is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So maybe Baba is at that spot. Let me reconstruct the map mentally.

Baba is at 4 left and 2 down. To the right of him, there are walls at various positions: 1 step right, 1 up, 1 down, etc. The key is at 2 right, 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls. The active rules say wall is stop, so touching a wall is bad. So how to get past the walls?

The key is win, so once I reach it, I win. But the problem is the walls blocking the way. The key is at 2 right and 3 up from Baba's position. Let's see the path. From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right 1 step would hit a wall at 1 step right. So can't go directly right. Maybe need to manipulate the rules.

Looking at the rules on the map, there are unused text blocks. For example, the rule `wall` is at 4 left and 3 up, followed by `is` and `stop`. Maybe I can rearrange these to change the properties of something. For instance, if I can make a wall not a stop, then I can pass through it. Or change what is you to become something else.

Since baba is you, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba something else. Like, if I can say ""baba is push"" or ""baba is win"", that might help. To do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule `baba`, `is`, and `you` are at 4 left, 2 down. If I can move those to form a new rule, maybe ""baba is win"", then I could be the win condition and reach the key without needing to pick it up.

But how to move the text blocks? The active rules say that objects not defined as stop can be moved. The rules themselves are text blocks. Are the text blocks movable? The tip says you can only move objects or text that are not stop. So if a text block is part of a rule, like ""key is win"", then the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", ""win"" are individual objects. Since wall is stop, but the rules (text blocks) might not be stop unless defined. The current rules are wall is stop, so the wall objects are stop, but the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"" might be movable unless specified otherwise.

So, the text blocks at 4 left and 3 up are rule `wall`, then `is`, then `stop`. If I can move those, maybe I can overwrite the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, if I move ""stop"" to after ""baba"" and ""is"", forming ""baba is stop"", that would make Baba a stop, which is bad. Alternatively, rearrange to make ""baba is win"", allowing me to be the win condition.

Let's look at the positions of the text blocks. The rule `baba` is at 4 left and 2 down, followed by `is` at 3 left, 2 down, and `you` at 2 left, 2 down. If I can move these three to form ""baba is win"", I need to get the `win` text block into position. The `win` rule is at 6 right and 4 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe use the existing `win` text block at 6 right, 4 up. But how to get there?

Alternatively, look at the key's position. The key is at 4 right, 4 up, with `key`, `is`, `win` text blocks. If I can move the `win` text block next to the key, making ""key is win"" again, but that's the original rule. Not helpful. Wait, the active rules already have ""key is win"", so that's set. Maybe instead, create a new rule that changes ""baba"" to something else.

Another approach: since the key is the win, but I can't reach it because of walls, maybe I can turn myself into the key. If I can create a rule ""baba is key"", then since key is win, I would be win. But how to do that? Need to move the `baba`, `is`, and `key` text blocks together.

The `key` text block is at 4 right, 4 up. The `baba` text block is at 4 left, 2 down. So moving from Baba's position, I need to navigate to the `baba` text block, then move it, along with `is` and `key`, to form ""baba is key"".

But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are all to the right. So how to get to the left side where the `baba` text block is? From Baba's current position (assuming he's at 4 left, 2 down), moving left is possible, but are there walls to the left? The closest wall is at 4 left and 3 up, which is part of the rule `wall is stop`. So moving left from Baba's position would take him to 5 left, 2 down. Is that blocked? The map doesn't show a wall there, so maybe possible.

So the plan could be:

1. Move left from Baba's position to reach the `baba` text block at 4 left, 2 down.
2. Pick up the `baba` text block and move it.
3. Similarly, move the `is` and `key` text blocks to form ""baba is key"".

But how to move the text blocks step by step. Each move can be one step in a direction, and you can only move objects that are not stop. The `baba` text block is part of a rule, but since the rule is ""baba is you"", and ""you"" is a property, maybe the text blocks are movable unless part of a STOP rule.

So, first, from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), move left to reach the `baba` text block. Wait, the `baba` text block is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if Baba is at that position, then moving left would take him further left. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the coordinates. Let me parse the positions correctly.

The rule `baba` is located at ""4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So if Baba's position is the reference point, then moving 4 left and 2 down from him would reach the `baba` text block. Wait, but that would mean the `baba` text block is at that position relative to Baba. So if Baba is at his starting point, say (0,0), then the `baba` text block is at (-4, -2). Similarly, other objects are positioned relative to Baba.

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming Baba is at the origin (0,0):

- wall is 1 step right and 4 up: at (1,4)
- rule `key` is 4 right, 4 up: (4,4)
- rule `is` is 5 right,4 up: (5,4)
- rule `win` is 6 right,4 up: (6,4)
- rule `wall` is 4 left, 3 up: (-4,3)
- rule `is` is 3 left,3 up: (-3,3)
- rule `stop` is 2 left,3 up: (-2,3)
- wall 1 right,3 up: (1,3)
- key 2 right,3 up: (2,3)
- walls descending to the right and 1 up, right, etc., down to (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1)
- rule `baba` is 4 left,2 down: (-4,-2)
- rule `is` is 3 left,2 down: (-3,-2)
- rule `you` is 2 left,2 down: (-2,-2)
- wall 1 right,2 down: (1,-2)

So the key is at (2,3). The problem is that from Baba at (0,0), moving right leads into walls at (1,4), (1,3), etc. So the path to the key is blocked. To reach the key, need to go around the walls, but they are all to the right. Maybe go above or below?

Looking at the map above Baba, at (0,1), there's a wall. At (0,2), a wall. Up to (0,4), a wall. So above is blocked. Below, at (0,-1), (0,-2) is a wall. The only open space seems to be to the left, where the `baba` text block is located.

So maybe the solution involves moving to the left side, manipulating the rules there. For example, the rule `wall is stop` is at (-4,3), (-3,3), (-2,3). If I can change that rule to something else, like `baba is not stop`, then I could move through walls.

But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks. Let's see: the `stop` rule is formed by ""wall is stop"". The text blocks for ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" are at (-4,3), (-3,3), (-2,3). If I can move these to form a different rule, like ""baba is not stop"", but ""not"" isn't a property here. Alternatively, ""baba is push"" or ""baba is win"".

Alternatively, use the existing `you` rule. The `you` text block is at (-2,-2). If I can form ""baba is you"" again, but that's already the case. Maybe create ""baba is win"" by moving `win` to the right of `baba` and `is`.

The `win` text block is at (6,4). That's far to the right. To get there from Baba's position, need to navigate past all the walls on the right. But that's not feasible. Alternatively, use the `win` text block that's part of the key's rule at (6,4), but that's already part of ""key is win"".

Another idea: since the key is win, and I'm Baba (you), maybe I can push the key towards me. But the key is at (2,3). To push it, I need to be adjacent and have the ""push"" property. But currently, I don't have push; wall is stop. Unless I can change my properties.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So I'm you, but I can't push. Maybe I can become push. To do that, create a rule ""baba is push"". To do that, I need to move the `baba`, `is`, and `push` text blocks. But where is `push`? It's not on the map. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, you. So no push. So that's not possible.

Alternative approach: Since the key is win, and I'm you, maybe I can move the key to me. But I can't move objects that are stop. The key is not stop; only walls are stop. So the key can be moved. How?

To move the key, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. But the key is at (2,3), and to get there, I need to go through the walls on the right. For example, from (0,0), move right to (1,0) which is a wall—can't. Move up to (0,1) which is a wall. Can't go up. Move down to (0,-1), which is a wall at (1,-1)? Wait, the walls to the right are from (1,4) down to (1,-2). So the only open spaces are to the left.

So perhaps the solution is to go to the left, manipulate the rules to remove the stop property from walls, then go around the walls on the right.

But how to get to the left side. From Baba at (0,0), moving left step by step:

1. Move left to (-1,0)
2. Left to (-2,0)
3. Left to (-3,0)
4. Left to (-4,0)
But checking the map, at (-4,0), is there a wall? The objects on the map don't show a wall at (-4,0), so maybe possible.

Alternatively, the rule `wall is stop` is at (-4,3), so below that. But moving left from (0,0) to (-4,0) should be possible if there are no walls there.

Once on the left side, at (-4,0), I can interact with the text blocks there. For example, the rule `wall is stop` is at (-4,3), so above. If I can move the `stop` text block from (-2,3) to another position to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how? Let's see the text blocks on the left:

- At (-4,3): rule `wall`
- (-3,3): rule `is`
- (-2,3): rule `stop`
- At (-4,-2): rule `baba`
- (-3,-2): rule `is`
- (-2,-2): rule `you`

If I can move these to form a new rule. For example, moving `baba`, `is`, and `stop` to make ""baba is stop"", which would make me a stop, bad. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move `baba`, `is`, `win` from the key's rule (at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)) to form ""baba is win"". But that's far away. How to get there?

From the left side at (-4,0), moving right to (4,0) would take a long time, passing through many walls on the right. Not feasible.

Alternative idea: Use the existing `win` text block at (6,4). If I can create a rule ""baba is win"" by moving the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks together. But again, the distance is too big.

Wait, there's another `win` rule at (6,4), part of ""key is win"". So the `win` text block is there. Maybe I can detatch it and attach it to `baba`.

But to do that, I need to move the `win` text block from (6,4) to, say, (-4,-2) where the `baba` rule is. That would require moving right 10 steps and up 6 steps, which is impossible in one move. Each action is a single step.

So this approach isn't feasible.

Another thought: The key is at (2,3), and it's a win. If I can make the key not a win, then maybe the actual win condition is somewhere else. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so unless I change that, the key remains the win.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""baba is win"", making me the win. To do that, I need to form the rule ""baba is win"" using the text blocks available.

The `baba` text block is at (-4,-2), `is` at (-3,-2), and `you` at (-2,-2). If I can move the `you` to the right and replace it with `win`, but where is `win`? The `win` text blocks are at (6,4) and (6,4) as part of the key's rule. So distant.

Alternatively, use the `win` text block from the key's rule. To get there, I need to navigate from Baba's position (0,0) to (6,4), but that's blocked by walls on the right. The path is blocked by walls at (1,4), (1,3), etc. So can't go that way.

Alternative plan: Since the key is win, and I can't reach it, maybe I can make a copy of the win rule somewhere else. For example, take the `win` text block and place it next to Baba. But again, the distance is too great.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach. The rule `key is win` means that the key makes something win. If I can make Baba the key, then since key is win, I would be win. To make Baba the key, create the rule ""baba is key"". To do that, need to move the `baba`, `is`, and `key` text blocks together.

The `key` text block is at (4,4). The `baba` text block is at (-4,-2). The `is` text block is at (-3,-2) and (5,4). So moving from (-4,-2) to (4,4) requires moving right 8 steps and up 6 steps, which is impossible in a single move. But maybe step by step.

But this seems complicated and time-consuming, and each move has to be a single step. Plus, the walls on the right make movement difficult.

Alternative idea: Use the existing `you` rule. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push the key towards me. But to push, I need the ""push"" property, which I don't have. Unless I can change my properties.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. There's no rule about pushing. So unless I create a rule that says ""baba is push"", I can't push objects.

But to create ""baba is push"", I need the `baba`, `is`, and `push` text blocks. However, there's no `push` text","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So normally, I would move towards the key because key is win, but maybe there's a catch here.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 1 step to the right at various positions up to 4 steps up. Also, there's a wall to the left at 4 steps left and 3 steps up, which might be part of another rule. The rule blocks are arranged in a certain way: key, is, win at the top right, and another set of wall, is, stop to the left of that. Then further down, there's a rule saying baba is you, which means I can move as Baba.

Wait, so the key is the win object, but it's behind walls that are stop. But since I'm Baba and the rule says baba is you, I can move. But the problem is the walls are stop, so normally I can't pass through them. Unless I can change the rules to make the walls not stop. Or maybe make myself able to pass through them.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a rule ""wall is stop"" at 4 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule block or break it apart, maybe I can change what wall does. But to move a rule block, I need to be able to push it. Since I'm you (because baba is you), I can push objects unless they're stop. But the wall itself is stop, so can I push the rule blocks that are on the wall?

Wait, the rule blocks are separate objects. The rule ""wall is stop"" is a text block, not part of the wall. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule to somewhere else. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule off the ""wall is"" rule, then the wall might no longer be stop. Let's see the positions:

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made by the rule ""wall"" at 4 left, 3 up, then ""is"" at 3 left, 3 up, then ""stop"" at 2 left, 3 up. So those three blocks are forming the rule. If I can separate them, then the rule wall is stop would be broken. To do that, I need to move one of the blocks. But can I move the ""stop"" block? Well, the walls to the right are stop, but the rule blocks might not be considered stop unless the rule is active. Since the rule wall is stop is active, but the rule blocks themselves are not part of a wall. Wait, the rule blocks are separate text objects. So maybe they can be moved unless they are part of a STOP object.

But in the current rules, wall is stop, but the rule blocks themselves are not walls. So maybe I can move them. Let's check the positions:

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. But right now, where am I located? The observation doesn't explicitly say where the player (Baba) is. Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"", ""rule `you` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". But where is Baba the player? The active rule is baba is you, so the player is represented by Baba. But the position of Baba isn't directly listed. Wait, maybe the rule ""baba is you"" is a text block, but the actual Baba object is separate. Hmm, this might be a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming that the player (Baba) is somewhere on the grid. The walls are to the right, forming a barrier. The key is to the right and up, but blocked by walls. The rule blocks that define wall is stop are to the left. If I can get to those rule blocks and rearrange them, maybe I can change the rules.

Alternatively, since key is win, maybe I don't need to move the key physically but change the rule so that something else is win. For example, making Baba win by changing ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule block. The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 steps up, along with ""key"" and ""is"". So if I can move the ""win"" block to be under ""baba is"", then the rule would be ""baba is win"", making me win. But how to get to that area?

The problem is the path to the top right is blocked by walls. The only way to reach the rule blocks at the top right is to go through the walls, but they are stop. Unless I can make the walls not stop. So perhaps the solution is to disrupt the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" part of that rule, then walls might no longer be stop, allowing me to push through them or move around.

To move the ""stop"" rule, which is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, I need to be adjacent to it. Let's assume my position is somewhere. Maybe I'm at the lower part where the ""baba is you"" rule is. The rule ""baba"" is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, ""is"" at 3 left and 2 down, ""you"" at 2 left and 2 down. So the player (Baba) is probably at the position of the ""baba"" text block? Or is the player a separate object? This is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the player is at the location where the ""baba"" rule starts, which is 4 left and 2 down. Let's say I'm there.

From my position at 4 left and 2 down, I need to move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 left and 3 up. The direction would be up and to the left. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step down, which is stop. But if I can move left from my position, maybe I can reach the ""stop"" rule. Wait, moving left from 4 left would take me to 3 left, but there's a wall at 4 left and 3 up (part of the ""wall is stop"" rule). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on possible actions.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can pick up the key by moving adjacent to it. The key is at 2 right and 3 up. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, a wall at 1 right and 3 up. So to get to the key, I need to go around the walls. But the walls are stop, so I can't pass through them. Unless I can push them. To push a wall, I need to be behind it and move in the same direction. But since walls are stop, I can't move into them. So pushing might not be possible unless the wall is not considered stop. Wait, if the rule wall is stop is removed, then walls might not be stop anymore. So perhaps the solution is to remove the ""stop"" part of the wall rule.

So, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 4 left, 3 up; ""is"" at 3 left, 3 up; ""stop"" at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, the rule would be broken. To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position, assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location (4 left, 2 down), I need to move up and left. From 4 left, 2 down, moving up one step would be 4 left, 1 down. Then left to 3 left, 1 down. But there's a wall at 1 right and 1 down, which is stop. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let's parse the objects again.

The objects are listed as:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- key 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- etc.

So the top right has a wall, key, and then the rules key is win. The left side has another set of rules forming wall is stop. The player (Baba) is associated with the rule ""baba is you"" located at 4 left, 2 down; 3 left, 2 down; 2 left, 2 down.

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. From there, I need to reach the ""stop"" rule at 2 left, 3 up. The path would involve moving left and up, but there might be obstacles. Let's see:

From 4 left, 2 down:

- Move up to 4 left, 1 down.
- Move up again to 4 left, 0 down (assuming up increases the step count? Wait, the directions are a bit unclear. The problem says ""1 step to the right and 4 step up"" — maybe the coordinate system is such that up and right are positive directions. So, each step up increases the Y coordinate, and right increases the X coordinate. So the player's position is at (X, Y), and moving up adds to Y, right adds to X.

But without knowing the exact starting position of Baba, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the location of the ""baba"" text block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So in coordinates, that would be (-4, -2) if left is negative X and down is negative Y. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, which is (-2, 3). To get there from (-4, -2), the movement would be right (increase X) and up (increase Y). So move right twice and up five times? But that's a lot of steps, and there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think about the rule blocks. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, then the wall rule would be broken. So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule block to a different position, thus removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then the walls would no longer be stop, and I could push them or move through them.

To move the ""stop"" block at (-2, 3), I need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position at (-4, -2), moving right once to (-3, -2), then right again to (-2, -2), then up to (-2, -1), (-2, 0), (-2, 1), (-2, 2), (-2, 3). But along the way, are there any stop walls? The wall at 1 step right (which would be X=1, Y=0) is stop. But if I'm moving left from Baba's position, maybe there are no walls in the path. Wait, the walls mentioned are all to the right side. For example, wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up is at (1,4). So the left side has the rule blocks but no walls except the ones created by the rules.

So moving from (-4, -2) to (-2, 3) seems possible if there are no walls in between. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different position. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Another angle: since key is win, maybe I can pick up the key by moving next to it. The key is at (2,3) if right is positive X and up is positive Y. But there's a wall at (1,3), which is stop. So I can't get past that wall unless I can make it not stop. So again, the solution is to remove the ""stop"" rule.

To do that, move the ""stop"" text block. Let's see where it's located. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, which is (-2,3). To move that block, I need to be adjacent to it. If I can get to (-2,3) and then move it, say, to the left or right.

Assuming I can move the ""stop"" block left to (-3,3), that would break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Once that's done, I could potentially push the walls or move through them.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""stop"" rule block at (-2,3).
2. Move the ""stop"" block to a new position, say, left to (-3,3).
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
4. Navigate past the walls to the key and pick it up, since key is win.

But how to execute this movement? Let's break it down.

First, determine the path from Baba's position to (-2,3). If Baba is at (-4, -2), moving right twice and up five times would get there. But maybe there are obstacles. Alternatively, maybe Baba is at a different location. Without knowing the exact starting position, it's hard to say, but let's proceed with the assumption.

From (-4, -2):

- Move right to (-3, -2)
- Move right to (-2, -2)
- Move up to (-2, -1)
- Move up to (-2, 0)
- Move up to (-2, 1)
- Move up to (-2, 2)
- Move up to (-2, 3) — this is the ""stop"" block.

Once there, move the ""stop"" block. To move a block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, pushing it if necessary. Since ""stop"" is a text block, and there's no other object in the adjacent cells, I can move it. For example, moving left from (-2,3) to (-3,3).

So the action would be: left (to get to (-3,3)), then push the ""stop"" block left. Wait, but the action is a single step. Each action is one step in a direction. To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be next to it and move in the direction I want to push it. So if I'm at (-2,3) and want to move the ""stop"" block to (-3,3), I need to move left (direction), which would push the ""stop"" block left.

So the action would be left, pushing the ""stop"" block to (-3,3). This would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

After that, the walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them. Then navigate to the key at (2,3), passing through the walls since they're no longer stop. Once I reach the key, since key is win, I can touch it to win.

Alternatively, if I change the rule to make Baba win, that could be another approach. For example, moving the ""win"" block to associate with Baba. The ""win"" block is at (6,4). To reach there, I'd have to go through the walls again, but if walls are no longer stop, that's possible.

So step-by-step:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at (-2,3) by moving right and up.
2. Push the ""stop"" block left to (-3,3), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, walls are passable.
4. Move towards the key at (2,3), going around the walls (which are now stop but we can push through? Wait, no, if walls are no longer stop, then they are normal objects. So I can move past them.

Wait, if the rule ""wall is stop"" is removed, then walls are just regular objects with the ""wall"" property but not ""stop"". So they can be moved unless there's another rule making them stop. Since the only stop rule is removed, I can now push the walls.

But to get to the key, which is at (2,3), there's a wall at (1,3). Since walls are no longer stop, I can push them. So perhaps I can push the wall at (1,3) out of the way.

So after removing the ""stop"" rule:

- Move to (1,3) (the wall), push it left to (0,3), creating a path to the key at (2,3).

Then, move right past the pushed wall to the key and pick it up.

Alternatively, since key is win, touching it would win the level regardless of the path.

Putting it all together, the actions would be:

- Navigate to (-2,3) (stop block)
- Push stop left to (-3,3)
- Navigate to (1,3) wall and push it left
- Move to (2,3) key and take it

But each action is a single step. So the initial action would be to move towards the stop block.

Assuming the player is at (-4, -2), the first move would be right to (-3, -2), then right to (-2, -2), up to (-2, -1), up to (-2, 0), up to (-2, 1), up to (-2, 2), up to (-2, 3). At that point, the action would be to move left, pushing the stop block to (-3,3).

So the first valid action is left, which would push the stop block.

Let's see. I need to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal here is usually to reach the key since key is win, but I have to remember that the rules can be changed.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are defined as stop, so I can't move through them. However, since I'm Baba and baba is you, I can push objects if they're not stop. Wait, but the walls are stop, so I can't push them. Hmm, that complicates things.

Let me check the layout again. The key is at (2 right, 3 up). There's a wall directly to the left of it at 1 step right and 3 up. So I need to get past that wall. But since the wall is stop, I can't move into it. Maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the wall not stop? The existing rules for wall are at 3 steps left and 3 up: ""rule wall is stop"". If I can move that rule, maybe I can change wall's property.

To move a rule, I need to be next to the text blocks that form the rule. The rule ""wall is stop"" is made of three objects: rule 'wall', 'is', 'stop'. They are placed at 3 left, 3 up; 2 left, 3 up; 1 left, 3 up. So to move this rule, I need to be adjacent to one of these text blocks. But where am I currently located? The player (Baba) is probably at the position defined by the default start, which might be at 0,0 or another spot. Wait, the observation doesn't mention Baba's position directly. Maybe I need to deduce it based on the objects.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 2 steps down, along with 'is' and 'you'. So the rule ""baba is you"" is formed by those three blocks. That means the player (Baba) is likely at the position that corresponds to the 'baba' text block. But how does that translate to movement? Maybe the player is at the location of the 'baba' rule. Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is usually the object that is ""YOU"". Since ""baba is you"" is a rule, the player is Baba. So Baba's position is where the 'baba' text block is located? Or is it a separate object?

This is a bit confusing. Let me think. In Baba Is You, the player is the object that is marked as ""YOU"". So if the rule is ""baba is you"", then the Baba tile is the player. So where is the Baba tile on the map? The observation lists objects like walls, key, and rules, but not the actual Baba character. Wait, maybe the Baba is represented by the 'baba' text block's position? Or is there a separate Baba object?

Hmm, this is a problem. The observation doesn't mention Baba's position explicitly. The rules are there, but without knowing where the player is, it's hard to plan. Maybe I need to assume that the player is at a specific location, like the starting point. Alternatively, perhaps the 'baba' rule's position indicates where the player is. Let me check the objects again.

The rule `baba` is at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, in the previous observation, after moving left, the rule `baba` moved to 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So when I moved left, the entire 'baba is you' rule moved left by one step. That suggests that the player (Baba) is linked to that rule. So moving the rule moves Baba. Therefore, to reach the key, I need to move the 'baba is you' rule to a position where I can pathfind to the key.

The key is at 2 right, 3 up. There are walls blocking the path. The wall at 1 right, 3 up is a problem. To remove that wall's 'stop' property, I need to either delete the 'wall is stop' rule or change it. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 3 left, 3 up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to one of its components: 'rule wall', 'is', or 'stop'.

Looking at the current positions after moving left, the 'baba is you' rule is now at 3 left, 2 down. So if I move up from there, perhaps I can reach the 'wall is stop' rule. Let's see. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 3 left, 3 up. The player's current position (based on the 'baba' rule) is 3 left, 2 down. To get to 3 left, 3 up, I need to move up once. But can I do that?

Wait, when you move the 'baba is you' rule, you effectively move Baba along with it. So if I move the rule up, Baba moves up. But I need to check if the movement is possible. The path from the current position (3 left, 2 down) to 3 left, 3 up: there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, but that's in a different direction. Wait, maybe the movement is blocked by other walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'wall is stop' rule out of the way. If I can move the 'wall is stop' rule to a different position, then the walls might no longer be 'stop', allowing me to pass through. To move that rule, I need to push the 'stop' text block. Since the rule is ""wall is stop"", the components are 'rule wall', 'is', 'stop' in a horizontal line. So to move the entire rule, I need to be adjacent to one of these blocks and move in the desired direction.

The 'stop' block of the 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 left, 3 up. If I can get to that position and move it, perhaps I can reposition the entire rule. But how do I get there? The player's current position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 3 left, 2 down. To reach 1 left, 3 up, I need to move right and up. But there might be walls in the way. Let's see.

From 3 left, 2 down, moving right would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Then up to 2 left, 1 down. Then up again to 2 left, 0 down. Then right to 1 left, 0 down. Then up to 1 left, 1 up. Then up to 1 left, 2 up. Then up to 1 left, 3 up. But along this path, are there any stop walls? Let's check the objects:

- At 1 step right and 1 step down from the start, there's a wall.
- At 1 step right, there are walls at various positions up to 4 step up.
- But moving from 3 left, 2 down towards 1 left, 3 up, the path might be blocked by walls. For example, at 2 left, 2 down, is there a wall? The objects listed include walls at 1 step right and 2 steps down, but that's on the right side. On the left side, there's a wall at 4 step left and 3 step up, but that's further to the left. So maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe moving the 'wall is stop' rule to the left. If I can move the entire rule to the left, then the wall's 'stop' property would be elsewhere, possibly not blocking the key's path. To do that, I need to push the 'stop' block of the 'wall is stop' rule to the left. The 'stop' block is at 1 left, 3 up. Moving it left would place it at 2 left, 3 up. Then the rule would be ""wall is stop"" but located at 2 left, 3 up instead of 1 left, 3 up. That way, the original wall at 1 right, 3 up (which is a separate wall object) might no longer be affected by the 'stop' rule.

But how do I move the 'stop' block? Since the player is at 3 left, 2 down, I need to navigate there. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move from current position (3 left, 2 down) to the 'stop' block at 1 left, 3 up.
   - Path: right to 2 left, 2 down; up to 2 left, 3 down; right to 1 left, 3 down; up to 1 left, 3 up.
   - Check for walls along the way. Are there any walls at these positions?
   - At 1 left, 3 up, there's the 'stop' block. So moving up from 1 left, 3 down to 1 left, 3 up would place me next to the 'stop' block.

2. Once adjacent to the 'stop' block, move it left. Since the 'stop' block is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, moving it would move the entire rule left by one step.

3. After moving the rule, the 'wall is stop' rule is now at 2 left, 3 up. The original wall at 1 right, 3 up (which is a separate wall object) is no longer under the 'stop' rule, so it's just a wall but not stop. Then I can move past it to reach the key.

But I need to make sure that during this process, I'm not moving into a STOP object. Since the player is Baba and 'baba is you', and if I move the rule, I'm moving Baba with it. So as long as the path to the 'stop' block isn't blocked by other STOP objects, it should be possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the key is WIN, and if I can grab the key, does that mean I win? Wait, no. In Baba Is You, the WIN object is what you need to touch. The key being WIN means that touching the key makes you WIN, but I think the actual win condition is usually a separate object. Wait, maybe the key itself is the WIN object, so touching it would make me WIN. So the goal is to reach the key.

But the key is at 2 right, 3 up, behind a wall that's STOP. So to get there, I need to make the wall not STOP. The way to do that is to rearrange the 'wall is stop' rule.

Another approach: create a new rule that makes the wall a different property, like 'wall is you', which would let me push it. But to create that, I need to have the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'you' in a row. However, the 'you' text block is already part of the 'baba is you' rule. So maybe I can detach the 'you' block and form a new rule.

Wait, the 'baba is you' rule is at 3 left, 2 down. The components are 'rule baba', 'is', 'you'. If I can move the 'you' block away and attach it to 'wall', I could create 'wall is you'. But that requires moving the 'you' block, which is part of the existing rule. To move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which would move the entire rule if it's part of one.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Move the 'baba is you' rule to a different position to free up the 'you' block.
2. Then, use the 'you' block to create a new rule like 'wall is you'.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, focus on moving the existing 'wall is stop' rule out of the way.

Let me try to outline the movement step by step:

Current player position (based on 'baba' rule) is at 3 left, 2 down.

First, move up from 3 left, 2 down to 3 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, but that's on the right side. On the left side, moving up from 3 left, 2 down to 3 left, 1 down: I don't see any walls mentioned in that area. So that should be possible.

Next, move up to 3 left, 0 down. Again, check for walls. No walls mentioned here, so possible.

Then move right to 2 left, 0 down. Still no walls mentioned.

Move up to 2 left, 1 up. Check objects: there's a wall at 1 right, 1 step up. But that's on the right side. On the left side, moving up from 2 left, 0 down to 2 left, 1 up: no walls mentioned.

Move right to 1 left, 1 up.

Move up to 1 left, 2 up.

Move up to 1 left, 3 up. Here, there's the 'stop' block of the 'wall is stop' rule. So now I'm adjacent to the 'stop' block.

Now, move the 'stop' block left. Since it's part of the 'wall is stop' rule, moving it left would move the entire rule to 2 left, 3 up. This would remove the 'stop' property from the wall at 1 right, 3 up (assuming the wall's position is 1 right, 3 up). Wait, the walls are at various positions on the right side. The wall at 1 right, 3 up is the one blocking the key. If the 'wall is stop' rule is now at 2 left, 3 up, then the wall at 1 right, 3 up is no longer under the 'stop' rule, so it's just a regular wall but not stop. Therefore, I can move past it.

After moving the 'wall is stop' rule, I can go around the wall to the key. The key is at 2 right, 3 up. From the 'stop' block's new position (2 left, 3 up), I need to navigate to the key.

But wait, the player is now at 1 left, 3 up after moving the 'stop' block. To reach the key at 2 right, 3 up, I need to move right twice. However, there's a wall at 1 right, 3 up (the same one we were trying to bypass). But if the 'wall is stop' rule has been moved, that wall is no longer stop, so I can move right past it.

So the path would be: from 1 left, 3 up, move right to 2 left, 3 up (which is the new position of the 'wall is stop' rule), then right again to 3 left, 3 up. But wait, the key is at 2 right, 3 up. Assuming the coordinate system is relative, maybe the player needs to move right from their current position.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to move the 'wall is stop' rule out of the way and then proceed to the key.

Alternatively, after moving the 'wall is stop' rule, the wall at 1 right, 3 up is no longer stop, so I can move around it. From the player's new position (after moving the 'stop' block), which is 1 left, 3 up, moving right twice would take me to 3 left, 3 up, which is the new position of the 'wall is stop' rule. Then moving right again to 4 left, 3 up, but I don't know if there's a wall there. Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different direction.

Wait, the key is at 2 right, 3 up. So from the player's position at 1 left, 3 up, moving right three steps would reach 4 left, 3 up, which might be the key's position. But I'm not sure about the coordinate system. This is tricky without a visual map.

Another angle: since the key is WIN, maybe touching it makes me WIN, regardless of the walls. But I still need to reach it. If the walls are not STOP, I can push them or move around them.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the wall a PUSH or something. But to do that, I need the 'push' text block, which I don't see in the current rules.

Wait, the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you. So no 'push' block. So probably can't make walls pushable.

Back to the original plan: move the 'wall is stop' rule to the left, making the wall at 1 right, 3 up not stop. Then move right past it to get to the key.

To do that, I need to execute the actions to move the 'stop' block left. The steps would be:

1. Move from 3 left, 2 down (Baba's position) to 1 left, 3 up (adjacent to 'stop' block).
   - Actions: right, up, right, up, right, up.

But need to confirm the path is clear. Assuming there are no walls blocking this path, which based on the current objects, there don't seem to be any walls in between.

Once at 1 left, 3 up, the next action is to move the 'stop' block left. In Baba Is You, to move a text block, you push it in the desired direction. So if I am adjacent to the 'stop' block and move left, the 'stop' block (and hence the entire 'wall is stop' rule) moves left by one step.

So the action would be 'left', pushing the 'stop' block left.

After that, the 'wall is stop' rule is now at 2 left, 3 up, and the wall at 1 right, 3 up is no longer stop. Therefore, I can move right past it to reach the key.

So the chosen action is to move left, which would push the 'stop' block and reposition the rule.

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, but right now, the active rule says ""key is win"". So instead of going for the WIN object, I need to get the key. The rule also says ""wall is stop"", which means walls block my path. And ""baba is you"", so I can move the Baba character around by pulling or pushing objects, as long as they aren't stopped by ""stop"" properties.

Looking at the map, I see the key is located at 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up from where I currently am. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, let me double-check the current observation. 

Current active rules are the same: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The objects on the map now show the key at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. There are several walls arranged to the right and at different up/down positions. The rule blocks for ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" are also present, which I might need to move to change other rules.

From the current position, I need to navigate to the key. The path to the key is blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, then another wall 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else so that I can push or move the walls away. But how?

In Baba Is You, to change a rule, you can move the text blocks that form the rule. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop"", you can move the ""stop"" text block to another object to change its property. Alternatively, you can create a new rule by combining subject and property blocks.

Looking at the objects, there are rule blocks for ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", and ""wall"". The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" and ""you"" are there. So maybe I can move the ""you"" from the ""baba is you"" rule to another subject, making myself (Baba) have a different property. For example, if I make ""baba is win"", then reaching the key would make me win. But how to do that?

Alternatively, since the key is the win now, I need to get to it. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me see the layout again. The key is at 4 steps right and 3 up. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 up, then another wall at 2 steps right and 3 up. So to get to the key, I need to move past these walls. But since walls are stop, I can't push them unless I change their rule. 

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is in place. If I can change ""stop"" to something else, maybe the walls become pushable. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to another object, like making ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". But how to do that?

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So if I can move that ""stop"" block elsewhere. Let's see: the ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. To change that, I need to move the ""stop"" block. So maybe I can take the ""stop"" block and attach it to another subject. For example, making ""key is stop"" would block the key, but that's bad. Alternatively, making ""baba is stop"" would stop me, which is also bad.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For instance, if I can make ""baba is not stop"", but how? The current rules don't have that. Alternatively, maybe I can push the walls by making them movable. If I change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then I could push the walls out of the way. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule and attach it to another property. Let's see: the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the ""wall"" rule block, an ""is"" block, and a ""stop"" block. If I take the ""stop"" block and place it under a different subject, like ""key is stop"", but that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I can make ""wall is push"", then I can push them. But how?

Wait, the ""is"" blocks are also on the map. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are present. So maybe I can take an ""is"" block and combine it with other rules. For example, if I have a ""wall"" rule block and a ""push"" rule block, and an ""is"" block, I can create ""wall is push"". But where is the ""push"" block? I don't see a ""push"" rule in the active rules. The current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the available property blocks are key, win, wall, is, stop, you.

So the available text blocks to move are the rule blocks for key, is, win, wall, stop, and you. The ""you"" block is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can move the ""you"" block to the key, making ""key is you"", then touching the key would make me the you, but that might not help. Or if I make ""baba is win"", then I would win just by being Baba, but where is the win block?

Alternatively, since the key is the win, maybe I can pick up the key by moving to it, but the path is blocked by walls. So I need to remove the walls or make them non-stop. To remove the walls, I can change their rule from ""wall is stop"" to something else. For that, I need to move the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 step up. The components are the ""wall"" rule block at 4 step left and 3 up, an ""is"" block at 3 step left and 3 up, and a ""stop"" block at 2 step left and 3 up. So to change this, I need to take the ""stop"" block and attach it to another subject. For example, attaching it to the ""key"" rule block, making ""key is stop"", which would block the key, but that's bad. Alternatively, attaching it to ""baba"", making ""baba is stop"", which would stop me. Not good.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes walls pushable. To do that, I need a ""push"" property. But there's no ""push"" rule in the active rules. So I can't create that directly. Unless there's a way to manipulate existing rules. Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the available properties are key, win, wall, is, stop, you.

Perhaps I can make a rule that says ""wall is key"". That way, walls would act like keys. But how does that help? If I can push walls by making them keys, but I don't think that's how the game works. Alternatively, making ""wall is you"" would let me move them, but since I'm already you, maybe I can push them. Let's think.

If I make ""wall is you"", then walls would be considered as ""you"", meaning I can push them. To do that, I need to take the ""you"" block from the ""baba is you"" rule and attach it to the ""wall"" rule. So the steps would be: move the ""you"" block from the ""baba"" rule to the ""wall"" rule, creating ""wall is you"". Then, walls would be pushable, and I could push them out of the way to reach the key.

Let me check the positions of these rule blocks. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, with the ""baba"" block, an ""is"" block, and a ""you"" block. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 step up, with ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" blocks. So to create ""wall is you"", I need to take the ""you"" block from the ""baba"" rule and place it next to the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks.

But wait, can I move the ""you"" block while the game is running? The rules are on the map, and I can move them as long as they are not defined as stop or similar. Since ""baba is you"", I am you, so I can move any text blocks, right? Because in Baba Is You, if you are the ""you"" subject, you can move text blocks. So yes, I can pick up the ""you"" block and place it elsewhere.

So the plan is: move the ""you"" block from the ""baba is you"" rule to the ""wall is stop"" rule, changing it to ""wall is you"". Then, walls become pushable, and I can push them out of the way to reach the key.

Let me visualize the positions. The ""you"" block is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 step up. So I need to navigate to where the ""you"" block is, pick it up, and then carry it to the ""wall is stop"" rule's location to replace the ""stop"" block with ""you"".

But how do I move the ""you"" block? To do that, I have to move Baba (since I'm you) to the position of the ""you"" block, then pick it up by moving onto it, and then carry it to the desired location.

Looking at the map, the ""you"" block is part of the ""baba is you"" rule at 4 step left and 2 steps down. The current position of Baba (since ""baba is you"") is not explicitly stated, but I assume I'm at the position of the Baba object. Wait, the objects on the map list ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So the Baba rule block is there, but where is the actual Baba character? Typically, in Baba Is You, the player character is the Baba object that is defined as ""you"". So the Baba character is likely at the position of the ""baba"" rule block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down.

So to get to the ""you"" block, I need to move Baba from 4 left, 2 down to the position of the ""you"" block, which is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So the ""you"" block is located there. So the path from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) to the ""you"" block (2 left, 2 down) is two steps to the right. But is there any obstacles? Between them, are there walls or other blocks?

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, then another wall at 1 step right and 1 step down, etc. But from Baba's position at 4 left, 2 down, moving right two steps would take me to 2 left, 2 down, which is where the ""you"" block is. The path is clear except for possibly other blocks. Wait, the rule blocks are separate from the character's position. The character is a separate object, probably at a different location. Wait, maybe the Baba character is at a different position. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the Baba character is where the ""baba"" rule block is located. So if the ""baba"" rule block is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, then the Baba character is there. So to get to the ""you"" block at 2 step left and 2 steps down, I need to move right two steps. But between 4 left and 2 left, there's nothing blocking, right? Because the walls are further to the right (1 step right and up/down positions). So moving right two steps from 4 left would be to 2 left, same y (2 down), which is where the ""you"" block is. So that's possible.

Once I reach the ""you"" block, I can pick it up and carry it to the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 3 step up. So from the ""you"" block's position (2 left, 2 down), I need to move to 4 left, 3 up. That's a distance of 2 steps left and 1 step up. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: moving left from 2 left to 4 left would pass through 3 left, then 4 left. Are there walls there? Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 4 step left and 3 step up (part of the ""wall is stop"" rule), but that's the destination. Also, there's a wall at 4 step left and 2 step up, and others. So moving left two steps from 2 left to 4 left would pass through 3 left, which has a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" — no, that's at 2 step left and 3 step up. Wait, the objects listed include:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up

So at 3 left, 3 up, there's an ""is"" rule block. So moving from 2 left, 2 down to 4 left, 3 up would require moving left two steps and up one step. But between 2 left and 4 left, there's 3 left. At 3 left, 3 up, there's an ""is"" block. So can I go through there? Since ""is"" is a text block, and I'm Baba (you), I can move through it unless it's part of a ""stop"" rule. But ""is"" itself isn't stopped unless specified. So moving through the ""is"" block at 3 left, 3 up should be possible.

So the plan is:

1. Move Baba from 4 left, 2 down to 2 left, 2 down (the ""you"" block's position) by moving right twice.
2. Pick up the ""you"" block by moving onto it.
3. Carry the ""you"" block to the ""wall is stop"" rule's position (4 left, 3 up).
4. Place the ""you"" block next to the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks, replacing the ""stop"" block, creating ""wall is you"".
5. Now, walls are pushable. Go push the walls blocking the path to the key.
6. Navigate to the key at 4 steps right and 3 step up, collect it, and since key is win, the level is solved.

But let's check the steps again. First, moving right twice from 4 left to 2 left. Is that possible? Are there any walls in between? The walls are at 1 step right (and various ups/downs), but from 4 left, moving right two steps would be to 3 left, then 2 left. No walls mentioned in that path. So that's clear.

Once at 2 left, 2 down, which has the ""you"" block, I need to move onto it to pick it up. Then, carry it to the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. So from 2 left, 2 down, I need to move left two steps and up one step. Let's see:

- From 2 left, 2 down: move left to 3 left, 2 down.
- Then left again to 4 left, 2 down.
- Then up one step to 4 left, 3 down. Wait, no. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 step up. So from 4 left, 2 down, moving up one step would be to 4 left, 1 down. Wait, the coordinate system is a bit confusing. The directions are relative. Assuming that ""up"" increases the y-coordinate and ""down"" decreases it, but the exact mapping depends on the game's grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are absolute. For example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is 4 steps left and 3 steps up from some origin. But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to say. This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to focus on the relative positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to the right and up from the current position. Given that in the initial observations, the key was moving further right and up each time the action was ""left"", maybe the key is being pushed away by some mechanism. Wait, in the previous observations, after each ""left"" action, the key's position changed. For example, initially, the key was 2 steps right and 3 up, then after moving left, it became 4 steps right and 4 up, then 5 steps, etc. So maybe the key is being pushed to the right and up by some other mechanism, possibly the player's movement. So to reach the key, I might need to trick it into a position I can access.

But that's another possible approach. If the key is moving, maybe I can create a path by moving walls or other objects to block its movement or guide it. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, since the key is the win, and it's currently blocked by walls, maybe I can change the ""win"" rule to something else that's accessible. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then just touching Baba would make me win. But how to do that? The current rules are ""key is win"", so I need to move the ""win"" block from the key to Baba. To do that, I need to find the ""win"" rule block, which is part of the ""key is win"" rule at 6 steps right and 4 up. So to change that rule, I would need to move the ""win"" block to the ""baba"" rule. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So the steps would","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is to get to the key, but since the key is set as win, maybe I need to change that? Or perhaps reach the key while being Baba, since ""baba is you"" means I control Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up from my current position. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, which is a stop. So I can't go through that. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the wall not a stop. The rule ""wall is stop"" is present, so if I can move that rule or change it, maybe I can pass through the wall.

There's a rule ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"". That's the original wall is stop rule. If I can move that text block, perhaps I can replace it with something else. But wait, can I move the rule blocks? The tip says I can move objects or text that are not defined as stop or similar. Since the rules themselves aren't stopped unless they have a stop property. The current active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the rules are active, but the text blocks that make up those rules are objects. Are the rule text blocks movable?

Yes, because the rules are formed by text blocks, and unless the text block is part of a stop rule, they can be moved. For example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is made by the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop' arranged horizontally. So if I can move those individual text blocks, I can create new rules.

Looking at the map, the rule `wall` is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. The 'is' next to it is at 1 step left and 3 step up, and 'stop' is at the same position as the 'is'? Wait, the observation says rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 up, rule `is` 1 step left and 3 up, rule `stop` 3 step up. Hmm, maybe they are in a vertical arrangement? Like wall is stop is split into three parts: wall above is, then is, then stop below? Not sure. But the key is that to change the wall from being a stop, I need to either delete the wall is stop rule or replace it with another rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key a you instead. If I can say key is you, then I can become the key and maybe walk over the wall. But right now, the active rule is key is win. So how to change that.

The key is located at 4 steps right and 3 up. There's also a rule `key` at 6 steps right and 4 up, part of the key is win rule. So maybe if I can move the 'win' text block from the key is win rule, then I can make the key something else.

But how to do that. Let's see. The current key is win rule is made by the text blocks at 4,5,6 steps right and 4 up: 'key', 'is', 'win'. If I can move the 'win' block, maybe I can replace it with 'you' or another property.

But to move those text blocks, I need to be adjacent to them. The player (Baba) is at a certain position. Let me check where Baba is. The objects list includes rule `baba` at 4 step left and 2 steps down. So Baba is located at 4 left and 2 down. So my position is 4 left, 2 down.

The key is at 4 steps right and 3 up from my position. So to reach the key's rule, which is at 6 right and 4 up, I need to move. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's think step by step.

First, I need to get to the rule blocks that make up the key is win rule. Those are at 4,5,6 right and 4 up. But to get there, I need to move through the map. But the walls are all to the right. For example, wall is 1 step right and 4 up, then steps down to 1 step right. So the right side is blocked by walls. But maybe I can move left or up?

Wait, the current position of Baba is 4 left and 2 down. The wall is 2 step left and 3 step up. So if I move up, maybe I can avoid the walls. Let's see.

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So as Baba, I can move unless there's a STOP in my way. The walls are STOP, so I can't move into them. So to navigate, I need to find paths that aren't blocked by walls.

Looking at the map layout:

- Upwards, there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, then the key is at 2 right and 3 up. Wait, no. The key is at 4 steps right and 3 step up from my current position. Wait, the observation says key is at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. So from my position (4 left, 2 down), moving right 4 steps and up 3 steps would get me to the key.

But the path is blocked by walls. Let's break it down:

From current position (4L, 2D):

- Moving right 1 step would be 3L, 2D. But there's a wall at 3 steps right (so assuming right is positive direction), wait the walls are listed as:

wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up

wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up

wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up

wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up

wall 1 step to the right

wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down

So all the walls are 1 step to the right in various directions. So if I move right from my position (4L, 2D), that would be 3L, 2D, which is not a wall. Wait, the walls are all at 1 step right relative to some other position? Maybe the coordinate system is relative to the player.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to visualize the grid.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at position (0,0). Then:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up would be at (1,4).

- rule `key` is at (4,4).

- The key object is at (2,3), since it's 4 steps right and 3 up from Baba's position (which would be (-4, -2) relative to the grid origin). Hmm, maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. This is tricky without a clear map.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out with Baba starting somewhere, and the objects are positioned relative to him. The observation lists each object's position relative to Baba. For example, 'wall 1 step to the right' is one step to the right of Baba, 'wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up' is one step right and four up from Baba, etc.

So, in this case, the key is located 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up from Baba. The walls are all clustered one step to the right in various directions. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall one step right and three up, which is a STOP. So I can't go through that.

To reach the key, I need to either move the wall rule or change the key's rule. Let's think about changing the key's rule. The key is part of the ""key is win"" rule, which is made up of the text blocks at (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). To change this rule, I need to move the 'win' text block. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move it.

Baba's current position is at the rule `baba` located 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So converting that to relative positions, if Baba is at (0,0), then the 'baba' rule is at (-4, -2). The 'key' rule is at (4,4), so that's 4 steps right and 4 up from Baba. The 'is' next to it is at (5,4), and 'win' at (6,4).

To reach the 'win' block at (6,4), I need to move from (0,0) right 6 steps and up 4, but the path is blocked by walls. For example, moving right 1 step to (1,0), but there's no wall there. Wait, the walls listed are all at 1 step right in some direction. So maybe the walls are in a vertical line one step to the right of Baba, from up 4 down to down 1. So Baba is at (0,0), and the walls are at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1). So all directly to the right of Baba.

So to get to the 'win' block at (6,4), I need to go around the walls. But moving left from Baba's position isn't possible because there's no indication of walls to the left. The only walls are to the right. So perhaps the only way is to go up over the walls? But moving up from (0,0) to (0,1), but there's no wall there. Wait, the walls are only at (1,y) for various y.

So maybe moving up and left? For example, from (0,0), move up to (0,1), then left to (-1,1), but can I move left? The active rules are wall is stop, but there's no wall to the left mentioned. So if I can move left, I can avoid the wall at (1,3) which is blocking the path to the key.

But how to get to the rule blocks. Let's think step by step.

First, I need to reach the 'win' text block at (6,4). To do that, I need to move right 6 steps and up 4, but the first step right is blocked by a wall at (1,4). So I can't go straight right. Maybe I can go around by moving up first.

From (0,0), move up to (0,1). Then, move right to (1,1). But (1,1) is a wall (since wall is at 1 step right and 1 step up from Baba). So that's a stop, can't enter. Next, try moving up again to (0,2). Then right to (1,2), which is another wall. This seems like all the walls are directly right of Baba, from up 4 to down 1.

Alternative path: Move up to (0,3), then right to (1,3), which is a wall. Still blocked. Hmm. Maybe move up past the walls? Let's see. The walls are at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1). So if I can get to a position above the walls, like (0,5), then move right. But how?

From (0,0), move up 5 steps to (0,5). Then right to (1,5), which is not a wall. Then right to (2,5), etc., towards the 'win' block at (6,4). But this requires navigating around the walls vertically.

But how to get to (0,5). Each move is one step. Let's see:

1. Up from (0,0) to (0,1)
2. Up to (0,2)
3. Up to (0,3)
4. Up to (0,4)
5. Up to (0,5)

Now at (0,5). Then move right to (1,5) – no wall there. Then right to (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Then down to (6,4), which is where the 'win' block is. But the 'win' block is part of the rule ""key is win"" at (6,4). So if I can get to (6,4), which is the 'win' text block, I can move it.

But moving from (6,5) down to (6,4) is possible if there's no wall there. Looking at the objects, the walls are only at (1,y) for various y. So (6,4) is safe to move into.

Once at (6,4), which is the 'win' text block, I can pick it up and move it. But wait, can I move text blocks? The rules say I can move objects or text that are not STOP. Since 'win' is a property (part of a rule), and the rule is ""key is win"", the individual text blocks 'key', 'is', 'win' are objects. Are they movable? Yes, unless they are part of a STOP rule. The current active rule is wall is stop, but the text blocks themselves aren't stopped unless they are part of a STOP rule. So yes, I can move the 'win' block.

So the plan is:

1. Navigate from Baba's position (0,0) up to (0,5).
2. Move right through (1,5) to (6,5).
3. Move down to (6,4) to reach the 'win' block.
4. Move the 'win' block to a different position to change the rule from ""key is win"" to something else, like ""key is you"".

But how to do that. Once I have the 'win' block at (6,4), I can move it left or right to form a new rule. For example, if I move 'win' to be after 'key' and 'is', but that would just reform the same rule. Alternatively, I can move 'win' next to another subject, like 'baba', to create ""baba is win"".

But the goal is to change the key's rule. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""win is push"" or something, but that might not help. Alternatively, make the key a you, so I can become the key and walk over the stop wall.

So if I can create ""key is you"", then since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", that might not help. Wait, no. ""baba is you"" means I control Baba. If I make ""key is you"", then the key becomes a you object. So I can move the key. But the key is located at (2,3) relative to Baba. So if I become the key, I can move to it.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Current active rules:

- key is win: So touching the key makes it win.
- wall is stop: Can't move through walls.
- baba is you: I control Baba.

If I can change the key's rule to ""key is you"", then the key becomes a you object. Since I'm you (Baba), I can move the key. Then, maybe move the key to the win position, or use the key to override the stop rule.

Alternatively, make the wall not a stop. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or something, allowing me to move through walls by pushing them.

But how to do that. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of the text blocks at (2,-1) relative to Baba? Wait, the rule `wall` is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So if Baba is at (0,0), then the 'wall' text block is at (-2, 3). The 'is' is at (-1,3), and 'stop' is at (0,3). So the rule ""wall is stop"" is arranged horizontally from (-2,3) to (0,3).

To change this rule, I need to move one of the text blocks. For example, moving the 'stop' to another position to form a new rule like ""wall is you"", making walls passable.

But to do that, I need to reach those text blocks. From Baba's position (0,0), the 'wall' rule is at (-2,3), which is two steps left and three up. That's quite far, and the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, focus on the key. If I can make the key a you, then I can move the key to the win position. But the key is at (2,3) relative to Baba. To get there, I need to move right and up, but the path is blocked by walls at (1,y) for y from 0 to 4.

Wait, maybe there's a way to move around the walls by going above them. For example, moving up to (0,5), then right to (1,5), which is not a wall, then right to (2,5), etc., down to (2,3), where the key is. But the key's position is 4 steps right and 3 up from Baba. So from (6,5), moving down four steps would get to (6,1), which is not the key's location. Hmm, maybe my coordinate system is off.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 4 steps right and 3 up from Baba's initial position. So if I move right 4 and up 3, avoiding the walls. But the walls are at 1 step right in all directions, so moving right 4 would require going around them.

This is really tricky without a visual map. Let's try to outline the possible steps again.

Objective: Reach the key to win, but the key is behind walls that are stop.

Possible solutions:

1. Change the ""key is win"" rule to ""key is you"", allowing me to move the key.
   - To do this, I need to move the 'win' text block from the ""key is win"" rule.
   - The 'win' block is at 6 steps right and 4 up from Baba.
   - Navigate to that block, move it elsewhere to form a new rule like ""key is you"".

2. Change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else, like ""wall is push"", allowing me to push through walls.
   - The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up.
   - Move the 'stop' block to form a new rule, e.g., ""wall is push"".

3. Make Baba a win by changing the rules, so","

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So my goal is to get the key because it's the win condition. But how?

Looking at the objects, there's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are right next to the key area. Since wall is stop, I can't go through them. But maybe I can move the rules to change what a wall is.

There's a rule ""wall is stop"" at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what defines a wall. But wait, can I move the text blocks? Only if they're not stopped. The rule ""stop"" is at 3 step up, but I'm not sure if that affects me. Since I'm Baba and baba is you, I can move unless there's a stop. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them, but I can move around them.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can combine that with ""is"" and ""you"" to make myself something else. For example, if I rearrange them to ""baba is you"" (which is already active), but maybe another rule like ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key"". But to do that, I need to move the existing text blocks.

The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up, behind a wall. So I need to get past that wall. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can go through it. To do that, I need to delete or change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. To move that rule, I have to be able to reach it. But the path is blocked by walls. Wait, the walls are on the right side. Maybe I can go around to the left side where the rules are.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 2 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"". If I can move those to create a new rule that makes Baba into a key or win, but first I need to reach them. The problem is that moving from my current position (assuming I'm at Baba's position, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down based on the rules) to the left side might be blocked by walls on the right. Wait, the walls on the right are 1 step right, 2 steps right, etc., up to 4 steps up. But the left side has rules. Maybe I can move left towards the rules.

So the plan is: move left past the walls on the right. Wait, but there's a wall 1 step to the right, which is directly in front of me if I'm at the starting point. But since baba is you, I can move unless there's a stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move into them. So I need to find a way around. Maybe move left from my current position. Let me check where I am. The rules for Baba are at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So my position is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To move left, that would be 5 steps left and 2 steps down. But are there walls there? The map shows walls at 1 step right, 2 steps right, etc., but nothing on the left side except the rules. So maybe moving left is possible.

Wait, but the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move unless there's a STOP. The walls are stop, so I can't step into them. So I need to navigate around the walls. The key is to the right and up, but blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to remove the stop property from walls. To do that, I need to pick up the ""wall"" rule, ""is"", and ""stop"" and rearrange them. But how?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. To get there, I need to move left and up. From my current position (4 left, 2 down), moving left once gets me to 5 left, 2 down. Then maybe up? But there might be walls blocking. Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""baba"" rule to create a new rule. For example, if I make ""baba is win"", then I could touch the key (which is win) to win. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks: take ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" and place them together.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. That's far away. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to the ""win"" rule's location. But how to reach there? There are walls on the right side. Alternatively, maybe combine the existing ""baba is you"" with another rule.

Wait, the key is currently the win object. So touching the key would win. But the key is behind walls. So maybe the solution is to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule so that walls are no longer stop. Then I can move through them. To delete a rule, I need to move the text blocks that make it up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". If I can move those three blocks away or rearrange them, the rule would be broken.

So the plan is: move to the ""wall is stop"" rule's location (2 left, 3 up) and move the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" blocks to break the rule. Then walls are no longer stop, and I can walk through them to get to the key.

But how to get there? From my current position (4 left, 2 down), I need to move left 2 steps and up 1 step. Let's see:

Current position: 4 left, 2 down.

To reach 2 left, 3 up:

- Move left twice: positions 5 left, 2 down → 6 left, 2 down → 7 left, 2 down. Wait, no, each left moves one step left. So from 4 left, moving left once is 5 left, then 6 left. But the target is 2 left. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system. The observations mention steps to the right, left, up, down. So if the rule `wall` is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps up from somewhere, maybe the coordinate system is relative.

Alternatively, perhaps the position of objects is relative to Baba's position. The problem is that without knowing Baba's exact starting position, it's tricky. But in the observations, the rules for Baba are at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So maybe Baba is at the origin (0,0), and other objects are positioned relative to that.

In that case, the rule `baba` is at 4 left, 2 down. So to move left from there, it would be increasing the left steps. But the walls are on the right side. So to get to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 left and 3 up, from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), I need to move right (reducing the left steps) and up.

Wait, if left is negative direction, then moving right would be adding to the right steps. Maybe the coordinate system is such that each direction step changes the position accordingly. For example, moving left from 4 left would be 4-1=3 left, etc.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to visualize:

Baba's position: Assuming the rules for Baba are at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, so maybe Baba is at (0,0), and the rule `baba` is at (-4, -2).

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up from somewhere. Wait, the observation says: ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up"". So the rule `wall` is 4 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba's position? Or from another object? The description says ""Objects on the map: [object] position relative to something else.""

This is unclear. Maybe all positions are relative to Baba's position. For example, the first wall is 1 step to the right and 4 steps up from Baba. So if Baba is at (0,0), that wall is at (1,4).

Similarly, the rule `key` is 4 steps right and 4 up from Baba, so at (4,4).

The ""wall is stop"" rule is 4 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba, so at (-4,3).

The goal is to get to the key at (4,4), but there's a wall at (1,4), (2,4), etc., blocking the path.

To get past the wall at (1,4), I need to make it not a stop. To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is made of three parts: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". They are probably arranged in a row. The ""wall"" rule is at (-4,3), ""is"" at (-3,3), and ""stop"" at (-2,3).

So to break this rule, I need to move one of these blocks. But can I? Only if they're not stopped. The rule ""stop"" is at (-2,3), but I'm not sure if that affects the movability of the other blocks. Since ""wall is stop"" is the rule, and wall is stop, but the blocks themselves (like ""is"" and ""stop"") are not necessarily stopped. So maybe I can pick up the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks and move them away.

If I can move the ""is"" block from (-3,3) to another position, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Similarly, moving the ""stop"" block would also break the rule.

So the plan is: move to the ""is"" block at (-3,3) and push it away. But how to move there? From Baba's position at (0,0), need to go left 3 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls on the way. For example, moving left once gets to (-1,0), which is probably not a wall. Wait, the walls are at (1,4), (2,4), etc. So moving left from Baba's position is safe. So from (0,0), move left to (-1,0), then left again to (-2,0), then left to (-3,0), then up to (-3,1), (-3,2), (-3,3). But along the way, are there any walls?

The walls are all on the right side, so moving left should be clear. Once at (-3,3), which is the ""is"" block of the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move it. Then the rule would be broken, making walls not stop. Then I can walk through the walls and reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""stop"" block instead. The ""stop"" block is at (-2,3). So moving from (0,0) to (-2,3) would require moving left 2 steps and up 3 steps. That's possible if there are no walls in between. Since the walls are on the right, moving left should be fine.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left from (0,0) to (-1,0).
2. Move left again to (-2,0).
3. Move up to (-2,1).
4. Move up again to (-2,2).
5. Move up to (-2,3), which is the ""stop"" block.
6. Move the ""stop"" block somewhere else, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can go through them. Then navigate to the key at (4,4), avoiding the walls since they're no longer stops.

Alternatively, after breaking the rule, I can go directly right to the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? In the game, you can push objects (like text blocks) if they're not defined as stop. But since ""wall is stop"", but the ""stop"" block itself isn't a wall, maybe it's movable. So once I reach (-2,3), I can move the ""stop"" block left or right.

For example, move the ""stop"" block 1 step left to (-3,3), which was the position of the ""is"" block. Now the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because the ""is"" and ""stop"" are separated.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block down or up.

Once the rule is broken, proceed to the key.

Another approach: Create a new rule that makes Baba a key or win. For example, ""baba is key"" or ""baba is win"". Since baba is you, if you become win, touching anything would win. Or if you become key, touching the key (which is win) would still win.

To do that, need to rearrange the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" or ""key"" blocks.

The ""win"" block is at (8,4), which is far to the right. The ""key"" block is at (4,4). The ""baba"" rule is at (-4, -2). So maybe it's easier to go for the ""key is win"" rule. If I can change that to ""baba is win"", then touching anything would make me win.

But how to reach the ""win"" block? It's at (8,4), blocked by walls. But if I break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move through walls. So first break the rule, then go to the key or rearrange the rules.

Alternatively, after breaking ""wall is stop"", move to the ""key is win"" rule at (4,4) and change it to ""baba is win"".

So steps:

1. Break ""wall is stop"" by moving ""stop"" block.
2. Move through walls to the key area.
3. Take the ""key is win"" rule and rearrange to ""baba is win"".

But how to do that? The ""key is win"" rule is composed of ""key"" at (4,4), ""is"" at (5,4), ""win"" at (6,4). To change this to ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""key"" block to where ""baba"" is, which is at (-4,-2). That's a long distance.

Alternatively, maybe take the ""baba"" rule from (-4,-2), move it to the ""key is win"" area, and rearrange.

This seems complicated. Maybe the quicker solution is to first break the ""wall is stop"" rule, then go to the key and touch it, since key is win.

So breaking the rule first:

Move left from Baba's position (0,0) to (-2,3) where the ""stop"" block is, then move it left to (-3,3). Now the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken.

Then, since walls are no longer stop, I can move through them. Navigate right from (0,0) past the walls at (1,4), etc., but wait, the walls are on the right side at (1,4), (2,4), etc., but after breaking the rule, walking through them doesn't stop me.

So go right to (1,0), (2,0), etc., up to (4,4) where the key is. But the key is at (4,4), which is blocked by walls even after breaking ""wall is stop""? No, because the walls are objects that are stop only if the rule exists. Since the rule is broken, walls are just walls, not stop, so I can walk through them.

So path from (0,0) to (4,4):

Right to (4,0), up to (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). But along the way, at (4,4) is the key. But there's a wall at (4,4) defined by the ""key is win"" rule? No, the key is the win object. The walls are separate. So if I can reach (4,4), touching the key (which is win) would win the level.

But how to get past the walls on the way? For example, when moving up from (4,0) to (4,1), is there a wall there? The map shows walls at 1 step right and 1 step up, 2 steps right and 1 step up, etc. So at (4,1), is there a wall? According to the objects listed, the walls are at 1 step right and 4 up, 2 steps right and 3 up, etc. It seems that the walls are mainly on the right side higher up. So moving right to (4,0) is clear. Then up to (4,4) should be clear except for the key's position, which is the win condition.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. So (4,3). The wall at 4 steps right and 4 up is separate. So moving from (4,3) (key's position) up to (4,4) would be possible, as there's no wall there.

So after breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, the path to the key is clear. Then move right to (4,0), up to (4,4), and touch the key to win.

Therefore, the actions needed are:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at (-2,3) and move it away to break the rule.
2. Move right to (4,0), then up to (4,4) and take the key.

But how to give the correct sequence of actions? The game requires one action at a time.

The first action should be to move towards the ""stop"" block. From Baba's position (0,0), the direction to (-2,3) is left twice and up three times.

So the movement would be:

left, left, up, up, up.

But each action is a single step. So the sequence would be five actions: left, left, up, up, up.

But the user expects one action per observation. Since the previous attempts failed, maybe the assistant needs to output the first action, like 'left' to start moving towards the stop block.

Alternatively, maybe the assistant needs to directly jump to the","

13,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, I need to get the key, which is currently set as the win condition. That probably means grabbing the key will make me win. But moving might be tricky because walls are stop, and if I touch them, I can't move past them.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, but the observation shows that the key is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up relative to my current position. But the walls are also clustered to the right. So maybe I need to navigate around them.

Wait, the player is Baba, right? Because baba is you. So I need to move Baba to the key. The key is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up from where I am. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps up is there. So moving directly right and up would hit a wall. Maybe I need to find another path.

Looking at the rules, maybe I can change them. The rule blocks are at the top left. There's a rule 'baba' 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down, then 'is' and 'you'. If I can move those text blocks, I could change the rules. For example, if I make 'baba' 'win' or remove the 'stop' property from walls.

But how do I move the text blocks? They need to be not part of a 'stop' or similar rule. The existing rules are wall is stop, so walls are immovable. But the text blocks like 'key', 'is', 'win', 'wall', etc., are separate. Are they movable? The tip says you can move objects or text that aren't defined as stop. Since the rules themselves are text blocks, maybe they can be moved if they're not part of a stop rule.

So the rule 'stop' is at 2 steps to the left and 3 step up. That's part of the wall is stop rule. So the text blocks that make up the rules might be movable. For example, the 'stop' text block is 2 steps to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that, maybe I can remove the wall is stop rule.

But first, I need to reach those text blocks. The current position of Baba is at the position of the rule 'baba' which is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, in the latest observation, the rule 'baba' is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So my current position is there. The other text blocks are further left and up. To get to them, I need to move left and up, but there might be walls in the way.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up, then more walls descending down. On the left side, there's a wall 4 steps to the left and 3 step up. So moving left from my current position (2 steps left, 2 down) might be blocked by walls? Wait, the walls are to the right mostly, except for the ones at the top left. So maybe moving left is possible.

Wait, the current position of Baba is at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So from there, if I move left again, that's 3 steps left and 2 down. Are there walls there? The objects listed include walls at 4 steps left and 3 step up, which is not in the same area. So maybe I can move left.

But the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move unless there's a stop. The walls are stop, but the text blocks aren't. So I should be able to move left past the other walls.

The goal is to get the key. The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. But the path is blocked by walls. So maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make 'baba' 'win', then touching the key or any other object would make me win. Or, remove the 'stop' property from walls so I can move through them.

To do that, I need to find the 'stop' rule and either move it or change it. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So from my current position (2 left, 2 down), I need to move left once and up three steps. Let's see: left once gets me to 3 left, 2 down. Then up three steps would be 3 left, -1 (since up decreases the down steps). But the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So maybe my movement is a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first move towards the 'stop' rule. From my current position (rule `baba` 2 left, 2 down), moving left once to 3 left, 2 down. Then up three times: up, up, up. That would get me to 3 left, -1 (which is 1 step up from the starting point?). Wait, the coordinate system might be a bit confusing. Each step up or down changes the position relative to the starting point.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are relative. So if I'm at position X, moving up takes me to X's up direction. But in any case, the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So from my current position (2 left, 2 down), moving left once to 3 left, 2 down. Then up three times to 3 left, -1 (since each up cancels a down). That would place me at 3 left, -1, which is 1 left and 3 up from the original position. Wait, maybe not. The exact coordinate system isn't clear, but the key idea is to reach the 'stop' rule text block to delete it.

Once I delete the 'stop' rule, walls would no longer be stop, and I could walk through them. Then I could go straight to the key. Alternatively, if I can make 'baba' 'win', then just touching the key or any object would make me win.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule (1 left, 3 up) and remove it by moving it off the grid or combining it with another rule.
2. Alternatively, move to the 'baba' rule and change it to 'win'.

But moving the 'stop' rule would require picking it up and placing it somewhere else. Since the 'stop' rule is part of the wall is stop rule, if we remove the 'stop' text block, the rule wall is stop would be broken.

So, to do that, I need to grab the 'stop' text block and move it. Let's see where the 'stop' text block is located. In the latest observation, the rule `stop` is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. From my current position (rule `baba` at 2 left, 2 down), moving left once to 3 left, 2 down. Then up three times: up, up, up. That would get me to 3 left, -1 (assuming each up decreases the down count by one). But the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So maybe my current position is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. So if the 'stop' rule is 1 step to the left and 3 up from Baba, then moving left once and up three times would reach it.

Once I reach the 'stop' rule, I can move it away, say, to the right, making the wall is stop rule invalid. Then walls are no longer stop, and I can walk through them to get to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can combine the 'stop' rule with another rule to delete it. But the game usually requires moving text blocks to form new rules or delete existing ones by separating them.

So the plan is:

- Move to the 'stop' text block (1 left, 3 up) from Baba's current position.
- Pick it up and move it somewhere else, like to the right beyond the wall, so the wall is stop rule is broken.

But how to move? Each action is a single step. So from current position (Baba at 2 left, 2 down):

To get to 'stop' at 1 left, 3 up:

From 2 left, 2 down:

Move left once to 3 left, 2 down.

Then move up three times: up, up, up. That would be to 3 left, -1 (since each up reduces the down by 1). But the 'stop' is at 1 left, 3 up. So this path might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are such that each step up from the current position changes the 'up' coordinate. So starting at position (0,0), moving up takes you to (0,1), etc. But the problem is the exact coordinate system isn't clear from the observations.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'stop' rule is located to the left and up relative to Baba's current position. So moving left and up step by step.

Alternatively, maybe the key is behind the walls, and the only way is to remove the stop rule. So the priority is to reach the 'stop' text block and move it.

But each move is a single step. So from Baba's current position (which is at the 'baba' rule, 2 left, 2 down), let's see:

To get to the 'stop' rule at 1 left, 3 up:

The difference is (1 left - 2 left) = -1 left (so move right once), and (3 up - 2 down) = 5 up. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the coordinates are absolute, but the problem is that the observations don't provide Baba's absolute position, just relative positions of objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are relative to the player's current position. So '1 step to the right' means from the player's current position, move right.

In that case, the 'stop' rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up from the player. So to reach it, the player needs to move left once and up three times.

So from current position:

Move left once → position now is 1 left, 2 down.

Then move up three times:

1. Up → 1 left, 1 down.

2. Up → 1 left, 0 down.

3. Up → 1 left, -1 down (which is 1 up).

Now at 1 left, 1 up. But the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So need to move up two more times.

Wait, maybe the initial position of the 'stop' rule is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up from the player's current position. So after moving left once, the player is at 1 left, 2 down. Then moving up three times would get to 1 left, 2 down - 3 = 1 left, -1 down (which is 1 up). But the 'stop' is at 3 up, so need to move up two more times from there.

So total steps: left, up, up, up, up, up. That's moving left once and up five times. But that seems like a lot, and maybe there's a wall in the way.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps left and 3 step up, which is not in the way. The walls on the right are blocking the path to the key, but moving left towards the 'stop' rule might be clear.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Once I reach the 'stop' rule, I can pick it up and move it. Then the wall is stop rule is broken, allowing me to pass through walls.

Another option is to create a new rule that makes Baba win. For example, if I can make 'baba' 'win' by combining the 'baba' text block with 'win' and 'is'.

The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The 'win' rule is 6 steps right and 4 up from the key's position, but in the latest observation, the 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up. Wait, the objects are listed with their positions relative to something. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'stop' rule first. Let's try to navigate there.

From current position (2 left, 2 down):

Move left once to 3 left, 2 down.

Then move up five times to reach 3 left, -3 down (which is 3 up). But the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So this path might overshoot.

Alternatively, adjust the movement. Maybe move left once, then up three times to reach 1 left, -1 (which is 1 up), but the 'stop' is at 3 up. So need to move up two more times from there. But that would be total of left once and up five times.

But perhaps there's a wall blocking the way. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. Wait, the rule 'stop' is at 1 left and 3 up. So moving left once and up three times would pass through the area where there's a wall at 2 left and 3 up? No, that's two steps left from the starting position, but the player is moving to 1 left and 3 up. So maybe that wall is not in the path.

This is getting a bit too confusing without a visual map. But the key idea is to reach the 'stop' rule and remove it. Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, and the player can move through them to the key.

Alternatively, if the player can make themselves win by changing the 'baba' rule to 'win'. To do that, the player needs to move the 'baba' text block, 'is', and 'win' together to form ""BABA IS WIN"".

The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 2 down. The 'is' is at 3 left, 2 down. The 'win' is at 8 steps right and 4 up, but that's probably on the opposite side. Wait, in the latest observation, the 'win' rule is 7 steps to the right and 4 up from the key's position. But the player is on the left side. So moving right would be difficult due to walls.

Another approach: If the player can push the key to themselves. Since the key is win, if the player grabs the key, they become win. But how to pick up the key? The rules don't mention 'baba' can hold objects, but in Baba Is You, sometimes you can push objects if the rules allow.

But the current rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. There's no rule about pushing or holding. So maybe the player can move the key by moving it adjacent to themselves.

The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up from the player's current position. So to get to the key, the player would need to move right and up, but there are walls blocking the path.

For example, the wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up is directly in the path. So moving right three times and up three times would hit that wall. Unless the wall is no longer stop after removing the 'stop' rule.

So the priority is to remove the 'stop' rule. Let's try to move to the 'stop' text block.

From current position (Baba at 2 left, 2 down):

Move left once to 3 left, 2 down.

Then move up five times: up, up, up, up, up. This would position the player at 3 left, -3 down (which is 3 up). But the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So this path is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the directions are different. If 'up' is a different direction, perhaps the player needs to move in a different way.

This is quite challenging without a clear map. Another idea: Since the key is win, and the player is Baba (baba is you), maybe the solution is to touch the key. But to reach the key, the player needs to navigate through the walls. If the walls are stop, they can't. So the only way is to remove the stop property from walls.

To do that, remove the 'stop' rule. So the plan is to move to the 'stop' text block and move it away.

Assuming the player can move left and up, let's try:

1. Move left once (to 3 left, 2 down).

2. Move up three times (to 3 left, -1 down, which is 1 up).

But the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So from 3 left, 1 up, need to move left two more times and up two more times.

So:

3. Move left twice: to 1 left, 1 up.

4. Move up two times: to 1 left, 3 up (which is the 'stop' rule's position).

Once there, the player can pick up the 'stop' text block and move it. For example, move right to 2 left, 3 up, then down to 2 left, 2 down. This would move the 'stop' rule off the relevant position, breaking the wall is stop rule.

After that, walls are no longer stop, and the player can move through them. Then go to the key's location.

So the sequence of actions would be:

left, up, up, up, left, left, up, up, right, down.

But each action is a single step, and the player needs to type each step.

But maybe there's a more efficient way. Alternatively, once the 'stop' rule is removed, the player can go around the walls to the key.

Alternatively, another approach: Make Baba the winner by creating the rule ""BABA IS WIN"".

To do that, the player needs to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks together.

The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 2 down.

The 'is' rule is at 3 left, 2 down.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 4 up (from the key's position, which is 4 right, 3 up).

But the player is on the left side, so moving right to reach the 'win' rule would require passing through walls, which are stop unless the 'stop' rule is removed.

This seems complicated. So the safest bet is to remove the 'stop' rule first.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to get the key and reach the win condition. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So right now, if I pick up the key, it becomes the win condition. But there are walls that are stop, meaning I can't move through them.

Looking at the map, I'm probably the Baba object since baba is you. Let me check the objects. There's a key at 4 steps right and 3 steps up from my position. But there are walls in the way. The wall is 1 step to the right at 3 steps up, and another at 2 steps up, 1 step up, etc. So moving straight right isn't possible because of the walls.

Wait, the walls are all aligned to the right. Maybe I need to move left to get past them. The key is to the right, but the walls are blocking. If I can move left, perhaps there's a path. There's a rule at 2 steps left and 2 steps down for 'baba is you', but I'm not sure how that helps. 

The other rules are key is win, wall is stop. So maybe if I can change some rules. For example, if I can remove the wall's stop property or make myself not stop. But how? To do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule 'wall is stop' is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule somewhere else or replace it, maybe I can walk through walls.

Alternatively, if I can make the key the you instead of baba, then stepping on the key would make me the you. But the active rules say baba is you. So to change that, I need to rearrange the 'baba is you' rule. The components are at 4 steps left and 2 steps down for 'baba', 'is' at 3 steps left and 2 steps down, and 'you' at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move these pieces to form a new rule, like 'key is you', then the key would become the player.

But moving those text blocks requires that they're not stopped. The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 step up. So to move the 'baba', 'is', 'you' texts, I need to go left past the walls. Let me check the movement. If I'm currently at the position of the baba object, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down relative to some point. Wait, the observation lists the objects' positions relative to the player? Or is it a grid?

The observation says objects are positioned relative to the player. For example, 'wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up' means there's a wall one step right and four up from the player. So the player is somewhere, and all objects are positioned relative to that.

So the player (Baba) is likely at the position where the 'rule baba' is not listed, but given that 'baba is you' is an active rule, the player is the Baba object. Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `baba`' at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So the player is maybe at the origin, and that rule is four steps left and two down. 

To move the 'baba', 'is', 'you' rules to create a new rule like 'key is you', the player needs to navigate to those text blocks and rearrange them. The 'baba' rule is 4 left and 2 down, 'is' is 3 left and 2 down, 'you' is 2 left and 2 down. So they form a horizontal line to the left. To pick them up, the player needs to move left past the walls. But there are walls at 1 step right, 2 steps right, etc., which are blocking the right path. However, moving left might be possible if there's a path.

Looking at the walls: the player is at position (assuming origin), and walls are to the right at various positions up and down. But to the left, there's a rule at 4 left, 2 down. So moving left step by step. Let's see:

Current position: Let's assume the player is at (0,0).

Walls:
- 1 step right and 4 up: (1,4)
- 1 step right and 3 up: (1,3)
- 1 step right and 2 up: (1,2)
- 1 step right and 1 up: (1,1)
- 1 step right: (1,0)
- 1 step right and 1 down: (1,-1)
- Also a wall at 2 steps right and 2 down: (2,-2)

Rules related to baba:
- 'baba' rule at (-4, -2)
- 'is' at (-3, -2)
- 'you' at (-2, -2)

So the player needs to move left to reach (-4, -2) to get the 'baba' text, then move right to collect 'is' and 'you'. But moving left from (0,0) would require passing through areas without walls? Let's check the walls. The walls are all to the right. There's a wall at (2,-2) which is two steps right and two steps down, but to the left, from (0,0), there are no walls mentioned. So the player can move left freely, except for the rules that are placed.

So the plan could be:

1. Move left to gather the 'baba', 'is', 'you' text blocks.
2. Rearrange them to create 'key is you', making the key the player.
3. Then move right to the key, which is now a win condition.

But first, need to navigate left past the existing rules. Let's see the objects on the left:

At (-1,0): Are there any walls? The listed walls are all to the right. So moving left should be possible.

Steps to take:

- Move left to get to the 'baba' rule at (-4, -2). That's a4-step left and 2 steps down. But moving diagonally might not be allowed; only up, down, left, right. So need to move left 4 steps and down 2 steps.

But that's a long way. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, since the key is at (4,3) relative to the player, which is far to the right, but the walls block that path. So changing the rules seems necessary.

Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at (-1,3) (2 steps left and 3 step up from player). If I can move that 'stop' rule elsewhere, perhaps the walls would no longer be stop. But to move it, need to go to its position, pick it up, and move it. But moving left to (-1,3) would require passing through open spaces.

So possible steps:

1. Move left 1 step to (-1,0). No walls there.
2. Move left another step to (-2,0).
3. Continue left to (-3,0), (-4,0), etc., until reaching (-4,-2) to get the 'baba' rule.
But this might take many steps. Alternatively, check if there's a quicker way.

Alternatively, since the key is win, if I can pick up the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. So perhaps changing the 'wall is stop' rule to something else. For example, moving the 'stop' property to another object.

The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of 'wall' at (-2,3), 'is' at (-3,3), 'stop' at (-1,3). To change this rule, I need to rearrange these texts. If I can move 'stop' to another object, like 'key is stop', then walls would not be stop anymore. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule 'baba is stop', but that would make Baba stop, which is bad.

Alternatively, move the 'stop' text to another part of a rule. For example, take 'stop' from 'wall is stop' and attach it to 'key is ...', making 'key is stop', which would block the key. Not helpful.

Alternatively, remove the 'stop' property from walls by deleting the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, need to move all three parts of the rule ('wall', 'is', 'stop') away from each other so the rule is broken.

For example, move 'wall' to a different position, 'is' elsewhere, and 'stop' elsewhere. Then the 'wall is stop' rule is deactivated.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then I can go right to the key and pick it up, which is win.

So steps:

1. Navigate to the 'wall is stop' rule components:
   - 'wall' at (-2,3)
   - 'is' at (-3,3)
   - 'stop' at (-1,3)

2. Move each of these texts to different positions to break the rule.

For example:

- Move 'wall' to (-2,4)
- Move 'is' to (-3,2)
- Move 'stop' to (-1,2)

This would break the 'wall is stop' rule.

Then, since walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them and reach the key at (4,3). Pick up the key, which makes it the win condition. Then move to the key to win.

But how to move the text blocks? Each text block must be moved one by one, and the movement is step by step.

So first, move from player's position (0,0) to the 'stop' text at (-1,3).

Path:

- Move left 1 step to (-1,0)
- Move up 3 steps to (-1,3) to reach 'stop'.

Once there, take the 'stop' text and move it. Let's say move it down to (-1,2).

Then move to 'is' at (-3,3). From (-1,3), move left 2 steps to (-3,3), then move up or down. Let's move it to (-3,2).

Then move to 'wall' at (-2,3). From (-3,3), move right 1 step to (-2,3), then move up to (-2,4).

Now the 'wall is stop' rule is broken. Walls are no longer stop.

Then, move right through the walls to the key at (4,3).

But the path is blocked by walls at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1). But since walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them.

So move right step by step:

- From (0,0) to (1,0) (wall, but not stop)
- Then right to (2,0)
- Continue right to (3,0)
- Up to (3,1)
- Up to (3,2)
- Up to (3,3) where the key is.

Pick up the key, which is now win. Then move to the key's position, which is already there, so maybe just stand there. But need to ensure that after picking up the key, the 'key is win' rule is active. Since the original rule is still there, key remains win. So picking up the key would make the player the key, and since key is win, touching it would win.

So the sequence would be:

Break the 'wall is stop' rule by moving its components.

Then move right through the now-passable walls to the key and claim victory.

Alternatively, if breaking the rule isn't possible, maybe create a new rule to make Baba the win.

But the initial plan seems feasible. So the first action should be moving left to start breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which right now is the key. But the active rule says ""key is win,"" so touching the key would make me win. However, the walls are labeled as stop, so I can't move through them.

Looking at the map, Baba is me (""baba is you""), so I need to move around. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. There are walls blocking the path. The rules are scattered, so maybe I can rearrange them to change the walls into something I can move through.

The structures on the right side have walls stacked down, from 4 steps right and 4 up down to 4 steps right. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 up, which seems just to the right of the wall at 4 steps right and 3 up. But since walls are stop, I can't go through them. So maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to remove the stop property from walls, making them passable.

Looking at the rule objects, there's a ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" and a ""rule `is` 3 step up"". Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of the ""wall"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""stop"" text block. If I can move these text blocks to create a new rule, like ""stop is wall"" or something else that changes the properties, that might help.

But first, I need to reach the key. To get past the walls blocking the path, maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" text block to another part, like making ""stop"" a different property. For example, if I can create ""stop is you"" or ""you is stop,"" that might allow me to move through walls because I'd be considered stop. Wait, but if I'm you and stop, does that mean I can't move? That might not be good.

Alternatively, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you,"" then walls would be passable, and I could walk through them. Or maybe change ""stop"" to something else. Let's see where the text blocks are located.

The current ""wall is stop"" rule is at positions:
- rule `wall` 4 step left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 3 step left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step left and 3 step up

So these three are forming the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" text block elsewhere, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through walls. For example, moving the ""stop"" to make ""stop is key"" or something. But the key is the win object, so that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that says ""you can pass through walls"" by rearranging the existing text blocks. Let's see. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"". If I can move ""you"" to another part, maybe making ""baba is win"" so that I become the win object. Wait, the active rule says ""key is win,"" so if I can change that to ""baba is win,"" then touching me would make me win. That could be a possible solution.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block from the key's rule to the baba's rule. The key's rule is at 6 steps right and 4 up (rule `key`), then `is` at 5 right and 4 up, then `win` at 4 right and 4 up. The baba's rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, with `baba`, `is`, and `you`.

So if I can move the `win` text block from the key's rule to the baba's rule, creating ""baba is win"" and ""key is ... something else"". But how do I move the text blocks? The user can move objects that are not stop. So, the text blocks are objects, but their properties might affect whether they can be moved. Since the current rules are ""wall is stop"", but the text blocks for rules might not be considered walls unless specified. Wait, the ""rule `wall`"" is a text block, but according to the active rules, walls are stop. So any object that is a wall is stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be walls unless they are part of a rule that defines them as such.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the text blocks that form a rule are part of the rule. For example, the three text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" form the rule ""wall is stop"". So the individual text blocks (like the ""stop"" block) can be moved if they are not part of a ""STOP"" property. But in this case, the ""stop"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, so maybe it's considered stop? Or is it a separate object?

This is a bit confusing. Let me think. The active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". The objects on the map include various walls and rules. The rule objects are like ""rule `key` 4 steps to the right..."", which are separate entities. So the text blocks themselves (like the ""stop"" block) are part of the rule objects. But if a rule is active that makes something stop, like ""wall is stop"", then any wall object is stop, but the text blocks might not be unless they are part of a wall rule.

So perhaps I can move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else. For example, if I can create a new rule like ""stop is key"", that might change things. But how do I do that?

To move a text block, I need to be able to move the rule object that contains it. For instance, the ""rule `wall` 4 step left and 3 step up"" is a single object that contains the ""wall"" text. Similarly, the ""rule `is` 3 step left..."" contains the ""is"" text, and the ""rule `stop` 2 step left..."" contains the ""stop"" text. So these are three separate rule objects that together make the ""wall is stop"" rule.

If I can move any of these rule objects, I can rearrange the texts. So, for example, if I move the ""rule `stop`"" object to be next to the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `is`"", then they would form a new rule ""baba is stop"", which would make Baba a stop, meaning I can't move. That's bad.

Alternatively, if I can take the ""stop"" text block and attach it to the ""key"" rule, making ""key is stop"", but the key is already win. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, the goal is to get to the key, which is win. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are to the right and up from the key. Maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is you"", then walls would be passable because I'm you. Let's see how that would work.

To do that, I need to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule into ""wall is you"". The current rule consists of three objects: rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. If I can move the ""stop"" object and replace it with the ""you"" object, that would create ""wall is you"". But where is the ""you"" object? The ""you"" object is part of the ""baba is you"" rule, located at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So the ""rule `you`"" is at that position.

So the plan is: move the ""rule `you`"" object next to the ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `is`"" objects to form ""wall is you"". That way, walls become passable, and I can walk through them to reach the key.

But how to do that? I need to navigate to the location of the ""rule `you`"" object, which is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. From my current position (assuming I'm Baba, who is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 step left and 2 steps down), I need to move to the ""rule `you`"" at 2 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, so Baba is there. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So to get there, I need to move left twice and stay at the same vertical position.

But the path might be blocked. Let's check the objects around. From the current observation, the walls are at various positions. The walls to the right are from 4 steps right up to 4 steps right down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So moving left from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) to 2 left, 2 down would require moving left twice. But are there any walls in between?

Looking at the objects on the map: there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, but that's to the right of Baba's current position. The path to the left seems clear except for the walls that are two steps to the right, which are above and below. So moving left twice should be possible if there are no walls in between. But need to confirm.

The objects listed include walls at various positions, but the ones around the current area: wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up, then lower walls. The immediate left of Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) is towards 3 left, then 2 left. Are there walls there? The observation shows walls at 1 step right and various positions, but to the left of Baba, there are no walls mentioned. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left, 2 down, and the ""rule `you`"" is at 2 left, 2 down. So moving left twice should be possible.

Once I reach the ""rule `you`"" object, I can then move it next to the ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `is`"" to form ""wall is you"". That would make walls passable. Then I can walk through the walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can change the ""key is win"" rule to ""baba is win"", making me the win object. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block from the key's rule to the baba's rule.

The key's rule is at 6 steps right and 4 up (rule `key`), then `is` at 5 right and 4 up, then `win` at 4 right and 4 up. The baba's rule is at 4 left and 2 down. So I would need to move the ""win"" block from the key's rule to the baba's rule. To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" block, pick it up, and move it to the baba's rule location.

But how to move the blocks? The rules are made of text blocks that can be moved if they are not part of a STOP object. Since the current rules don't make text blocks stop, except for walls, maybe the text blocks can be moved. So if I can move the ""win"" block from the key's rule to the baba's rule, that would create ""baba is win"".

To do that, I need to move to the position of the ""win"" block, which is 4 steps right and 4 up. From Baba's current position (4 left, 2 down), moving up 4 steps and right 8 steps would get to the ""win"" block. But there are walls at 4 steps right and various up positions. For example, wall at 4 right and 4 up is part of the key's rule's position. Wait, the key is at 4 right and 3 up, with walls above and below. So moving from Baba's position to the ""win"" block would require passing through or around walls.

Alternatively, if I can make walls passable by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule, then I can move through them. So first, change walls to not stop, then go through them to reach the key or the ""win"" block.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the ""rule `you`"" to form ""wall is you"", making walls passable.
2. Walk through the walls to reach the key or the ""win"" block.
3. Then, change the ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" block to the baba's rule.

But let's break it down.

First, to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule into ""wall is you"":

- The current ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three objects:
  - rule `wall` at 4 left, 3 up
  - rule `is` at 3 left, 3 up
  - rule `stop` at 2 left, 3 up

- The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 left, 2 down.

So I need to move the ""rule `stop`"" object and replace it with ""rule `you`"". To do that, I need to move the ""rule `you`"" next to the ""rule `wall`"" and ""rule `is`"".

But how to move these objects? Since I'm Baba, and the rules may not affect my ability to move unless I'm stopped. The current rules are ""wall is stop"", but I'm Baba, who is ""you"". So unless I'm part of a stop rule, I can move. Since ""baba is you"" and there's no ""you is stop"" rule, I can move.

So I should move towards the ""rule `you`"" object. From my current position at 4 left, 2 down, I need to go left twice to reach 2 left, 2 down. The path is clear except for possible walls. Looking at the objects, there are walls at 1 step right and various positions, but to the left of Baba, there are no walls mentioned. So moving left twice should be possible.

Once I reach the ""rule `you`"" at 2 left, 2 down, I can then move it to the area of the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. So I need to move the ""rule `you`"" from 2 left, 2 down to, say, 3 left, 3 up, next to the ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 up. Then, the three objects would be ""rule `wall`"", ""rule `is`"", ""rule `you`"", forming ""wall is you"".

This would change the property of walls to you, meaning they are passable. Then I can walk through the walls to the key.

Alternatively, after changing walls to you, I can go to the key's location at 5 right, 3 up, which is win. But I need to navigate past the walls. Since walls are now you, I can move through them.

But wait, if walls are you, does that mean I can push them or move through them? In Baba Is You, if an object is you, you can move through it, but you can't push it unless there's a rule allowing it. So if walls are you, I can move through them, but I can't push them out of the way. So I can go around them or through them.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""rule `you`"" to the ""wall is stop"" rule to make ""wall is you"".
2. Move through the now passable walls to reach the key.
3. Since the key is win, touching it would make me win.

But how to move the ""rule `you`"" object. To move a rule object, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The rule objects are like any other object; if they're not stop, I can move them. Since ""you"" is my property, and there's no ""you is stop"" rule, I can move the ""rule `you`"" object.

So from my position at 4 left, 2 down, I need to move left twice to reach the ""rule `you`"" at 2 left, 2 down. Then, move the ""rule `you`"" object to the area of the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, move it up to 2 left, 3 up, placing it next to the ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 up. Then the three rule objects would be ""wall"", ""is"", ""you"", making ""wall is you"".

Once that's done, walls are passable. Then I can move right past the walls to the key. The key is at 5 right, 3 up. The path would involve moving right from 4 left (Baba's original position) past the walls at 4 right, then to 5 right where the key is.

Alternatively, after changing the rule, I can move directly to the key.

Another approach: instead of changing walls to you, change ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block from the key's rule to the baba's rule. The ""win"" block is at 4 right, 4 up. The baba's rule is at 4 left, 2 down. This would require moving the ""win"" block all the way from 4 right, 4 up to 4 left, 2 down, which is a significant distance, likely blocked by walls. So this might not be feasible unless the walls are passable.

Therefore, the more viable solution is to change the walls to passable by making ""wall is you"", then move through them to the key.

So step-by-step actions:

1. Move left twice from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) to reach the ""rule `you`"" at 2 left, 2 down.
2. Pick up the ""rule `you`"" object and move it to the ""wall is stop"" rule area. Specifically, move it up to 2 left, 3 up, placing it next to the ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 up. This forms ""wall is you"".
3. Now, walls are passable. Move","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which is currently the key. But since the key is labeled as win, maybe I need to get to the key to win.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There are walls blocking the path. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them unless I change a rule. Also, Baba is you, so I can move like Baba. 

The problem is moving past the walls. The walls are arranged vertically to the right. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass them. The rules are scattered around. For example, there's a rule ""wall is stop"" at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can change that rule, maybe walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks that make up the rule.

The rule ""wall is stop"" has three parts: ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". They should be connected to form the rule. If I can move one of these parts, I can break the rule. But I have to make sure I can move them. The objects that are stop can't be moved, right? Wait, the rule says wall is stop, so any object labeled wall is stop. But the text blocks themselves—are they considered stop? Probably not, because the rule is about the wall object being stop. So maybe I can move the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" to create a new rule.

Looking at the current rules, there's also ""key is win"", ""baba is you"", and the wall rule. To reach the key, I need to either go around the walls or make the walls passable. If I can change the wall's property from stop to something else, like push or maybe even you, then I could move through them. 

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. The ""is"" part is at 3 step up, and the ""wall"" part is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So those three need to be connected to form ""wall is stop"". If I can move the ""stop"" text block somewhere else, perhaps I can create a new rule that makes wall something else. For example, if I make ""wall is you"", then I could turn into a wall and walk through it. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the key into a win by moving the text blocks. But the active rule is already ""key is win"". Wait, but the key is an object, so maybe the rule is fixed. Or can I move the ""win"" text block to attach to a different object? Like, if I move ""win"" to Baba, then Baba would be win. That could be a solution. Let's see.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. The ""key"" is at 5 steps right and 3 step up. If I could move the ""win"" text block next to Baba, then the rule would be ""baba is win"", making Baba the win object. Then, I just need to reach Baba (which is me) to win. But how to move the ""win"" text block?

The ""win"" text block is separate from the other rules. To move it, I might need to navigate to its position. The current position of the ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far from where I am. The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position, which might be near the lower right area given the walls. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right, and several steps up and down. The rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" and ""you"" are there. So maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall. So to move the ""win"" text block, I need to go to its location, which is 9 steps right and 4 up from the original position, but that seems distant. Maybe there's a better way.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 step up. So to get to the key, I need to go up from the current position, but there's a wall blocking the way. If I can make the wall passable, like changing its rule, then I can go through it.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" text block from that rule, perhaps I can make a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". Let's see where the ""stop"" text block is. It's at 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So the original rule is wall (left), is (center), stop (right). If I move the ""stop"" block to the left, connecting it to ""wall"" and ""is"" differently, but I need to form a valid rule.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that says ""stop is nothing"", but I don't have a ""nothing"" text block. Maybe rearrange the existing blocks. For example, take the ""stop"" from the wall rule and attach it to something else. If I make ""stop is key"", but that doesn't make sense. The goal is to remove the stop property from walls.

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to go through the walls but rather go around them. Looking at the map, the walls are vertically aligned to the right. If I can go to the left side, maybe there's a path. The rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I move left from there, perhaps I can find a way around. But how to move left past the walls?

Wait, the player is Baba, and since ""baba is you"", I can move around. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them. But maybe there's a way to move the walls by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make the wall a push object, then I could push them aside. But to do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule consists of three text blocks: wall (left), is (middle), stop (right). To break this rule, I need to move at least one of these blocks. Let's say I move the ""stop"" block to another position. If I take the ""stop"" block and place it next to, say, the ""key"" rule, then maybe create a new rule like ""key is stop"", but that would make the key a stop, which is bad. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block to create a rule like ""stop is win"". That doesn't help. Alternatively, create ""you is stop"", but I have a ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Maybe combining ""you"" with ""stop"" could make me stop, which is bad.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on making the wall a ""you"" object. If I can make wall is you, then I can turn into a wall and walk through other walls. To do that, I need to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's see: the original rule is wall - is - stop. If I can move the ""stop"" to another position and replace it with ""you"", then the rule becomes wall - is - you, making walls you. But how to get the ""you"" text block there.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" block and place it next to the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks, that would work. So the steps would be: move the ""you"" block to the position of the ""stop"" block in the wall rule. That way, the rule becomes ""wall is you"", making walls passable as you.

But to move the ""you"" block, I need to navigate to its location. The ""you"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from the wall. The player (Baba) is at the ""baba"" rule's position, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall. So from there, moving right to reach the ""you"" block would be possible if there's no wall in between. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, so that's blocking the way. So I can't move right directly to the ""you"" block because of the wall.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe another approach. If I can move the ""is"" block from the wall rule, then the rule would break. For example, if I take the ""is"" block and move it somewhere else, then the wall rule would be invalid. But the ""is"" block is at 3 step up. If I move it, say, next to the ""key"" rule, then maybe create a new rule. But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 step up. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 step up. If I could move that wall, perhaps by making it pushable, then I could push it aside. But to make it pushable, I need to change its rule to ""wall is push"". But again, need to rearrange the text blocks.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can take the ""stop"" block and place it next to another object, maybe ""key stop"" or something. Not sure. Alternatively, create a rule that says ""stop is key"", but that doesn't help.

Another angle: since the key is win, maybe I don't need to interact with the walls but find another path. Looking at the map, the walls are to the right. Maybe there's a way to go left around them. The player is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall. If I move left from there, maybe there's a path. But are there walls blocking that? The objects show walls at various positions to the right, but not necessarily to the left. Let's check.

The wall at 4 steps right and various levels up. If I move left from the player's position, maybe I can go around. For example, moving left from the ""baba"" rule's position (1 step left, 2 steps down) would take me to the position 0 steps left and 2 steps down. Is there a wall there? The objects listed don't mention walls to the left of the main cluster, so maybe it's possible to move left.

But how to confirm. The available actions are up, down, left, right, idle. Let's think: if I move left from the player's current position, I might be able to navigate around the walls. But I need to check if there are walls in that direction.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" text block to Baba. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far. To get there, I'd have to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 4 steps right, there are walls at various levels up. So moving right from the player's position (1 step left, 2 steps down) would require passing through those walls, which are stop. Unless I can change their rules.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to focus on rearranging the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can make walls passable by changing them to ""you"", then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to take the ""you"" block and attach it to the wall rule.

The ""you"" block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The player is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So moving right once would get to the ""you"" block, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So I can't move right past that wall unless it's moved.

Wait, the wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down is part of the ""stop"" rule? No, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. The wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down is a separate wall object. So it's a wall that's stop, blocking my path to the ""you"" block.

So I can't move right to get the ""you"" block because of that wall. Hmm. This is a problem. Maybe I need to push that wall aside. But to push it, the wall needs to be pushable, which would require changing its rule to ""wall is push"". But again, I need to rearrange the text blocks.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the wall pushable. For example, take the ""push"" text block (if available) and attach it to wall. But in the current rules, there's no ""push"" rule. The existing rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So the text blocks available are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

If I can create a new rule by combining these. For example, move the ""stop"" block from the wall rule and replace it with ""push"". So the new rule would be ""wall is push"". To do that, I need to disassemble the existing wall rule and create a new one.

The original wall rule is wall (left), is (middle), stop (right). If I move the ""stop"" block to another position and place ""push"" there, but I don't have a ""push"" block. Wait, the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you. So no ""push"" block. Therefore, I can't create a ""wall is push"" rule unless I have the ""push"" text block, which I don't.

This is a challenge. Maybe another approach: since the key is win, perhaps I can reach it by moving up and over the walls. But the walls are vertically aligned. For example, from the player's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up would take me to 1 left, 1 down, then 1 left, up, etc., but there are walls at 1 step right and various up positions.

Alternatively, move to the left past the walls. If there's no wall to the left, maybe I can go around. Let's see. The player is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Moving left from there would be 0 steps left and 2 steps down. Is there a wall there? The objects listed don't mention a wall at that position, so maybe it's possible. If I can move left, then I might find a path around the walls.

But how to confirm. The available actions are limited to up, down, left, right, idle. So maybe the solution is to keep moving left until I can find a way up or down that's not blocked.

Wait, but the key is to the right and up. Going left might not help. Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" text block to the key. The current rule is ""key is win"", so the win is on the key. If I can move the ""win"" block to the key, that's already the case. But maybe there's a different win object elsewhere? The observation shows the key as win.

Alternatively, maybe the level is designed such that reaching the key (which is win) is possible by moving around the walls. But the walls are in the way. To move past them, I need to change their rule.

Another idea: since Baba is you, maybe I can turn into the key by creating a rule ""baba is key"". Then, since the key is win, I would be win. But how to create that rule. The text blocks needed would be ""baba"", ""is"", ""key"". The ""baba"" rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down, ""is"" is at 3 step left and 2 steps down, and ""key"" is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. That's a long distance to move those blocks.

This seems too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""win"" text block to Baba. To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""win"" block is (9 steps right, 4 step up) and move it next to Baba. But that's a long way with walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and it's located at 5 steps right and 3 step up, perhaps I can move there by jumping over the walls. But how? The path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 3 step up. If I could move those walls, maybe by pushing them.

But to push a wall, it needs to be a push object. Since walls are currently stop, I can't push them. Unless I change their rule to push. But again, no ""push"" text block.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" block and replace it with ""push"", then walls would be push. But how? I need to have a ""push"" block, which I don't. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

Another thought: maybe create a rule that says ""stop is key"". Then, the stop property would be key, which doesn't make sense, but maybe the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But I don't know if that works. The rule ""stop is key"" would mean that anything with the stop property is key. But the walls have the stop property, so they would become key objects. If key is win, then walls would be win. Not sure if that helps me move through them.

Alternatively, create a rule ""wall is key"". Then walls would be key, but since key is win, walls would be win. Still not helpful for moving through them.

This is really challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block from the wall rule, breaking it apart. If the wall rule is broken, then walls might no longer be stop. But the rule ""wall is stop"" requires all three parts: wall, is, stop. If any one is missing, the rule is broken. So if I can move the ""is"" block away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how to move the ""is""","

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So my goal is to get the key because key is win. But how do I reach it? The key is to the right and 3 steps up from where the player is currently. Looking at the map, there are walls all around, some marked as stop, which means I can't move through them. The player is probably at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down.

So, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. To get there, I need to move right, but there's a wall blocking the way at 4 steps right, 3 steps up. That wall is a stop, so I can't go through it. Hmm. Maybe I can move the wall rule? Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active. If I can change that rule, maybe I can make the wall not stop. Let's see the objects on the map. There's a ""rule wall"" at 1 step left and 3 steps up. If I can move that rule away, maybe I can delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. 

The current position of the player is near the ""baba is you"" rule. Let me check the positions again. The rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The `is` is at 2 steps down, and `you` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So the player is likely at the position of the ""baba"" rule. To move right, there's a wall at 4 steps right. But maybe I can move the ""rule wall"" by dragging the text blocks. For example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". The ""rule wall"" at 1 step left and 3 steps up is part of that. If I can move the ""stop"" text block away, that rule would break. 

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. So if I can move that ""stop"" text block somewhere else, like attaching it to a different subject, maybe I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. But I need to be able to move the text blocks. Since the player is ""baba"" (because of ""baba is you""), and assuming ""you"" can move unless blocked by stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move into them, but I can move around them if possible. 

Let's think: If I move left from the current position, perhaps I can reach the ""rule you"" text blocks. The ""you"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can grab the ""you"" text block and move it, maybe changing the ""you"" property. But the goal is to get to the key. Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes the key pushable or not a stop. For example, if I can say ""key is not stop"", then I could move through the key. But how? 

Alternatively, use the key itself as a tool. Since key is win, maybe touching the key makes me win, but the problem is getting past the walls. If I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls become passable. To do that, I need to destroy the ""wall is stop"" rule. That rule is made up of ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" text blocks. The ""wall"" part is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, ""is"" is at 3 step up, and ""stop"" is at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can separate these text blocks, the rule is broken. 

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block. Since the player is baba, and can move unless blocked by stop. The walls are stop, so moving towards the ""stop"" block might be possible if there's a path. Let me check the path. From the player's position (1 left, 2 down), moving right would hit a wall. But maybe moving up first. Let's see: moving up from the current position (assumed to be at the baba rule's position) would take me to 1 left and 1 down, but there's a wall there. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe move left further. Wait, the player's position is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the wall at 4 right and 2 down. So the player is at (4-1, 2-2) = (3,0)? Not sure about the coordinate system, but assuming relative positions. 

Alternatively, focus on the ""stop"" text block at 1 step right and 3 steps up. To move that block, I need to navigate to its position. Let's say the player is at position (x, y). The ""stop"" block is 1 step right and 3 steps up from the wall at 4 right and 4 up. Wait, the wall is at 4 steps right and 4 up. The ""key"" rule is 4 right, 4 up. Then ""is"" is 5 right, 4 up, ""win"" is 6 right, 4 up. So the top row has the key, is, win. Then below that, rule wall at 4 left and 3 up, which is 4 steps left from the origin? This is getting confusing. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that to get to the key, which is to the right and up, but blocked by walls. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 up. There's a wall at 4 right and 3 up (stop). To go around, maybe move up past the wall, but the wall is there. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from the wall, then I can pass through. To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" block away, then the rule is broken. 

So the steps would be: move towards the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 3 up. To get there, the player needs to navigate from their current position. Let's assume the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left and 2 down from the wall at 4 right and 2 down. So the player's position is maybe (4-1, 2-2) = (3,0). The ""stop"" block is at 1 right and 3 up from the wall at 4 right and 4 up. So from the player's position (3,0), moving right to 4, then up to 3, but there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up (stop). So to get to the ""stop"" block at 1 right and 3 up (which is relative to the wall at 4 right,4 up?), maybe the coordinates are a bit mixed. This is tricky without a visual. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""stop"" text block. If I can move it to another part of the rule, like attaching it to ""key"" instead of ""wall"", then the rule becomes ""key is stop"", which might block the key, but that's worse. Alternatively, moving it away entirely. To do that, I need to be able to pick up the ""stop"" text block. Since the player is Baba (you), and can move unless stopped by stop. The walls are stop, but the ""stop"" text block itself isn't a wall. So maybe I can move the ""stop"" block. 

So the plan is: move right from the player's position to reach the ""stop"" block. Let's see, the player is at 1 left and 2 down from the wall at 4 right and 2 down. So player's absolute position is maybe (4-1, 2-2) = (3,0). The ""stop"" block is at 1 step right and 3 steps up from the wall at 4 right and 4 up. So from the wall at (4,4), moving 1 right and 3 up would be (5,7). But the player is at (3,0). That's a long way. Maybe there's a closer ""stop"" block. Wait, there's another ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 step up. Looking at the objects list: rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up. So that's the ""stop"" text block's position. 

To reach that ""stop"" block from the player's position, the player needs to move right and up. Let's assume each ""step"" is a grid movement. From (3,0) to (4,3): move right once, up three times. But along the way, are there walls? At 4 right, 3 up there's a wall (stop). So moving right to 4, then up would hit the stop wall. So that's blocked. Hmm. 

Alternative route: move up first. From (3,0) to (3,3), but there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up (stop). Not helpful. Maybe move left to 2,0, then up. But not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. 

What if I create a new rule that makes ""baba"" able to move through stops? Like ""baba is not stop"". To do that, I need to find the ""stop"" property associated with Baba. But the only ""stop"" rule is for walls. So unless I can create a new rule, perhaps by combining text blocks. 

Looking at the available text blocks: there's a ""baba"" rule at 4 left and 2 down, ""is"" at 3 left and 2 down, ""you"" at 2 left and 2 down. Then lower down, ""wall"" rules. So perhaps I can take the ""baba"" text block and combine it with ""is"" and ""not stop"" (but ""not stop"" isn't a text block here). Wait, the available text blocks are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", and the rules made from them. 

Alternatively, since ""key is win"", maybe picking up the key would make me win, but I can't get past the walls. So the key is behind a stop wall. To remove the stop property from the wall, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" text block is separate; if I can move it away, the rule is broken. 

So the steps: navigate to the ""stop"" text block at 1 right, 3 up, pick it up, and move it somewhere else. To do that, the player needs to move right and up. But the path is blocked by the wall at 4 right, 3 up. Unless I can move that wall's position by changing the rule. 

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 4 left, 3 up; ""is"" at 3 left, 3 up; ""stop"" at 1 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""wall"" text block, then the rule changes. For example, if I move the ""wall"" text block to ""key"", then the rule becomes ""key is stop"", which would make the key a stop, blocking it. That's worse. Alternatively, move the ""is"" text block, but that would also break the rule. 

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" text block to a different part. If I move it to ""baba"", then ""baba is stop"", making the player a stop, which would block movement. Not good. 

Hmm. Another approach: if I can make the key pushable or movable. Since ""key is win"", maybe just touching it is enough. But to reach it, need to move through the wall. If I can change the wall's property. 

Wait, maybe create a new rule ""baba can move through stop"". But how? The available text blocks don't have ""can move"", but perhaps ""baba is win"" or something. But ""baba is you"" is already a rule. 

Alternatively, use the ""you"" property. Since the player is you, maybe redefining ""you"" to have a different ability. For example, ""you is push"" or something. But there's no ""push"" text block. 

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the ""wall is stop"" rule by rearranging the text blocks. For example, if I take the ""wall"" text block and move it to another subject, like ""key"", making ""key is stop"", but that blocks the key. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, remove the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the rule is broken. So the plan is: move the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 3 up to another location. Let's see, where can I put it? Maybe attach it to ""key"" making ""key is stop"", but that's bad. Or attach it to nothing, effectively deleting the rule. 

To move the ""stop"" block, the player needs to navigate to its position. From the player's position (assuming it's at the baba rule's location: 4 left and 2 down), moving right and up. But the path is blocked. Alternatively, move left to reach the ""you"" rule. 

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from the baba rule. So if the player is at baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right to 3 left, 2 down (the ""is"" rule), then right again to 2 left, 2 down (the ""you"" rule). Then maybe move up? 

Alternatively, the player needs to move from baba's position (4 left, 2 down) to the ""stop"" block at 1 right, 3 up. The coordinates are confusing without a map, but assuming each step is a grid movement, the player would need to move right and up multiple times, avoiding walls. 

But given the previous failures where the assistant kept choosing ""left"" and getting default to idle, maybe the correct action here is to move in a different direction. For example, moving up repeatedly to reach the ""stop"" block. But the walls are in the way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move the ""key"" rule to a different position so that the key is no longer behind the wall. But the key is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" part to somewhere else, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that allows Baba to move over stops. For example, ""baba is not stop"". To do that, the player would need to find the ""stop"" text block and reattach it. But how? 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe the simplest solution, given the previous pattern of moving left, but that didn't work. Perhaps the correct action now is to move up to reach the key's location, but need to find a path. 

Alternatively, since the key is 4 steps to the right and 4 up, and the ""win"" is 6 steps right and 4 up, maybe the key is in a corridor. If I can move the ""stop"" wall by rearranging the rules, then I can pass through. 

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 3 up. If I can move the ""wall"" text block from there, then the rule changes. For example, moving it to ""key"", making ""key is stop"", which blocks the key. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" text block from ""wall is stop"" to another rule. For example, making ""baba is stop"", which would block the player. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct action here is to move the ""stop"" text block away. Since the player is at the baba rule's position, perhaps moving right and up to reach the ""stop"" block. If the previous actions were left, maybe now try up. 

But the assistant kept getting invalid actions. Maybe the valid actions are directional: up, down, left, right. So the correct format is to choose one of those. Given the previous failures, maybe the intended solution is to move right towards the key, but being blocked by the wall. However, since the player is ""baba is you"", and walls are ""stop"", the player can't move into the wall. So to get past the wall, the rule ""wall is stop"" must be broken. 

The only way to break that rule is to move the ""stop"" text block. So the player needs to navigate to the ""stop"" block's position and move it. Assuming the player is at (3,0) and the ""stop"" block is at (5,7), which is impossible given the map's size. Maybe the coordinates are different. 

Alternatively, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step right and 3 step up from the wall at 4 right and 4 up. So from the wall's position, moving right and up. The player is at 4 left and 2 down relative to the wall. This is too vague. 

Perhaps the answer is to move up repeatedly to reach the key's location, even though there's a wall. But since walls are stop, the player can't. 

Wait, another angle: since ""key is win"", touching the key wins the level. So maybe the player doesn't need to go around the wall but can push it or something. But the problem is the wall is stop, so you can't push. 

Alternatively, if the player can change the key's property. For example, ""key is not stop"", making it passable. To do that, create a new rule ""key is not stop"". But there's no ""not stop"" text block. However, maybe using the existing blocks. 

The available text blocks are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"". To make ""key is not stop"", you need the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and something that means ""not stop"". But there's no such block. So maybe it's not possible. 

Alternatively, redefine ""stop"" to mean something else. If ""stop"" is changed to another property, the walls might become passable. For example, if ""stop is push"", then walls can be pushed. But how to do that? 

This is really challenging. Given the","

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the goal is to reach the key because it's defined as win. But I'm controlled by Baba, right? Since ""baba is you,"" I can move around, but walls are stop, meaning I can't move through them.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The walls are forming a path. Let me visualize the layout. The player (Baba) is probably at the position where the rules ""baba"" is located, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the key's position. Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 3 up, so the baba rule is at 1 left, 2 down from there. So Baba's position would be (5-1, 3-2) = 4 steps right and 1 step up? Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact positions.

The walls are forming barriers. Let's see: there are walls at each step to the right, up, down, etc. The key is at 5 right, 3 up. The path might be blocked by walls, so I need to find a way around. The current rules say key is win, so touching the key should win the level. But how to get there?

Looking at the movement options. If I'm positioned near the key, maybe I need to move left or up. But the walls are stopping me. Wait, the walls are to the right, so perhaps I need to go around them. Let me see the exact positions again.

Objects on the map:

- The key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up.
- There's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps up, which is one step left of the key.
- The rule ""you"" is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the key's position. So that's (5+1, 3-2) = 6 right, 1 up. But I'm Baba, so maybe my position is determined by the ""baba is you"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the key: (5-1, 3-2) = 4 right, 1 up. So I'm at 4 right, 1 up.

So my current position is 4 right, 1 up. The key is at 5 right, 3 up. The wall at 4 right, 3 up is blocking the direct path up. So I need to go around. Let's check the other directions.

To the right of me (4 right, 1 up) is a wall at 4 right, 2 up. So I can't go right. Left is possible? But left from 4 right would be 3 right, which might be another wall. Let's see the walls listed: there's a wall at 4 right and 1 step up, which is my current position's up? Wait, no. The walls listed are:

- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up (probably above the starting area)
- Then several walls at 4 steps right and various positions: 3 step up, 2 step up, 1 step up, 1 step down, etc.

So from my position at 4 right, 1 up, moving up would take me to 4 right, 2 up, which is a wall. Moving right would be 5 right, 1 up, which might be clear. Let me check the objects. The key is at 5 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 5 right, 3 up is the key's position? No, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, the key is separate from the walls. The walls at 4 right, 3 up is one step left of the key. So moving right from my position (4 right, 1 up) to 5 right, 1 up. Is there a wall there? Looking at the list, the walls at 4 steps right and 2 step up, 1 step up, etc. So 5 right, 1 up might be clear.

If I move right once, I get to 5 right, 1 up. Then I can move up to 5 right, 2 up, then up again to 5 right, 3 up, which is the key. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up (one left of the key). So moving right to 5 right, 1 up, then up two steps would reach the key. But need to check if there are walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. Let me check the objects again. The rule ""you"" is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the key, which would be 6 right, 1 up. That's probably not useful. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 2 down from the key, which is 4 right, 1 up, which matches my current position.

So the plan is: move right to 5 right, 1 up (since there's no wall there), then up to 5 right, 2 up, then up to 5 right, 3 up (key). But need to confirm if those steps are blocked.

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up (one left of the key)
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up (below that)
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up (my current position's up is 4 right, 2 step up? Wait, my position is 4 right, 1 up. So moving up from there would be 4 right, 2 up, which is a wall. Oh! That's a problem. So I can't move up directly from my position because there's a wall at 4 right, 2 up.

So moving right to 5 right, 1 up is possible. From there, moving up to 5 right, 2 up (no wall mentioned there), then up to 5 right, 3 up (key). But need to check if there's a wall at 5 right, 2 up. Looking at the objects, the walls are listed at 4 right positions mostly. There's a wall at 4 right, 2 step up, but not at 5 right. So moving right to 5 right, 1 up, then up twice should reach the key.

So the sequence would be: right, up, up. But since the key is win, touching it would win. So moving right first to 5 right, 1 up. Then up to 5 right, 2 up. Then up to 5 right, 3 up (key). That should work.

But wait, the active rules are key is win, so as long as I reach the key, I win. So the action needed is to move right once to get to 5 right, 1 up. Then up twice. But the question is, what is the first action needed? Since the previous actions were left, but maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or something, but the current rules are key is win. However, the player is Baba, so if they can touch the key (since key is win), that's the goal. So the direct path is moving right, up, up.

But considering the walls, the initial move right from 4 right, 1 up to 5 right, 1 up is possible. Then up to 5 right, 2 up (no wall), then up to 5 right, 3 up (key). So the first action should be right.

Let me try to figure this out. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach a win object, which is the key in this case. Since I'm Baba, because ""baba is you"" makes me a player.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall directly to the right and up from where I am. The walls are stop, so I can't move through them. So how do I get past the wall?

The rules are text blocks, so maybe I need to move them to change the rules. The ""key is win"" rule is up there with the key. If I can move that rule somewhere else or change it, maybe I can make the wall not a stop or make myself able to pass through.

Looking at the other text blocks: there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up. If I can replace that with something else, maybe the wall isn't stop anymore. Or maybe create a new rule like ""baba is stop"" to avoid the walls, but that might not help since I need to reach the key.

Wait, the key is the win object. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule to be under ""baba is [something]"", maybe I can make Baba the win. Then I just need to get to where the key is, but since I'm already Baba, maybe that would work. Let me check the positions.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 4 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 down. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to ""baba"", forming ""baba is win"", then I would be the win object. Then, even if there are walls, maybe I can walk through them since I'm the win. Wait, but the rules say ""wall is stop"", so unless I change that, walls would still block me.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall not a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how do I move the text blocks? I need to move them step by step, and I can only move objects that aren't defined as stop. Since I'm Baba (you), and assuming none of the text blocks are attached to me, maybe I can pick up the ""is"" or ""stop"" rules.

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The text blocks on the map include the parts of these rules. For example, ""rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" is the ""key"" part of the ""key is win"" rule. The ""is"" and ""win"" are next to it. So to change a rule, I need to move these text blocks to form a new rule.

Looking at the objects: there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"" near the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `you`"". If I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" next to ""baba"", that would make ""baba is you"", which is already the case. But maybe I need to create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""win"" from the ""key is win"" rule and pair it with ""baba"", making ""baba is win"", then I would be the win object. That way, reaching the key (which is win) would mean I win by just being there.

But how to do that? The ""win"" text block is at 8 steps right and 4 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 down. So I need to move the ""win"" block down and right to reach the ""baba"" and ""is"" blocks. However, moving those blocks might require avoiding the walls. The path might be blocked by walls, but since I'm Baba, and walls are stop, I can't move through them. So maybe I need to find a way around the walls by moving the text blocks adjacent to me.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the existing rules. Since the key is win, if I can get to the key, I win. But the key is behind a wall. So perhaps I need to change the rule so that the wall isn't stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 up. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't block me. But moving that rule would require moving the text blocks ""stop"" which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up"", ""rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up"", and ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"". So to change ""wall is stop"" to something else, I need to move these parts. For example, if I move the ""stop"" part to a different subject, like making ""baba is stop"", then walls would still be stop, but I would be stop too, preventing me from moving. That's bad.

Alternatively, maybe delete the ""stop"" rule. But how? If I can move the ""stop"" text block off the grid, but the game probably requires rules to be in triplets (subject, is, property). So deleting one part would invalidate the rule.

Another approach: since I'm Baba (you), and the key is win, maybe I can push the key towards me by moving adjacent objects. But the key is at 4 steps right and 3 up. The walls are directly in the path. Maybe if I can move the wall blocks out of the way by rearranging the text rules.

Wait, the walls are placed on the map as separate objects. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"". These are physical walls that block movement, but their positions are separate from the text rules. So maybe I can move the text rules to change the properties, while navigating around the physical walls.

But how to get past the physical walls? Since they are stop, I can't. Unless I change the rule that makes them stop. So the key is to either remove the ""wall is stop"" rule or change it to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", allowing me to move through them.

To remove ""wall is stop"", I need to rearrange the text blocks. The current ""wall is stop"" is made of three parts: the wall rule, the is, and the stop. If I can move one of these parts, the rule would be broken. For example, if I move the ""stop"" part to another location, then the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer active. Then walls wouldn't be stop, and I could move through them.

The ""stop"" text block is at 2 steps to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that to a different position, say next to ""baba"" and ""is"", forming ""baba is stop"", then I would be stop, which is bad. Alternatively, move it to create a new rule like ""key is stop"", but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move it away so the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's check where the ""stop"" block is located. According to the observation, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 steps to the left and 3 step up. So if I, as Baba, am positioned somewhere nearby, I can move towards it. But where is Baba located?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So my position is at that location. Let me parse the positions:

- rule `baba` is 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the reference point (probably the top-left corner or the player's starting position). Wait, the positions are described relative to the player's current position? Or are they absolute? The problem says ""Objects on the map"" with relative positions. The player (Baba) is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I need to move the ""stop"" block at 2 left and 3 up, that's diagonally up and left from me.

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is at the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is 4 left and 2 down. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left and 3 up. The difference is 2 steps left and 1 step up. So from my position, I need to move up and left to reach the ""stop"" block.

But the path might be blocked. Let's see: moving up from my position (4 left, 2 down) would go to 4 left, 1 down, then 4 left, 0 down (which is same as 4 left), then 4 left, 1 up, etc. But the walls are at various positions. For example, there's a wall 1 step to the right and 4 up, which is probably not on my current path. The walls that are closer are at 3 steps right and 3 up, which is to the right of my current position. So moving left and up might be possible if there are no walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block next to the ""stop"" block to form a new rule. But I'm not sure. The goal is to get the ""stop"" rule removed so walls aren't blocking.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba able to pass through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba is move"". But how to create that? I need to find the ""not"" or ""move"" text blocks. But looking at the current objects, I don't see any ""not"" or ""move"" rules. They only have key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

So maybe the only way is to delete the ""stop"" part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" text block away, then the rule is broken. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left and 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is 4 left and 2 down. The ""stop"" is 2 left and 3 up. The direction from me to the ""stop"" is up and left. So I need to move left and up step by step.

But first, I need to check if the path is clear. From my position (4L, 2D), moving left would take me to 3L, 2D. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects: walls are at 3 steps right and various positions, but to the left of me, there are walls at 4L, 4U; 3L,3U; etc. Wait, the walls are positioned as separate objects. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" would be to the right of the reference point. But my position is at 4L, 2D. So moving left from there would be going towards negative steps left, which may or may not have walls.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""stop"" block first. If I can get to the ""stop"" block at 2L, 3U, then I can move it. But how to get there?

Let's break down the movement needed. From my position (4L, 2D) to reach the ""stop"" block at (2L, 3U), I need to move 2 steps left and 1 step up. But each move is one step at a time. So first, move left twice, then up once. But need to check if those steps are possible.

When moving left from 4L to 3L, is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up, which is probably not in my path. The walls that are closer are at 3 steps right and 3 up, which is to the right of my current position. So moving left should be clear. Similarly, moving up from 2D to 1D, then to 0D (which is the same as 2U?), but need to check for walls.

Assuming there are no walls in the way, I can move left twice and up once to reach the ""stop"" block. Once there, I can move the ""stop"" block to a different location, say next to a ""baba"" and ""is"" to form a new rule, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, move it off the grid to invalid the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe instead of removing ""wall is stop"", I can create a new rule that makes walls something else. For example, make walls ""baba"", allowing me to push them or move through. But I don't have a ""baba"" text block nearby except the existing rule. Hmm.

Another idea: since the key is win, and I'm Baba (you), maybe I can move the ""win"" part of the ""key is win"" rule to be under ""baba"". So if I can form ""baba is win"", then reaching the key (which is win) would automatically make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block from its current position (8R,4U) to be next to ""baba"" (4L,2D) and ""is"" (1L,2D).

The ""win"" block is at 8R,4U. My position is 4L,2D. The distance is quite far. Moving from 4L,2D to 8R,4U would require moving right 8 steps and up 4 steps, which is impractical due to walls blocking the path. Plus, the ""win"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, so moving it would break that rule, but maybe I can re-form it under ""baba"".

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's think differently. The key is at 4R,3U. To get there, I need to go right four times and up three times, but there's a wall at 3R,3U. So I can't go straight right and up. Maybe I need to rearrange the text rules to change the win condition or the stop property.

Wait, the key is win, so if I can reach the key, I win. But the key is behind a wall. The only way is to change the rule so that the wall isn't stop. If I remove the ""stop"" from ""wall is stop"", then walls are no longer stop, and I can walk through them.

To remove the ""stop"" part, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Its current position is 2L,3U. From my position (4L,2D), I need to move left twice and up once. Let's see:

1. Move left from 4L to 3L. Is there a wall? The walls are at 3R and various positions, but to the left, there's a wall at 4R,4U, which is not in the way. So probably can move left.

2. Move left again to 2L. Check for walls. There's a wall at 2L,3U (the ""stop"" block's position?), but that's where the ""stop"" text is, not a physical wall. Wait, the physical walls are separate objects. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up"" is a physical wall at that position. So moving to 2L,2D (after two left moves) should be okay.

3. Then move up once to 2L,1D. Check for walls. The physical walls around here are at 3R,3U, which is to the right, so probably clear.

4. Now at 2L,1D, the next move is up to 2L,0D (which is same as 2U). Still no walls mentioned in that area.

5. Now at 2L,0D, move up to 2L,1U. Then to 2L,2U. The ""stop"" block is at 2L,3U. So from 2L,2U, move up once to reach the ""stop"" block.

Once there, I can pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else. For example, move it to the right next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to form a new rule, but that might not help. Alternatively, move it far away so the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? Each move action can move the block one step in a direction, but only if I am adjacent to it and it's not defined as stop. Wait, the rules say I can move objects or text that are not defined as stop or similar immovable properties. Since ""baba is you"", and I'm moving the ""stop"" text block, which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. But since I'm not defined as stop, I can move it.

So after reaching the ""stop"" block at 2L,3U, I can move it left, right, up, or down. For example, move it left to 1L,3U. This would break the ""wall is stop"" rule because the ""stop"" part is now separated. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore, allowing me to walk through them.

Once that's done, I can go to the key's position at 4R,3U, pass through the walls (now not stop), and grab the key, which is win. So the steps would be:

1. Move left twice from 4L,2D to 2L,2D.
2. Move up once to 2L,3D.
3. Move up once more to 2L,4D? Wait, no. The ""stop"" block is at 2L,3U. Wait, my current position after moving left twice and up once would be:

Original position: 4L,2D.

Move left to 3L,2D.

Move left to 2L,2D.

Move up to 2L,1D.

Move up to 2L,0D (which is 2U).

Move up to 2L,1U.

Move up to 2L,2U.

Move up to 2L,3U (where ""stop"" is","

The problem is that the path to the key is blocked by walls that are marked as stop. So I can't just walk through them.

Wait, the rules say wall is stop, which means any object named wall can't be moved through. But since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", I can move unless there's a stop rule affecting me. But the walls are stop, so I can't go through them. So how do I get to the key?

Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The key is to the right and up, but surrounded by walls. Let me check the positions again. The key is at (4 right, 3 up), and there's a wall at 3 right, 3 up. So between me and the key is a wall. To get past it, I need to either make the wall not a stop, or make myself able to pass through walls.

Since the active rules are wall is stop, maybe I can change that. The rule blocks for wall is at 2 left and 3 up. So if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule away, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. But to move a rule, I need to move the text blocks that form it. For example, ""wall is stop"" is made of three text blocks: 'wall', 'is', 'stop'. These are currently at positions 2 left 3 up for 'wall', 1 left 3 up for 'is', and 2 right 3 up for 'stop'?

Wait, the observation says rule `wall` is 4 step to the left and 3 step up. Wait, no, let me check again. The objects are listed as:

rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up

So the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: 'wall' at (4 left, 3 up), 'is' at (3 left, 3 up), and 'stop' at (2 left, 3 up). To delete this rule, I need to move at least one of these blocks. But since I'm Baba, and I can move objects that are not stop. Are the text blocks considered stop? The current rules don't say text is stop, only wall is stop. So I can move the text blocks.

So my plan is to move the 'stop' part of the ""wall is stop"" rule away. If I can move the 'stop' text block, then the rule wall is stop would be broken. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to walk through them. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba a stop, but that's counterproductive. Or create a rule like 'baba is stop' to prevent moving, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since key is win, if I can get the key, then maybe I win. But the key is behind walls. If I can make the walls not stop, then I can walk through. So moving the 'stop' text block from the wall rule would help.

The 'stop' text block is at 2 left and 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm currently at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down (rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down), let's see my position. If I'm at 2 left 2 down, and the 'stop' block is at 2 left 3 up, then I need to move up to reach it. But there's a wall at 3 right 3 up, which is blocking my path. Wait, but maybe I can move the 'stop' block first. Wait, no, because to move the 'stop' block, I need to be next to it. My position is 2 left 2 down. The 'stop' block is at 2 left 3 up. The difference is 0 in left/right and +1 up. So I can move up once to get to the same horizontal level as the 'stop' block, but I need to be adjacent vertically. Wait, positions are relative. If I'm 2 left 2 down, and the 'stop' is 2 left 3 up, then the distance is 1 step up. So I can move up once to get to 2 left 3 down, which is still one step below the 'stop' block. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move horizontally first. If I move right, I can get to the same vertical level as the 'stop' block. Let's see: my position is 2 left 2 down. If I move right once, I become 1 left 2 down. Then move up to 1 left 3 down. Still not adjacent to the 'stop' block at 2 left 3 up. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, focus on reaching the key. The key is at 4 right 3 up. To get there, I need to go right four times and up three times, but the path is blocked by walls. If I can remove the wall rule, then I can walk through walls.

So the key steps are:

1. Move the 'stop' text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to break that rule.
2. Then, move through the walls to reach the key.

To do that, I need to reach the 'stop' block at 2 left 3 up. My current position is 2 left 2 down. So I can move up once to get to 2 left 3 down, then right to 3 left 3 down, then up to 3 left 3 up, then right to 2 left 3 up (the position of 'stop'). Wait, but movement is step by step. Let's map it out.

Current position: rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So coordinates might be (x=2 left, y=2 down). To get to the 'stop' block at (2 left, 3 up), I need to move up once to reach y=1 down, then up again to y=0 down, then up to y=+1 up, etc. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is such that 'up' increases the y-coordinate. So moving up from 2 down would take me to 1 down, then 0, then +1 up, etc. So to get from 2 down to 3 up, I need to move up 5 steps total.

But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 3 steps to the right and 3 up, there's a wall. So if I move up towards the 'stop' block, I might hit a wall. Alternatively, maybe I can move around the walls by moving right or left first.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to look for the 'stop' block and move it. The 'stop' block is at 2 left 3 up. To reach it, I need to move from my current position (2 left 2 down) up one step to 2 left 1 down, then up again to 2 left 0 down, then up to 2 left +1 up. But between these steps, are there any walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 3 up. But my path is to the left, so maybe there's no wall in between. Let me check the objects again.

The walls listed are:

wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
and others further down.

So on the left side, from my position, moving up left should be clear. So moving up from 2 left 2 down:

1. Move up to 2 left 1 down.
2. Move up to 2 left 0 down.
3. Move up to 2 left +1 up (which is the position of the 'stop' block).

Once there, I can push the 'stop' block. But to push, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I want to move it. Since the 'stop' block is at 2 left 3 up, and I'm at 2 left 3 up (after moving up), wait, no. If I move up from 2 left 2 down to 2 left 3 up, then I'm adjacent to the 'stop' block. Wait, the 'stop' block is at 2 left 3 up. So if I move up to that position, I can then move the 'stop' block in a direction. For example, move it to the left or right.

So once I'm at 2 left 3 up (same position as the 'stop' block), I can move left or right. Let's say I move left. Then the 'stop' block would move to 1 left 3 up, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. That would make walls no longer stop, allowing me to walk through them.

After moving the 'stop' block, I can then go around the walls to reach the key. Since walls are no longer stop, I can walk through them. The key is at 4 right 3 up. From my new position at 2 left 3 up (after moving the 'stop' block), I need to move right four times and up three times. But there's a wall at 3 right 3 up. However, since walls are no longer stop, I can walk through that wall.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move up from 2 left 2 down to 2 left 3 up (adjacent to 'stop' block).
2. Move left to push 'stop' block to 1 left 3 up, breaking the rule.
3. Now walls are not stop, so move right through walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. But the main goal is to reach the key by either removing the stop rule or making myself able to pass through walls.

Another possibility: Since key is win, maybe I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is at 4 right 3 up, and I'm currently at 2 left 2 down. The path is blocked, but if I can move the key. The key is a separate object; to move it, I need to be able to push it. Since the key isn't defined as stop, I can push it if it's adjacent. But to get to the key, I need to overcome the walls.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes 'baba' a 'win' or 'key'. For example, if I can create ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key"", then I would win just by being Baba. To do that, I need to find the 'win' and 'key' text blocks and combine them with 'baba'.

The 'win' rule is at 8 steps to the right and 4 up, composed of 'key', 'is', 'win'. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left 2 down (the 'baba', 'is', 'you' blocks). So if I can move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is', I can create ""baba is win"".

Let's see the positions:

The 'baba' text block is at 2 left 2 down.
The 'is' text block is at 1 left 2 down.
The 'you' text block is at 0 left 2 down.

The 'win' text block is at 8 right 4 up. That's quite far from my current position. Moving there would take a lot of steps, and there are walls in the way. Plus, the 'win' block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, so moving it would break that rule, making key not win anymore. But maybe it's worth it.

Alternatively, focus on the 'key' text block. The key is at 4 right 3 up. If I can move the 'key' text block next to 'baba' and 'is', creating ""baba is key"", then since key is win, that would make me win. But how?

The 'key' text block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, so moving it would break that rule. So first, I need to move the 'key' block. Let's see where the 'key' block is. It's at 6 steps to the right and 4 up. So that's even further away.

This seems too complex. Maybe the simplest way is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the 'stop' block, then walk through the walls to the key.

So step by step:

1. From current position (2 left 2 down), move up to 2 left 1 down.
2. Move up to 2 left 0 down.
3. Move up to 2 left +1 up (now at same position as 'stop' block).
4. Move left to push 'stop' block to 1 left 3 up.
5. Now walls are not stop. Move right four times to 6 left 3 up (past the wall at 3 right 3 up).
6. Move up three times to reach the key at 4 right 3 up.
7. Grab the key, which is win.

But how to execute this in the allowed actions? The problem is that each action is a single step. So I need to sequence the moves one by one.

The immediate action needed is to move up to reach the 'stop' block. Currently, after previous defaults, where am I? The last observation before the current one had me moving left, but it failed. So perhaps I need to start moving up.

In the latest observation, after previous defaults, the objects are the same. So my current position is still rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down.

So the first step is to move up once to get to 2 left 1 down. Then up again to 2 left 0 down. Then up to 2 left +1 up. But each move has to be a single action.

Given that, the next action should be 'up' to move closer to the 'stop' block.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, to win, I need to get the key because key is win. But walls are stop, so I can't move through them. Also, since baba is you, moving Baba means I control the character.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up from my current position. Wait, but how do I get there? There are walls blocking the path. Let me check the layout again. 

The walls are positioned such that moving directly right or up would hit a wall. The key is at (4 right, 3 up), but there's a wall at (3 right, 3 up) and others blocking the path. Hmm. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. 

The rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. If I can change a rule, maybe I can make the wall not stop. For example, if I can make wall be something else, like key or empty. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. Let's see where the rule components are. 

The rule ""wall is stop"" is made up of the text blocks: rule 'wall' 2 steps left and 2 steps up, rule 'is' 1 step left and 2 steps up, and rule 'stop' 2 steps up. If I can move these text blocks, I can change the rule. But wait, can I move them? The rules say that only objects not defined as STOP or similar immovable properties can be moved. The current rule is wall is stop, so walls are immovable. But the text blocks that make up the rules—are they considered walls? Because the rule 'wall' is part of the wall's property. This is a bit confusing. 

Assuming that the text blocks themselves are not walls unless defined as such. The rule 'wall' is part of the rule ""wall is stop"", but the actual wall objects are separate. So maybe the text blocks can be moved because they're not labeled as stop. Let me check the active rules again. The 'stop' property is applied to wall objects, not the text blocks. So the text blocks that form the rules can be moved, which is essential to change the rules. 

So, the plan is to move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall is stop' rule, effectively changing the rule. For example, if I can make 'wall' IS something else instead of 'stop', then the walls wouldn't block me. Alternatively, maybe I can change 'key is win' to make the key not required, or make Baba a win. 

Looking at the current rules, key is win, so getting the key would make me win. But the path is blocked. Alternatively, if I can make 'baba is win', then just reaching Baba (myself) would be the win condition. Let's see where the 'baba' rule is. There's a rule 'baba' 4 steps left and 2 steps down, with 'is' and 'you' next to it. The current rule is 'baba is you', so changing that to 'baba is win' would make me win just by being Baba. 

To do that, I need to move the text blocks 'baba', 'is', and 'you' to form 'baba is win'. The 'win' text block is 8 steps right and 4 steps up. But that's far away. Alternatively, is there a 'win' text block nearby? Let me check the objects again. The active rules include 'key is win', so the 'win' property is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. But maybe I can use the existing 'win' rule to create a new rule. 

Wait, the rule blocks are scattered. The 'you' rule is at 2 steps down, near the bottom. The 'win' rule is way up top. To form 'baba is win', I need to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks together. Let's see their positions:

- rule 'baba' is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down.
- rule 'is' is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.
- rule 'you' is 2 steps down.

The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe it's easier to use the existing 'key is win' rule and find another way. Alternatively, maybe push the 'win' text block down to where the 'baba' rule is. But moving the 'win' block would require it to not be stopped. Wait, the 'win' block is part of the active rule 'key is win', but the text blocks themselves aren't stopped unless they're part of a wall. Since 'win' isn't defined as stop, I can move it. 

So, the steps could be:

1. Move the 'win' text block down to the area where 'baba', 'is', and 'you' are.
2. Rearrange them to form 'baba is win', making the win condition be reaching Baba (myself).

But how to do that? Let's see the positions:

Current 'win' is at 8 right, 4 up. Need to get it to around 2 left, 2 down. That's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, change the 'key is win' to 'win is key', but that doesn't help. Or change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is key', making walls passable. 

If I can make walls passable, then I can go through them. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block out of the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is formed by:

- rule 'wall' at 2 left, 3 up
- rule 'is' at 1 left, 3 up
- rule 'stop' at 3 up

So, to change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is [something else]', I need to replace 'stop' with another property. For example, moving the 'stop' block away and placing a different block there. But where is the 'stop' block located? It's at 3 steps up, but I'm not sure of the exact position. Wait, the objects list has rule 'stop' 3 step up. So the 'stop' text block is 3 steps up from somewhere. 

If I can move the 'stop' text block, then the rule 'wall is stop' becomes 'wall is [empty]', which might not be a valid rule, effectively removing it. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Let's check if the 'stop' block is movable. Since it's not part of a wall's property (walls are stop because of the rule), and the 'stop' text block itself isn't defined as stop, it should be movable. 

So the plan is:

1. Move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall is stop' rule.
2. Then, the rule 'wall is stop' is broken, so walls are no longer stop. I can then walk through them.

Once walls are passable, I can go around them to reach the key or find another way to win. Alternatively, after making walls passable, I can go straight to the key at 4 right, 3 up, since there are walls there, but if they're no longer stop, I can move through them. 

Alternatively, after making walls passable, I can go to the key and pick it up, since key is win. But the key is at 4 right, 3 up, which is behind a wall. If walls are passable, I can walk through them. 

So, first step is to move the 'stop' block. Let's see where the 'stop' block is positioned. From the objects list: rule 'stop' 3 step up. Looking at the map, the 'stop' block is somewhere above. The 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the blocks at 2 left, 3 up (wall), 1 left, 3 up (is), and 3 up (stop). So the 'stop' block is 3 steps up from the player's current position? Or relative to where? This is a bit unclear. 

Assuming the player is at the origin, then the 'stop' block is 3 steps up. To move it, I need to navigate to that position and push it. But movement is step by step. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'stop' block is part of the upper rules. Let's see the initial setup. In previous observations, the 'stop' block was moving left each time I moved left. It seems like the level is shifting or the player is moving, causing the rules to shift accordingly. 

In the latest observation, the 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. The player (Baba) is at rule 'baba' 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player's position is likely at the location of the 'baba' text block. 

To move the 'stop' block, I need to go to its position and push it. The 'stop' block is 3 steps up from the player's current position. So moving up three steps, then possibly left or right to adjust its position. 

Once the 'stop' block is moved, the 'wall is stop' rule is broken, removing the stop property from walls. Then, I can move through walls to get to the key. 

Alternatively, after removing the 'stop' property from walls, I can go around other obstacles. 

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move up three times to reach the 'stop' block.
2. Move left or right to reposition the 'stop' block away from the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Once the rule is broken, move through walls to reach the key.

But how to execute this step by step? Let's see the current observation:

The active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, baba is you.

Objects on the map include the 'stop' rule at 3 step up. The player (Baba) is at rule 'baba' 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player's position is likely at (2 left, 2 down), and the 'stop' block is 3 steps up from there. 

To get to the 'stop' block, I need to move up three times. Then, from there, move left or right to move the 'stop' block away. For example, moving up to reach the 'stop' block, then left to place it elsewhere, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then, head towards the key at 4 right, 3 up. But the path might still have walls, but since they're passable now, I can navigate around them.

Alternatively, after removing the 'stop' rule, maybe I can create a new rule like 'baba is win' to win immediately. To do that, I need to gather the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks. The 'baba' and 'is' are nearby, at 2 left and 2 down, and the 'win' is at 8 right and 4 up. That's a long distance, but maybe possible by moving the 'win' block down.

But moving the 'win' block would require it to be movable. Since it's part of the 'key is win' rule, but the text blocks aren't stopped unless they're part of a wall. So 'win' should be movable. Let's see:

The 'win' block is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. That's quite far from the player's current position. To move it down, the player would need to move towards it, but each move is one step. This could take many steps, but perhaps it's feasible.

Alternatively, focus on making walls passable first, then proceed to the key. 

So, step-by-step:

1. Move up three times to reach the 'stop' block at 3 step up.
2. Move left or right to reposition the 'stop' block. For example, move left once to push the 'stop' block to the left, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop. Move right towards the key, passing through walls if needed.
4. Once at the key's position, pick it up (but in Baba Is You, you just need to be on the key if key is win).
5. Since key is win, standing on the key should make you win.

But in the current observation, the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. Let's check if that's passable now. If walls are no longer stop, then yes. 

Alternatively, after removing the 'stop' rule, maybe the key is now accessible. 

Another approach: Since key is win, maybe instead of moving the 'stop' block, I can create a new rule that makes key not require being a win, but instead makes Baba the win. For example, 'baba is win'. 

To do that, I need to gather 'baba', 'is', and 'win' blocks. The 'baba' and 'is' are nearby, but 'win' is far away. 

Alternatively, use the existing 'win' block from the 'key is win' rule. If I can move that 'win' block to the 'baba' rule's location, then form 'baba is win'. 

The 'win' block is at 8 right, 4 up. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 2 down. That's a big distance, but maybe possible by moving right and down repeatedly. 

Each time the player moves, the entire level shifts, so the positions of the text blocks change. This might require careful planning. 

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'stop' block first. Let's try that. 

In the current observation, the 'stop' block is at 3 step up. The player's position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 2 step left and 2 step down. So moving up three steps from there would reach the 'stop' block. 

Action sequence:

1. up (to 1 step up)
2. up (to 2 steps up)
3. up (to 3 steps up) – now at the 'stop' block's position.
4. Then, move left or right to move the 'stop' block away. For example, move left to place it at 2 steps up and 1 step left, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop. 

Then, move right towards the key. The key is at 4 right, 3 up. From the player's new position (after moving up three times and left once), need to navigate right and down. 

But this might take several steps. Alternatively, after removing the 'stop' rule, move directly to the key. 

Another thing to consider: when you move a text block, you have to push it, similar to pushing boxes in puzzle games. So to move the 'stop' block left, you need to be adjacent to it and move in the desired direction. 

Assuming the player is at the 'stop' block's position (3 up), then moving left would push the 'stop' block left, changing the rule. 

Once that's done, the walls are no longer stop, so the player can move through them. 

Then, the path to the key is clear (since walls are passable), and the player can go right four times and up three times to reach the key. 

Since key is win, standing on it would make the player win. 

So the chosen action would be to move up three times to reach the 'stop' block, then move left to relocate it. However, the system requires a single action per response. 

Wait, each time the assistant responds, it can only give one action. The user provided multiple failed attempts, so the assistant needs to figure out the correct single action based on the current observation. 

Looking at the latest observation provided:

Current Observation:
Active rules:
key is win
wall is stop
baba is you

Objects on the map:
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
rule `stop` 2 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
key 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
wall 3 steps to the right
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `you` 3 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down

In this observation, the 'stop' rule is at 2 step up. The player (Baba) is at the 'baba' rule, which is 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So the player's position is likely at (2 left, 3 down). 

The 'stop' block is 2 steps up from the player's position. So to reach it, the player needs to move up two steps. 

From the current position (2 left, 3 down), moving up two steps would place the player at 2 left, 1 down. Is the 'stop' block there? According to the objects list, rule 'stop' is 2 step up. So yes, moving up two steps would reach the 'stop' block. 

Once there, the player can move left or right to push the 'stop' block away. For example, moving left would push the 'stop' block to the left, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule. 

So the correct action here is to move up twice to reach the 'stop' block, then move left to relocate it. But since only one action can be taken, the immediate action is to move up. 

Wait, the latest observation shows that after previous actions, the 'stop' block is now at 2 step up. So the player needs to move up twice to get to it. But the assistant's previous action was 'up', leading to this observation. Now, in the current observation, the player has moved up, and the 'stop' block is at 2 step up. 

Wait, looking at the history, after the","

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the key or something defined as win, but here key is win, so getting the key would mean winning.

Looking at the objects, I'm Baba because baba is you. The key is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up from where I am. There are walls everywhere that are stop, so I can't move through them. The problem is figuring out how to reach the key without hitting a wall.

The walls are arranged in a grid to the right and up. Maybe I need to move left to get around the walls? Wait, but moving left from my current position might lead me into another wall. Let me check the map again.

The key is at (right 4, up 2). The walls are at various positions, but the main obstacle is the wall directly above and to the right. To get to the key, I need to go right twice and up twice. But the wall at (right 3, up 3) might be blocking. Wait, maybe there's a path by moving around the walls.

Alternatively, since the key is considered a win, maybe I can manipulate the rules. If I can change 'key is win' to something else, but how? To do that, I need to move the 'key', 'is', and 'win' text blocks. But the rules might be in a position that's blocked by stop walls.

Wait, the 'key' rule is 6 steps right and 3 steps up. The 'is' is next to it, and 'win' follows. If I can move these text blocks, maybe I can create a new rule. But the area where they are might be blocked by walls. Let me check the positions.

The key is at (6R, 3U), 'is' at (7R, 3U), 'win' at (8R, 3U). To move them, I would have to go there, but there's a wall at (3R, 3U) and others blocking the path. Hmm. Maybe moving left from my current position (I assume I'm at 3R, but not sure exactly where I am). Wait, the objects list includes rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe I'm at the position relative to the baba rule.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. Baba's rule is at 2 left and 3 down. So if I'm at position (0,0), then the baba rule is at (-2, -3). The walls are at various positions relative to that. The key is at 6R, 3U from Baba's position. So moving right 6 and up 3 from Baba's location.

But there are walls in the way. For example, wall at 3R, 3U. So to reach the key, I need to go around that wall. Maybe moving left first to get around, then right and up. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe I can just go to it despite the walls. But walls are stop, which means I can't move through them. So I have to find a path that avoids the stop walls.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3R, 3U; another at 2L, 2U; and several others below. The key is at 4R, 2U. So from Baba's position (2L, 3D), moving right 4 and up 2 would take me to the key. But the path might be clear.

Wait, the key is at 4R, 2U from Baba's position. Let me check the walls along that path. Moving right once: is there a wall at 1R? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3R, 3U. Not directly in the way. Up two steps from the key's position: the key is at 4R, 2U. So moving up from there would hit the wall at 3R, 3U? Maybe not. This is tricky without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right twice, then up twice. Let's see: starting at Baba's position (2L, 3D). Move right once: position (1R, 3D). Is there a wall there? The objects list has walls at 3R, 1 step up, etc. So maybe not. Then right again to 2R, 3D. Still no wall. Then up to 2R, 2U. Is there a wall there? The wall at 2R, 2U is present. So can't go up there. Hmm.

So maybe need to move up first. From Baba's position (2L, 3D), move up once to 2L, 2D. Is there a wall? The wall at 2L, 2U is there. So can't move up. Then move right to 1R, 3D. Then up to 1R, 2D. Then right again to 2R, 2D. Then up to 2R, 1D. Then right to 3R, 1D. But there's a wall at 3R, 1D. So stuck again.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is to change the rules. Since the key is win, if I can create a new rule that makes Baba win, then I can just reach Baba. For example, move the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks together. But how?

The 'baba' rule is at 2L, 3D. The 'is' is next to it at 1L, 3D. The 'you' is at 2D. To create 'baba is win', I need to move these blocks. But the area around them might be blocked by walls. The wall at 2L, 2U is up from the 'baba' rule. Maybe I can move down to reach them?

Wait, the 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe I'm at position (0,0), and the 'baba' rule is at (-2, -2). Then the 'is' is at (-1, -2), and 'you' is at (0, -2). The key is at (6,3). The walls are at various positions, but the main obstacle is the wall at (3,3).

To move the 'baba', 'is', 'win' blocks, I need to get to them. From my current position (assuming I'm Baba at (0,0)), the 'baba' rule is at (-2,-2). So to reach it, I need to move left twice and down twice. But are there walls in the way? The wall at 3R, 1D is there, but that's to the right. The wall at 2L, 3U is up and left. Maybe moving left and down is possible.

Move left once to (-1,0). Then left again to (-2,0). Then down once to (-2,-1). Down again to (-2,-2), which is the 'baba' rule. Now, can I pick it up? The rules say I can move objects unless they're stop. The 'baba' rule is a text block, so I can move it. Then move it to create a new rule. For example, move 'baba' next to 'win' to make 'baba is win', which would make me win.

But the 'win' is at (8,3). So from (-2,-2), I need to move right to reach the 'win' rule. The path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe move the 'you' rule to 'baba' to make 'baba is you', but that's already the case.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the simplest way is to push the key to the win position, but I don't think that's possible. Alternatively, move the 'key is win' rule to somewhere else, but that might not help.

Wait, the key is already the win condition. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked. Maybe I can move the wall rules to remove the stop properties. For example, if I can make 'wall is not stop', then I can go through walls. But how?

To do that, I need to find the 'wall is stop' rule and break it. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2L, 3U. So from my current position, can I reach there? My position is probably at the 'baba' entity, which is at 2L, 3D relative to the map's origin. So to get to the 'wall is stop' rule at 2L, 3U, I need to move up. Let's see:

Current position: assuming at (0,0), 'baba' is at (-2,-2). The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2L (which is (-2)) and 3U (which is +3). So the position is (-2, +3). To get there from (0,0), I need to move left twice and up three times. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3R,3U. But that's on the opposite side. The path left and up from (0,0) would go through (-1,1), (-1,2), (-1,3), (-2,3). Are there walls there? The 'wall is stop' rule is at (-2,3), which is a text block, not a wall object. The wall objects are at specific positions. For example, wall at 3R,3U is (3,3). So moving left and up from (0,0) to (-2,3) should be possible if there are no stop walls in between.

Assuming there are no walls blocking that path, I could move left twice and up three times, pick up the 'wall is stop' rule, and move it somewhere else. But this requires navigating through the map without hitting any stop walls.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can move the 'key' and 'win' text blocks closer together. The 'key' is at (6,3), 'win' at (8,3). If I can move 'key' next to 'win', it might not change anything, but perhaps create a new rule. But I need to reach those text blocks, which are far to the right.

This is really challenging without seeing the actual grid. Given the previous actions where moving left and right didn't work, maybe the correct action is to move up towards the key, avoiding the walls. But the last observation had the key at 4 steps right and 2 steps up, and the path might be clear now.

In the last observation, the key is at 4R,3U (after moving). The walls are at various positions, but perhaps moving right and up is possible. Let me try to think step by step:

1. Current position: Assume I'm at the same position as the 'baba' entity, which is 2L,3D. So relative coordinates, maybe (0,0) is the center, and Baba is at (-2,-3).

2. The key is at 6R,3U from Baba's position, which would be (6,3) in coordinates.

3. The walls are at positions like (3,3), (2,-1), etc. Need to check if the path from (-2,-3) to (6,3) is blocked.

4. Possible path: Move right towards the key, avoiding walls. For example, right, right, up, up. But need to check for walls at each step.

5. If moving right from (-2,-3) to (-1,-3): No wall mentioned there.

6. Then to (0,-3): Also no wall.

7. Then up to (0,-2): No wall.

8. Continue up to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3): Are there walls? The wall at 2L,2U is (-2,2), which is not in the way. The wall at 3R,3U is (3,3), which is further right.

9. So moving up along the left edge might be possible. Then move right past the wall at 3R,3U. Wait, but from (0,3), moving right would go to (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) which is a wall. So can't go past that.

Alternative route: From (0,3), move down to (0,2), then right to (1,2), (2,2), etc. Are there walls at (2,2)? Yes, there's a wall at 2 step up, which would be (0,2) relative to Baba's position. Wait, the wall at 2 step up is at (0,2). So moving to (2,2) would be (0+2, 2) = (2,2), which has a wall.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to change the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move that rule away, then walls become passable. To do that, I need to reach the 'wall is stop' text block at 2L,3U (which is (-2,3) in coordinates). From my current position (-2,-3), moving up to (-2,-2), (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-2,1), (-2,2), (-2,3). Along this path, are there any stop walls?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2L,2U which is (-2,2). So when moving up to (-2,3), there's a wall at (-2,2) which is a stop wall. So I can't move through that. Therefore, I can't reach the 'wall is stop' rule to modify it.

Alternative idea: Since the key is win, maybe I can move the 'key' and 'win' text blocks together. For example, move 'key' next to 'win' to make 'key is win' into a new rule, but that doesn't change anything. Alternatively, create 'baba is win' by moving the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' blocks.

The 'baba' rule is at (-2,-2), 'is' at (-1,-2), 'you' at (0,-2). To make 'baba is win', I need to move 'win' next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' is at (8,3). So from (-2,-2), I need to move right to (8,3), which is a long way, and there are walls blocking the path.

This seems impossible. Maybe the intended solution is to move left past the walls to find a different path. Wait, in the previous steps, the assistant tried moving left multiple times, but the observations kept changing. Maybe the key is being moved, and the assistant needs to follow it.

Alternatively, the key might be pushable. If the key is an object that can be moved (since it's not defined as stop), then pushing it towards me. But the key's position is fixed unless text blocks are rearranged.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to move up towards the key's new position, as observed in the latest observation where the key is at 4R,3U. So the action would be up.

The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get to the key because it's defined as win. But how do I get there? The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. Looking at the objects, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is blocking that path. Since walls are stop, I can't pass through them.

Now, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to bypass the wall. The rules are spread out. There's a rule ""wall is stop"" 1 step up and to the left. If I can move that rule or change it, maybe I can make the wall not a stop. Let me check the objects again. There's a rule `baba` 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down, along with `is` and `you`. Also, there are other rules like ""key is win"" further to the right.

Wait, I am Baba because of the ""baba is you"" rule. So I can move objects that aren't stop. The current walls are stop, but maybe if I can remove the ""stop"" property from the wall, then I can move through it. To do that, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and either delete it or change it. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. How do I get there?

If I move up first, maybe I can reach that rule. Let's see. My current position isn't specified, but looking at the objects, the key is 4 steps right and 1 up. The wall blocking is at 3 steps right and 1 up. To get to the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to go left and up. Let's check the path. From my current position, moving left once gets me to the wall 3 steps right and 1 up, which is blocked. Hmm, maybe I need to go around. Alternatively, perhaps I can push the rule blocks if they aren't stopped.

Wait, the rules themselves are objects. Since ""wall is stop"", can I move the ""wall"" rule or the ""stop"" rule? The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that rule, then I can change the definition of wall. But how? The rule is part of a text block ""wall is stop"". To move it, I need to separate the ""wall"" and ""stop"" parts. But in Baba Is You, you can move individual words by pulling them apart if they're connected. So maybe I can take the ""stop"" part from the ""wall is stop"" rule and replace it with something else, like ""win"".

Alternatively, I can create a new rule that says ""wall is not stop"". But to do that, I need to have the words ""wall"", ""is"", and ""not stop"" available. Let me check the objects again. There's a ""rule `is`"" at various positions. The ""stop"" word is part of the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can detach ""stop"" from ""wall"" and attach it to something else, maybe I can redefine the wall.

But first, I need to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's look at the map layout. The current active objects show that the key is at 4 right, 1 up, blocked by a wall. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 left, 1 up. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the same starting point as previous observations), moving left twice and up once might get me to the ""wall is stop"" rule. But there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up, which is blocking the path if I'm coming from the right. Wait, maybe I'm positioned somewhere else. This is a bit confusing without knowing my exact position, but perhaps the key is to manipulate the rules.

Another approach: Since the key is win, and I'm Baba (you), if I can grab the key, that would win. But the key is blocked by a wall. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move through it. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's focus on that rule. It's located at 2 steps left and 1 step up. To reach it, I might need to move up first, then left. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the objects around that area. There's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 1 step up, and a rule `stop` at 1 step up. So maybe moving up and then left is possible if those rules aren't in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position. Since rules are objects, and if they're not stopped, I can move them. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is itself a stop because the wall is stop. Wait, no—the rule itself isn't a wall; it's a text block. The text block ""wall is stop"" is an object. Since the rule is not explicitly marked as stop, maybe I can move it. But I need to confirm if the rule ""wall is stop"" makes the text block itself stop. I think in Baba Is You, the rules affect the properties of objects, but the text blocks themselves can be moved unless they're part of a stop rule. Since ""wall is stop"" is a rule, the text block ""wall is stop"" isn't necessarily stop unless there's a rule saying so. But I'm not sure. This requires knowing the exact mechanics.

Assuming I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I could relocate it or break it apart. For example, if I can take the ""stop"" part from ""wall is stop"" and make a new rule like ""wall is key"" or something else. But how to do that? I might need to be adjacent to the words in the rule. Let's say the ""wall is stop"" rule is in three parts: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". If I can move ""stop"" away and replace it with another word, like ""win"", then the new rule would be ""wall is win"", making walls act as win, which might let me pass through them or something else.

Alternatively, create a rule ""you is stop"" to make myself stop, which is bad, so that's not helpful. Another idea: make ""baba is win"" so that touching Baba makes me win. But I already am Baba, so if I can make ""baba is win"", then just staying in place would win. But how to create that rule? I need the words ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"". ""Baba"" is in the rule at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. ""Is"" is nearby, and ""win"" is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up, but that's far. Maybe I can move those words.

But this seems complicated. Let's get back to the immediate problem. The key is win, but it's behind a wall. The key is at 4 right, 1 up. There's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. To get past the wall, either remove the wall's stop property or find another way around. Let's focus on changing the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is at 2 left, 1 up. If I can move left and up to that location, I can manipulate the words.

Assuming my current position is such that moving left and up is possible, the next step would be to move towards that rule. For example, if I'm at position (0,0), then moving left 2 and up 1 would get me to the ""wall is stop"" rule. But there might be obstacles. Let's check the objects again. Between where I am and the ""wall is stop"" rule, are there any stop walls? The path left and up from my current position (assuming I'm at 3 right, something) might be clear. For example, if I'm at 3 right, 2 step up, then moving left to 2 right, 2 up, then up to 2 right, 1 up. But there's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 1 step up, which is at 2 right, 1 up. So maybe I can move left to 2 right, 1 up, which has the ""is"" rule. Then, from there, move up further?

This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map, but the key idea is to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule to change it. So the action would be to move towards that rule. The previous attempts had the assistant moving left or up, but maybe the correct action is to move up first to get closer to the rule's location.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position so that the key isn't the win condition anymore. But that doesn't help if the goal is to reach the key. Alternatively, create a rule that says ""baba is win"" so that just being Baba makes you win, but that requires rearranging the words.

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"", then touching Baba (myself) would make me win. To do that, I need to take the ""baba"" word from the existing rule at 2 steps left and 4 steps down, the ""is"" word from somewhere, and the ""win"" word from the ""key is win"" rule at 8 steps right and 4 steps up. But that's a distance away. Alternatively, maybe there's a ""win"" word closer.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up, which is far. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. The ""is"" rules are scattered. So perhaps it's not feasible to create ""baba is win"" right now.

Back to the original problem: key is win, but behind a stop wall. Need to remove the stop property from the wall. To do that, manipulate the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move there, I can take the ""stop"" word and replace it. For example, replace ""stop"" with ""win"", making the rule ""wall is win"", which would make walls act as win, allowing me to walk through them. Alternatively, delete the ""stop"" part, making the rule just ""wall is"", which might not do anything, but that's risky.

Assuming the goal is to reach the key, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is"" would remove the stop property, letting me pass through the wall. To do that, I need to separate the ""stop"" from the ""wall is stop"" rule. So the steps would be: move to the location of the ""wall is stop"" rule, then pull the ""stop"" word away and discard it, or replace it with another word.

The action required would be to move towards that rule. So the best action is to move up and left towards the ""wall is stop"" rule. But which direction exactly? If the rule is 2 steps left and 1 step up from my current position, then the action would be to move left twice and up once. But in the previous observations, the assistant kept getting invalid actions, possibly because the path was blocked or the direction was incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to move left once to get closer. Let me check the latest observation. The current observation shows that the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 step left and 1 step up. The key is at 4 right, 1 up. So assuming my position is somewhere in the middle, perhaps moving left and up is the way to go. But I need to check if there are walls in the way.

In the current observation, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, which is blocking the path to the key. To get to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 left and 1 up, I might need to go around that wall. For example, move up first to avoid the wall, then left. Let's see: if I move up once, I would be at 3 steps right, 2 step up. Then move left to 2 steps right, 2 step up. Then move up again to 2 steps right, 1 step up, where the ""wall is stop"" rule is located. But is that path clear? There's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 1 step up (which is 2 steps right, 1 step up), so maybe I can move there.

Once at the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can interact with the ""stop"" word. By moving the ""stop"" word away, I can change the rule. So the action after reaching there would be to move the ""stop"" word, but the immediate action needed is to get there.

In the latest observation, the active objects include the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 left, 1 up. The assistant's previous actions were left, up, right, etc., but they failed. Maybe the correct direction is up first, then left. 

So the chosen action would be to move up to approach the rule's location.

The goal is to figure out how to get to the key, which is also the win condition since ""key is win"". So normally, I need to reach the key. But the walls are ""stop"", meaning I can't move through them. Let me look at the current observation.

Active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the player is Baba, and the key is the win object. The walls are still stop, so I can't go through them. 

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. Wait, the player (Baba) is probably at the same position as the ""rule you"" which is at 5 steps down. So the player's position is 2 steps left and 5 steps down from the reference point? Or maybe the reference point is where the game starts, but I need to visualize this.

Let me try to map it out. Let's assume the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. The key is at 4 steps to the right on the same horizontal level? Wait, the key is 4 steps to the right. So the player needs to move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. So moving right directly would hit a wall. 

Wait, the walls listed are at 3 steps right, 1 step up; 3 steps right; 3 steps right and 1 down, etc. So the immediate path to the key (4 steps right) is blocked by a wall at 3 steps right. So how can I get past that wall? The rules still say ""wall is stop"", so unless I can change that rule. 

The available text blocks are ""stop"", ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""baba"", ""you"". The player can move these around, but only if they are not stopped. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""wall is stop"" rule must have been broken apart somewhere. Wait, in the latest observation, the active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer active. That's a key point! So the walls are no longer stop. That means I can move through them? Wait, no, the ""wall is stop"" rule defines that walls are stop. If that rule is removed, then walls aren't stop anymore. But how was that rule removed? 

Looking back at the previous observations, the ""wall is stop"" rule was present initially but got moved or deleted. In the current state, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So walls are no longer stop. That's a crucial change. So I can walk through walls now. That means the wall at 3 steps right is just a wall, but I can move past it. 

So the path to the key is 4 steps to the right. But the key is at 4 steps to the right. Wait, the key is 4 steps to the right from where? The player's position is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So moving right 4 steps would take the player to the key's position. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. But since walls are no longer stop, the player can walk through it. So moving right four times should get to the key. 

But wait, let me check the exact positions. The key is at 4 steps to the right. The player is at rule `baba` which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So moving right 4 steps would place the player at 4 steps right from their current position. But between them and the key, there's a wall at 3 steps right. Since walls are not stop, the player can move right past it. So the sequence would be: right, right, right, right. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me confirm the positions again. The key is 4 steps to the right. The player is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. So moving right four times would reach the key. But the wall is at 3 steps right. So the player needs to move right four times, passing through the wall at 3 steps. Since walls are no longer stop, this is possible. 

Therefore, the correct action is to move right four times. But in the game, you can only move one step at a time. So the first action should be right. Then, after each move, the player's position changes. But according to the current observation, after moving right once, the player would be at 1 step left and 5 steps down. Then moving right again to the origin (0 steps left), then right to 1 step right, then right to 2 steps right, then right to 3 steps right (wall), then right to 4 steps right (key). But since the wall is not stop, moving right through it is allowed. 

Therefore, the immediate action is to move right. Then continue right until reaching the key. Since the problem asks for the next action based on the current observation, the first step is to move right.

Let's try to figure this out. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to get to the win object, which is the key in this case. But since ""key is win"", touching the key would make me win. However, the wall is defined as ""stop"", so I can't go through walls.

Looking at the objects on the map: 

- There's a rule ""stop"" 1 step to the left and 1 step up. Then a wall at 2 steps right and 1 up. Then the key is at 5 steps right, 1 up, followed by ""is"", ""win"", and ""wall"" rules. The wall rules might be part of the structure. 

The player (Baba) is at 3 steps left and 5 steps down, I think. The ""baba is you"" rule means I can move as Baba. The key is at 5 right, 1 up. To get there, I need to navigate past the walls. 

The path from my current position to the key: 

Looking at the map objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 up, then key at 5 right, 1 up. So between me and the key, there's a wall blocking the direct path. But maybe I can move around it. 

If I move up, maybe I can go around the wall. Let's see: From my position (assuming I'm at the same location as the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 5 steps down), moving up would take me to 3 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 2 right, 5 down, which is to my right. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact positions again. 

Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"". So my position is 3 left, 5 down. The key is at 5 right, 1 up. So to get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up. Wait, the wall at 2 steps right and 1 up is in the way. 

But maybe I can move around the wall. Let's see: From my position (3 left, 5 down), moving right towards the key. Let's check the path. To the right, there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up, but that's higher up. Maybe the walls are arranged in a way that creates a corridor. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first. If I move up from my current position (3 left, 5 down) to 3 left, 4 down. Then check if there's a wall there. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 right, 5 down (which is to my right), but not sure about up. Let's see the objects:

The objects include:

- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up
- etc.

So moving up from my position (3 left,5 down) to 3 left,4 down. Is there a wall there? Not directly mentioned. Then maybe move right. Let's see: If I go right once, to 2 left,5 down. Is there a wall? There's a wall at 2 right,5 down, which is 2 steps to the right from me? Wait, maybe the positions are relative. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize:

Assuming the player (Baba) is at position (0,0). Then ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 5 steps down"" would be at (-3,5). The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 up from some reference. Wait, the rules and walls have positions relative to other objects? Or are they absolute positions on the map?

In Baba Is You, the positions are relative. For example, if there's a ""wall"" to the right of a rule, it's placed to the right of that rule's position. But perhaps in this problem, the positions are given as absolute coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe the positions are described relative to the player's position. For instance, ""wall 3 steps to the right"" means 3 steps to the right of the player. 

But given the data, maybe the best approach is to look for the key's location and find a path to it avoiding walls. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 up from the player's current position (if the positions are relative). 

But the player's position is at the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is 3 steps left and 5 steps down. So if I'm at that position, moving right would decrease the left steps. For example, moving right once would make me 2 steps left,5 down. 

Looking at the walls: There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up from somewhere. Wait, the walls are listed as:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up (from initial observation, but in the current observation, it's different)
Wait, in the current observation, the walls are:

- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

So, from the player's position (3 left,5 down):

- Moving up 1 step: to 3 left,4 down. Is there a wall there? No, the walls at 1 step up are 1 left and 1 up from the stop rule, which is probably not in the player's path.

- Moving right: to 2 left,5 down. Then check if there's a wall there. The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is in a different direction. Maybe moving right is possible.

Alternatively, the wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is in a different part of the map. Let's see:

The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is probably located 2 steps to the right and 1 step up from the player's position. So from (3 left,5 down), moving right 2 steps would be 1 left,5 down. Then up 1 step: 1 left,4 down. Is there a wall there? The wall is at 2 right and 1 up, which would be from where? Maybe it's 2 steps right from the player's position, but that's 1 left. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is directly to the right of the player's current position. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 up. If the player is at 3 left,5 down, moving right 5 steps would get to 2 left,5 down. Then up 1 step: 2 left,4 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, which would be 1 left,4 down. So that wall is blocking the path up from that spot.

Hmm. So maybe the path is blocked, and I need to find another way. Let's look at the active rules again. ""key is win"" means I need to touch the key to win. ""wall is stop"" means walls block movement. ""baba is you"" means I control Baba.

Maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the walls passable. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you"", then I could move through walls. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule away and create a new rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 1 step up"". If I can move that rule, maybe I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule. But to move a rule, I need to touch it and then move it, provided that the subject (wall) isn't defined as stop. Wait, the rules that make objects immovable are those with ""stop"" or similar properties. So if ""wall is stop"", then I can't move walls or text blocks attached to them. But since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", maybe I can move text blocks unless they're stopped.

Wait, the tips say: ""You can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar immovable properties."" So if a text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, like ""wall is stop"", then I can't move that text block. But other text blocks might be movable.

In the current map, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is probably composed of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" arranged as ""wall IS stop"". So to break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. But if ""wall is stop"" makes them stop, I can't move them.

However, maybe there's another way. If I can create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, if I make ""stop IS push"" or something, but I don't see a ""push"" property here. Alternatively, make ""wall IS YOU"", which would let me move through walls.

But to do that, I need to find the ""stop"" rule and maybe replace it. Let's see the objects:

There's a rule `stop` at 1 left and 1 up. Then the ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left"", ""rule `is` 1 step to the left"", and ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 1 step up"". So the ""wall IS stop"" rule is three text blocks arranged horizontally.

To break this rule, I need to move one of those three text blocks. But since ""wall is stop"", those text blocks are part of a stopped rule, so I can't move them. That's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""stop"" do something else. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" text block to form a new rule like ""stop IS win"", but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can reach the key by moving around the walls. Let's see the path again. From the player's position (3 left,5 down), moving right towards the key at 5 right,1 up.

If I move right four times: to 2 left,5 down; 1 left,5 down; 0 left,5 down; -1 left,5 down (which is 1 right). Then up once: -1 left,4 down. But there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up, which would be from the player's position (3 left,5 down), moving right 2 steps would be 1 left,5 down. Then up 1 step: 1 left,4 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is probably at (3 left -2 steps right,5 down +1 step up) = 1 left,4 down. So yes, that's a wall blocking the path.

Hmm. So moving up there is blocked. What if I go around the wall by moving up first? From the player's position (3 left,5 down), move up to 3 left,4 down. Then right to 2 left,4 down. Then up to 2 left,3 down. Then right to 1 left,3 down. Then right to 0 left,3 down. Then up to 0 left,2 down. Then right to -1 left,2 down (1 right). Then up to -1 left,1 down. Then right to 0 left,1 down. Then up to 0 left,0 down (player's starting position perhaps). This seems too complicated and might not be feasible due to walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is the win condition, and I'm Baba, maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule to make myself win without touching the key. For example, change ""key IS win"" to ""baba IS win"". But to do that, I need to move the text blocks of the ""key is win"" rule.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 steps right,3 step up (from earlier observations). Wait, in the current observation, the ""key is win"" rule is formed by ""rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 1 step up"", ""rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 1 step up"", and ""rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So to change this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. But are they movable? Since ""key is win"" doesn't have a stop property, maybe they can be moved.

If I can move the ""win"" text block to make ""baba IS win"", that would let me win just by being Baba. To do that, I need to grab the ""win"" rule and move it next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""win"" text block from 7 steps right,1 step up to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", that would create ""baba IS win"".

But how to reach that? The ""win"" text block is 5 steps right and 1 step up from the player's position. So moving right 5 times and up once. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, which blocks that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move around the wall. Let's see: From the player's position (3 left,5 down), move up to 3 left,4 down. Then right to 2 left,4 down. Then up to 2 left,3 down. Then right to 1 left,3 down. Then up to 1 left,2 down. Then right to 0 left,2 down. Then up to 0 left,1 down. Then right to -1 left,1 down. Then up to -1 left,0 down. Then right to 0 left,0 down. But this path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the ""win"" text block without going through the key area. The ""win"" is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move horizontally to get there, but the wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is in the way.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again. The key is at 5 right,1 up. The wall blocking the path is at 2 right,1 up. Maybe if I can move that wall's rule. But since ""wall is stop"", the text blocks forming that rule are stopped, so I can't move them.

Another idea: Maybe I can push the wall by moving it. But if the wall is defined as stop, I can't. Unless I change the rule.

Alternatively, use the ""key is win"" to override the wall. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So touching the key makes me win. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them. But maybe I can make a rule that makes walls not stop. For example, change ""wall IS stop"" to ""wall IS push"". But to do that, I need to edit the existing rule.

The existing ""wall IS stop"" rule is made of three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". If I can move one of these, I can break the rule. But since they're part of a stopped rule, I can't move them.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""you"" rule to make Baba win without touching the key. For example, if I can make ""baba IS win"", then just being Baba would make me win. 

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule. So the ""baba IS you"" rule is formed by ""rule `baba` 3 step left"", ""rule `is` 2 step left"", and ""rule `you` 1 step right"". To change this to ""baba IS win"", I need to replace ""you"" with ""win"" in that rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block and place it next to a ""win"" text block. The ""win"" text block is part of the ""key IS win"" rule, located at 7 steps right and 1 step up.

So the plan would be:

1. Move from the current position (3 left,5 down) to the ""you"" rule's location (1 step right, 2 steps down from ""baba"" which is 3 left,5 down). So the ""you"" rule is at 3 left -1 step right = 2 left,5 down +2 steps down = 2 left,7 down. Wait, this might not be correct. The positions are described as relative to the ""baba"" rule. 

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule. So if ""baba"" is at (0,0), then ""you"" is at (1, -2). The ""win"" text block is at (7,1) relative to some point. This is getting too vague without a clear map.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""you"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to form ""baba IS win"". The ""you"" is currently at 1 step right and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule. To get it to the ""is"" rule, which is 1 step left from the ""baba"" rule, I need to move the ""you"" text block up and left.

But how? The ""you"" text block is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down relative to the ""baba"" rule. Wait, in the current observation, the ""you"" rule is at ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"". So from the ""baba"" rule's position (3 left,5 down), moving 1 step right and 2 steps down would be 2 left,7 down. 

The ""is"" rule for the ""baba IS you"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from ""baba"", so 4 left,7 down. The ""you""","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means if I can get to the key, it becomes the win condition. Since I'm Baba, I'm considered ""you"", so moving to the key should let me win.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 3 steps to the right of my current position. But there's a wall blocking the way at 2 steps to the right. The rule ""wall is stop"" means I can't move through walls. So I need to find a way past that wall.

Wait, maybe I can manipulate the rules. There's a ""rule 'stop' 1 step to the left and 1 step up"". If I can move that ""stop"" rule out of the way, maybe the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. Or perhaps I can create a new rule that changes the wall's property. Let me check the available text blocks.

Looking around, there are other rules like ""key is win"", ""baba is you"", and the ""stop"" rule. Also, there's a ""rule 'wall' 3 step to the left"" and ""rule 'is' 2 step to the left"". If I can rearrange these, maybe I can override the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how do I move the text blocks? The user said I can only move objects or text that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So any object that's not a stop can be moved. The ""baba"" rule is there, but since ""baba is you"", which makes me controllable. So maybe I can use that to move the other text blocks.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that rule away, the wall might no longer be considered stop. Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""wall is not stop"" or something. But I need to have the necessary text blocks.

Wait, the key is 3 steps to the right. Let me see the path. From my current position, I need to go right three times. But the first step right is a wall. So I need to remove that wall's stop property. To do that, I might need to move the ""stop"" rule that's affecting it.

Looking at the objects again, there's a ""rule 'stop' 1 step to the left and 1 step up"". If I can move that rule somewhere else, perhaps the wall at 2 steps right (which is in the way) becomes passable. But how?

I can move text blocks that aren't stop. So the ""stop"" rule itself isn't a stop object, right? Wait, the rule ""stop"" is a text block, but the property ""stop"" is what makes objects immovable. So maybe I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it.

If I move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall's stop property would be removed. For example, if the wall is at 2 steps right, and the ""stop"" rule that's affecting it is at 1 left and 1 up, maybe moving that rule to another location would change the wall's behavior.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule that says ""wall is push"" or something, allowing me to move it. But I don't have a ""push"" text block nearby. Let me check the available objects again.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule 'key'"", ""rule 'is'"", ""rule 'win'"", ""rule 'wall'"", and ""rule 'baba'"". Also, the ""you"" rule is present. If I can combine these to form a new rule that changes the wall's property.

For example, if I can create ""wall is you"", then since I'm you, maybe I can move through walls. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" and ""is"" and ""you"" text blocks together to form ""WALL IS YOU"". But that requires picking up those text blocks.

But the problem is, the wall is blocking my path to the key. So I need to get past it first. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule that's applied to the wall. If I can move that rule to another object, the wall might no longer be stop.

The ""stop"" rule is currently at 1 left and 1 up. If I move it to, say, the key's position, then the key would become stop, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, moving the ""stop"" rule away from the wall.

Wait, the wall that's blocking me is at 2 steps right. The ""stop"" rule that's affecting it is perhaps the one at 1 left and 1 up. Maybe that rule is applying to all walls? Or just specific ones. Not sure, but maybe moving that rule elsewhere would help.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe I can reach it by moving around the walls using other means. But the path is straight right, with walls at each step until the key. So unless I can remove the stop property from the walls, I can't get past.

Another approach: since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else. To do that, I need to move the existing ""wall is stop"" rule and replace it. But where is the original ""wall is stop"" rule?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule 'wall' 3 step to the left"" and ""rule 'is' 2 step to the left"". Combining those would make ""WALL IS [something]"". If I can move the ""is"" rule next to a different property, like ""you"" or ""win"", maybe I can change the wall's property.

For example, if I move the ""wall"" rule (3 steps left) and the ""is"" rule (2 steps left) next to the ""you"" rule, that would create ""WALL IS YOU"", making walls passable. But I need to see where those text blocks are located.

The ""wall"" rule is 3 steps to the left, and the ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I can't reach there in one move.

Alternatively, maybe there's an existing ""stop"" rule that I can move. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. If I can move that rule away, perhaps the walls become passable.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. Since I'm Baba (you), and the rule ""baba is you"" is active, I can move text blocks that aren't stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, but it's not marked as stop unless it's part of a rule. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a rule that defines stop property, so maybe moving that rule would change which objects are stop.

If I move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, it might invalidate the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, if the original ""wall is stop"" was formed by a rule at a certain location, moving the ""stop"" part would break that rule.

Alternatively, creating a new rule that says ""wall is not stop"". To do that, I need the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""not stop"" text blocks. But I don't see a ""not"" text block. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use the existing rules. If I can form a new rule by combining ""wall"", ""is"", and another property. For example, if there's a ""push"" rule somewhere, but I don't see that. The available rules seem to be key, is, win, wall, baba, you, and stop.

Another idea: since the key is the win condition, maybe I don't need to avoid the walls. If I can make the key into a win by moving the ""key is win"" rule to myself. But I'm already ""you"", so maybe combining ""baba"" with ""win"" would make me win.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can create a rule ""baba is win"", then since I'm baba and you, I would be win. But how to create that rule.

To create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" rule, ""is"" rule, and ""win"" rule together. The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""win"" rule is 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. That's quite far from my current position.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the existing ""key is win"" rule to apply to baba. If I can move the ""key"" and ""win"" parts away and attach them to ""baba"".

But this seems complicated. Let me think again. The immediate problem is the wall blocking the path to the key. I need to get past it.

If I can move the ""stop"" rule that's making the wall stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. If I move that rule to a different location, perhaps the wall's stop property is removed.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to the key's location, then the key would become stop, which is bad. But if I move it somewhere else, maybe the wall is no longer stop.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. Since I'm you (Baba), I can move text blocks that aren't stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, but it's not a stop object unless it's part of a rule. Wait, the rule ""stop"" defines that stop is a property. So moving the ""stop"" rule would just move the definition, not the property.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is 3 steps right, but the first step is a wall. The rule ""wall is stop"" means I can't move through it. So I need to either remove the wall, make it not stop, or find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall if there's a ""push"" rule. But I don't see a push rule. The available rules are stop, key, is, win, wall, baba, you.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active. If I can create a new rule that says ""wall is push"", then I could push the wall. But to create that, I need the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""push"" text blocks. But there's no ""push"" rule present.

Another angle: since the key is the win condition, maybe I don't need to reach it physically. If I can change the win condition to something I can reach. For example, make ""baba is win"". Then, just by being Baba (you), I win. But how to create that rule.

The existing rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can move the ""win"" rule to apply to ""baba"". So, take the ""win"" text block (which is at 7 steps right and 1 step up) and combine it with ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down. So if I can move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks together, that would create ""BABA IS WIN"", making me win.

But the problem is the distance. The ""win"" is far to the right, while ""baba"" and ""is"" are far to the left. It might take multiple moves to gather them, but maybe in this level it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter way. Let's see the current position. From the latest observation, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects are positioned with the key at 3 steps right, walls blocking the path, and the necessary text blocks to create new rules scattered around.

But given the time constraints and previous failed attempts, maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the key, even though there's a wall. Wait, but the wall is stop, so I can't. Unless I can move the wall by pushing it, which requires a ""push"" rule.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are not all stop. The rule ""wall is stop"" applies to all walls? If there's a way to make a specific wall not stop, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the walls are only stop because of that specific ""stop"" rule. If I can remove that rule, the walls would no longer be stop. But how to remove a rule. In Baba Is You, you can break a rule by separating its components. For example, if the rule is ""WALL IS STOP"", you can move the ""WALL"" or ""STOP"" part away, breaking the rule.

So the current ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. That rule is probably part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" part away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, making walls not stop.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule (which is a text block at 1 left and 1 up) to a different location, thus breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, I can move through the walls to reach the key.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Since I'm Baba (you), and the ""stop"" rule isn't making me stop (unless I'm a wall), but I'm not a wall. So I can move the ""stop"" rule.

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. If I move it down or to the right, it would be removed from its current position, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So the action would be to move the ""stop"" rule. But how to command that. The available actions are idle, up, down, left, right.

Wait, the assistant needs to choose one of the actions: idle, up, down, left, right. But to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which would move the text block with you if it's not stop.

But in the game, when you move towards a text block, if you're not stop, you can pick it up and move it. So the action would involve moving towards the ""stop"" rule, picking it up, and then moving in a direction to place it elsewhere.

But in this case, the user is providing the observation, and the assistant has to output a single action (like up, down, left, right, or idle). The previous attempts had the assistant trying to move left, right, up, but perhaps they weren't adjacent to the necessary text blocks.

In the latest observation, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects include the ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 1 up. The player (Baba) is likely at the position where the ""baba"" rule is located, which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down in the previous observations, but in the latest observation, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down.

Assuming the player's current position is at the location of the ""baba"" entity, which is 2 steps left and 5 steps down, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. So the distance between the player and the ""stop"" rule is 1 step left and 4 steps up. To move the ""stop"" rule, the player needs to move towards it, pick it up, and then move in a direction to place it elsewhere.

But the action the assistant can output is just a single direction (up, down, left, right, or idle). So the assistant needs to determine the direction that allows moving towards the ""stop"" rule.

In the current observation, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 5 steps down. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. So the player needs to move from their position (presumably at the ""baba"" rule's location) to the ""stop"" rule's location.

The direction from 2 left, 5 down to 1 left, 1 up would be up and left. But the available actions are only single directions. So the player would need to move left first to get to 1 left, then move up four steps. But in one action, the assistant can only choose one direction.

Alternatively, maybe the player is adjacent to the ""stop"" rule. If the latest observation shows the ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 1 up from the player's position, then the player could move up once to reach it, pick it up, and then move left or right to place it elsewhere.

But given the previous failed attempts, perhaps the assistant didn't find the correct sequence. Alternatively, maybe the simplest solution is to move towards the key, accepting that the initial move will hit the wall, but if the wall is no longer stop, it would pass through.

Wait, but the rule ""wall is stop"" is still active. Unless the assistant has already moved the ""stop"" rule. If the previous actions didn't do that, then moving right into the wall would be impossible.

Given the history, the assistant tried moving left, right, up, but perhaps wasn't in the right position to move the ""stop"" rule.

In the latest observation, the key is 3 steps to the right. The walls are at each step right up to the key. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. The player (Baba) is likely at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 left and 5 down.

To reach the ""stop"" rule, the player needs to move up and left. For example, move up four times and left once. But in one action, the assistant can only choose one direction. So the first step would be to move up to get closer.

Alternatively, maybe the player is already adjacent to the ""stop"" rule. If the ""stop"" rule is 1 left and 1 up from the player's current position, then moving up once would bring the player next to the ""stop"" rule, allowing them to pick it up and move it.

Assuming that, the correct action would be to move up to reach the ""stop"" rule, then in subsequent moves, move it away. But since the assistant can only output one action per turn, the first action should be to move towards the ""stop"" rule.

Therefore, the chosen action should be up.

The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". Since ""baba is you"", that means I can control Baba. The goal is to get to the key because ""key is win"". But the key is located at 7 steps to the right. There are walls (marked as stop) along the way. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map:

- There's a rule `stop` 1 step to the left. Not sure where that is exactly relative to me.
- A wall is 2 steps to the right. So if I'm at the starting position, moving right twice would hit a wall, which is stop. Can't go through that.
- The key is 5 steps to the right. Wait, no, the key is at 5 steps to the right from where? The observation shows the key is 5 steps to the right from the current position. But there's a wall at 2 steps to the right, then maybe another wall at 3 steps? Let me parse the objects again.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to reach the key. The key is at 5 steps to the right, but there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. So I can't go directly right past the wall. Maybe I need to move around the walls. Let me see the layout:

- Current position: Assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe at (0,0).
- Wall at 2 steps right: So position (2,0).
- Key at 5 steps right: (5,0).
- But there's a wall at 3 steps right? Wait, looking at the objects:

Objects on the map include:
- wall 2 steps to the right
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right
- rule `is` 6 steps to the right
- rule `win` 7 steps to the right
- Then a wall at 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe that's off to the left and down, not in the direct path.

Other walls are at 2 steps right and 1 step down, 2 steps right and 2 steps down, etc. So perhaps the direct path to the key is blocked by the wall at 2 steps right. So I need to find another route.

Since the walls are stop, I can't move into them. Maybe I can move up or down around the walls. Let's see:

The wall at 2 steps right is straight ahead. If I move up or down, can I get around it? Let me check if there's space.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm at (0,0), moving down to (2,-1) is a wall. Similarly, moving up to (2,1) might be a wall? Wait, the objects include:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down: So from current position, (2,-1) is a wall.
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (2,-2)
- Etc. So directly down and right is blocked. What about other directions?

Alternatively, maybe there's a path by moving left first. There's a rule `stop` 1 step to the left. But can I move left? Since ""wall is stop"", but the rule `stop` is a separate thing. Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's no rule that makes left movement blocked except if there's a wall. The rule `stop` is a property, but in the current active rules, ""wall is stop"", so any wall has the stop property. Are there walls to the left?

The objects include a wall at 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. That's probably not in the immediate left path. The closest wall to the left is the rule `stop` 1 step to the left. Wait, the rule `stop` is a text block, not a wall. The objects list includes ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left"". So that's a text block saying ""STOP"", but since ""wall is stop"", any wall has the stop property. However, the rule `stop` itself is just a text block, not an object with the stop property unless it's part of a rule.

Wait, perhaps I need to parse this correctly. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects on the map include various rules and walls. For example, ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left"" is a text block that says ""STOP"", but since ""wall is stop"", maybe there's a wall at that position with the stop property. But I'm not sure. The way the objects are listed might be confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the key is 5 steps to the right, but there's a wall in between. So I need to find a way to bypass the wall. Since walls are stop, I can't push them unless I change the rules. For example, if I can make ""stop"" into something else, or make the wall not a stop. But the current active rules are ""wall is stop"", so unless I change that, walls are immovable.

Wait, the other rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's no rule that allows moving or pushing walls. So to get past the wall at 2 steps right, I might need to move around it by going up or down. Let's check if that's possible.

If I move up from the current position, maybe there's a path. The objects include a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, but not sure about other positions. If I move up one step, then try to go right around the wall. Let's see:

Current position: let's say (0,0).

- Move up to (0,1).
- From there, move right. Is there a wall at (2,1)? The objects list a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, which would be (2,-1). There's no mention of a wall at (2,1). So moving up to (0,1) and then right to (2,1) might be possible if there's no wall there.

Alternatively, moving down. But the wall is at (2,-1), so moving down to (0,-1), then right to (2,-1) is a wall. That's not helpful.

Another approach: since ""key is win"", maybe instead of going to the key directly, I can change the win condition. But the active rule is still ""key is win"", so unless I can create a new rule that says ""baba is win"", then I could reach Baba himself to win. But how?

To create a new rule, I need to move the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"", then ""baba is win"" would be a new rule, making Baba the win condition. That way, I just need to reach Baba (which I am) to win.

So the plan would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps to the left and 6 steps down. From the current position, that's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""baba"" rule.

Wait, looking at the objects:

There's a rule `baba` at 3 steps to the left and 6 steps down. And rule `you` at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So to make ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" rule, ""is"" rule, and ""win"" rule together.

But the current position is somewhere, and the key is 5 steps to the right. Let's try to figure out the current position relative to these objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps to the right. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps to the right, and ""baba"" is at 3 steps to the left and 6 steps down. That's a bit scattered.

This might be complex. Alternatively, since the key is the win object, maybe the intended solution is to reach the key, but the path is blocked. So how to get around the wall at 2 steps right.

Wait, the wall at 2 steps right is in the way. If I can move left past the rule `stop` 1 step to the left, but is that allowed? The rule `stop` is a text block, not an object with the stop property unless it's part of a wall. Since ""wall is stop"", any wall has stop property. The rule `stop` itself is just a text block. So moving left past it should be possible unless there's a wall there.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps to the left and 1 step down, but that's not in the direct left path. The rule `stop` is 1 step to the left. So if I move left once, am I hitting a wall or just a text block?

Since ""wall is stop"", but the rule `stop` is a text block, unless it's part of a wall rule. For example, if there's a wall at 1 step left, then the rule `stop` would be part of that wall's definition. But the objects list a wall at 3 steps to the left and 1 step down, which is different.

So moving left one step would take me to the position of the rule `stop`, which is just a text block, not a wall. Therefore, I can move left past it.

So the path could be: move left to avoid the wall in front, then find another way to reach the key.

But the key is to the right. So moving left doesn't help directly. Maybe there's a way to go around the wall by moving up or down first.

Let me try to outline the possible movements:

Current position (assumed): let's say at (0,0).

- Moving right 2 steps hits a wall.
- Moving left 1 step reaches the rule `stop` (a text block), which is not a wall, so allowed.
- Moving up: what's there? At (0,1), are there walls? The objects list a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, but not at (0,1). So moving up to (0,1), then right to (2,1) might be possible if there's no wall there.

Check if (2,1) is a wall. The objects include a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down (so (2,-1)), but nothing at (2,1). So moving up to (0,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (5,1) to get the key? But the key is at 5 steps to the right from the current position, which is (5,0). If I move up to (0,1), then right to (5,1), that's 5 steps right, but the key is at (5,0). So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, moving up to (0,1), then right to (2,1), then down to (2,0), which is the wall. That's not helpful.

Another option: move down. From (0,0) to (0,-1). Then right to (2,-1), which is a wall. Not good.

So perhaps the best bet is to move left past the rule `stop`, then find another path. But how to reach the key from there.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", making ""baba is win"".

The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps to the right. The ""is"" rule is at 6 steps to the right, and the ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left and 6 steps down. That's quite far. Maybe I need to move horizontally first.

But moving horizontally is blocked by the wall at 2 steps right. Unless I can move around it by going up or down.

Alternatively, if I can push the wall, but since ""wall is stop"", I can't move it unless I change the rule. For example, if I can make ""stop"" into ""push"" or remove the ""stop"" property.

But to do that, I need to modify the existing rules. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". To change ""wall is stop"", I would need to break that rule or replace it. But how?

To break a rule, I need to move the text blocks that form the rule. For example, the rule ""wall is stop"" is made up of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". If I can move these blocks apart, the rule is no longer active.

But the objects list includes ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"", which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Similarly, ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 1 step up"" are parts of that rule.

So to break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move those text blocks away from each other. For example, move the ""wall"" text block to a different position so that it's not next to ""is"" and ""stop"".

Once ""wall is stop"" is broken, walls might no longer be stop, allowing me to move through them. But this requires precise movement.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes ""wall"" something else, like ""push"" or remove the stop property. But that's complicated.

Given the time constraints, maybe the intended solution is to realize that the key is the win object, and since ""baba is you"", you can just move to the key by navigating around the walls.

But how to get past the wall at 2 steps right. Let's think again.

If I move left past the rule `stop`, then maybe there's a path upwards. For example:

1. Move left once to the position of the rule `stop` (1 step left).
2. From there, move up. Let's say moving up to (1,1).
3. Then move right around the wall. Since the wall is at (2,0), moving up to (1,1), then right to (2,1), then right to (5,1) to get the key. But the key is at (5,0), so maybe moving down from (5,1) to (5,0) would get the key.

But does the key allow moving down onto it? Since ""key is win"", stepping on the key would win the game. So if I can reach the key's position, that's the goal.

So the path could be:

- Left to (1,0)
- Up to (1,1)
- Right to (2,1)
- Right to (3,1)
- Right to (4,1)
- Right to (5,1)
- Down to (5,0) to get the key.

But need to check if there are any walls along this path.

Looking at the objects:

- At (2,1): Is there a wall? The objects list a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down (so (2,-1)), but not at (2,1). So (2,1) is clear.
- Similarly, other positions (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) don't have walls mentioned. The walls are further down.

So this path might be possible. Therefore, the sequence of actions would be:

left, up, right, right, right, right, down.

But the agent needs to choose one action at a time. The current observation shows the active rules and objects. The agent's current position is not explicitly stated, but based on the objects, perhaps the agent is at the position relative to the rules.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 6 steps down. That seems far, but perhaps not.

Alternatively, the agent is at the starting position, and the objects are positioned relative to that.

Given the uncertainty in the agent's position, but based on the objects listed, the key is 5 steps to the right. The wall is at 2 steps right. So the agent needs to go around.

Assuming the agent is at (0,0):

1. Move left to (1,0) – allowed.
2. Move up to (1,1) – allowed.
3. Move right to (2,1) – allowed.
4. Move right to (3,1) – allowed.
5. Move right to (4,1) – allowed.
6. Move right to (5,1) – allowed.
7. Move down to (5,0) – key is here, so win.

But the agent needs to choose one action now. The current observation might be after several moves, but the last action was 'up', leading to this new observation.

Looking at the latest observation:

Active rules: key is win, baba is you.

Objects on the map include:

- rule `stop` 1 step to the left
- wall 2 steps to the right
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right
- etc.

The agent's position is unclear, but after moving 'up' previously, maybe the agent is now at a position where moving right is possible.

Alternatively, in the current observation, after moving 'up', the agent is one step up, and needs to decide the next move.

Assuming the agent is one step up from the starting position, facing the wall at 2 steps right. So from (0,1), moving right would be to (2,1), which is clear.

So the best action now would be 'right' to move towards the key.

Let's see. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get to the key because it's defined as win. But wait, usually the win is an object you need to reach, but here the key itself is the win condition. So, I need to move towards the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall 1 step to the right. Also, there's a rule ""stop"" 2 steps to the left. Wait, the rules are part of the game, so ""wall is stop"" was probably a previous rule, but now the active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the walls are still stop? Or does the absence of ""wall is stop"" mean walls are not stop anymore? Hmm, in the current active rules, there's no ""wall is stop"", so maybe walls can now be moved over? But I need to check the latest observations.

Looking at the latest observation, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the wall's property might have changed. Wait, in the previous steps, when the user had ""wall is stop"" as an active rule, but now it's not. So does that mean walls are no longer stop? Or does the absence of the rule mean their default property is back? In Baba Is You, if a rule like ""wall is stop"" is removed, then walls might not be stop anymore. So perhaps I can push past the walls now?

But the current object list shows a wall at 1 step to the right. So if walls are not stop, I can move through them. Wait, but the key is 4 steps to the right. Let me map this out.

Baba is the player, controlled by me. The key is 4 steps to the right. Between me and the key, there's a wall at 1 step to the right. If I can move right past that wall, then I can get the key. But since the active rules don't have ""wall is stop"", maybe the wall isn't blocking. So I can just walk right through it.

Wait, but the rules might still be applied. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop"" not present, does that mean it's not active? Yes. So walls are not stop anymore. Therefore, I can move right past the wall at 1 step to the right. Then continue moving right to reach the key, which is 4 steps to the right. So the path would be: move right four times. But let me confirm the exact positions.

The current position of Baba isn't explicitly mentioned, but looking at the objects: the wall is 1 step to the right. So assuming Baba is at position 0, the wall is at 1, key at 4. So moving right four times would get to the key. But need to check if there are any other obstacles. Between 1 and 4, there's another wall at 1 step down, but that's not in the way vertically. So the straight path right should be clear.

Alternatively, maybe the key is reachable by moving right past the wall. So the best action is to move right repeatedly. Since the user's previous attempts had failures, maybe there's a specific step where the action is needed. But given the current observation, the key is 4 steps to the right, and the wall at 1 step right is not stopping me. So the correct action is to move right.

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key, which is the same as winning. But I'm Baba, so since ""baba is you"", I can move around. The walls are still stop, right? Because the active rules don't say wall is anything else. So I need to navigate past the walls to reach the key.

Looking at the map, the key is 5 steps to the right. But there's a rule 'stop' 3 steps to the left. Wait, the objects listed have the key at 3 steps to the right. Let me parse the objects again.

The objects are:
- rule `stop` 3 step to the left
- rule `key` 3 steps to the right
- rule `is` 4 steps to the right
- rule `win` 5 steps to the right
Then there are walls at various positions below, like wall 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc., up to 6 steps down. And the rule blocks for baba are at 5 steps left and 6 steps down.

So my position isn't explicitly stated here. But the key is to the right. But moving right directly might hit a wall? Wait, the walls are starting from 1 step down, but maybe above that? The active rules have ""wall is stop"", so any wall is immovable. Let me check the current position. Wait, the observation doesn't mention my position. Maybe I'm assumed to be at the starting point, perhaps near the baba rule blocks?

Wait, in the previous steps, the user's actions led to moving right multiple times, and the map is shifting perhaps? Because each time the action is taken, the positions of the rules and walls might change. But in the latest observation, the key is 3 steps to the right. The 'stop' rule is 3 steps to the left. So if I'm facing the right direction, moving right three times would get me to the key. But I need to check if there are walls blocking the path.

Looking at the objects below, there are walls at 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc. But those are below, not in the way of moving right. The walls mentioned in the active rules are the ones defined by the rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule means any object labeled 'wall' is a stop. So in the current objects, the walls are positioned at 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc. But when moving right, those are below, so not in the path. The only obstacle might be the 'stop' rule at 3 steps to the left. Wait, the 'stop' rule is a text block that says ""stop"", which according to the rules, anything that is 'stop' cannot be moved. But how does that affect movement? If I'm trying to move into a position where there's a 'stop' rule, does that block me?

Wait, the rules are about the properties of objects. So if there's a text block saying ""stop"", it defines that whatever it's applied to is stop. But in the current active rules, it's ""wall is stop"", so walls are stops. But if there's a separate ""stop"" rule without a subject, maybe it's not active? Wait, the active rules listed are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""stop"" rule mentioned in the objects is a rule block, but it's not active unless it's part of the active rules. So maybe the ""stop"" rule is not currently enforcing anything because it's not in the active rules. Wait, no, active rules are the ones that are currently on the map as active. So the 'stop' rule is present but maybe not applied to anything. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, a rule like ""X IS Y"" makes X have the property Y. If there's a rule ""stop IS [something]"", but in this case, the rule `stop` is just a text block. Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` 3 steps to the left. That means there's a text block on the map that says ""stop"", but unless it's part of an active rule like ""A IS STOP"", it doesn't do anything. Since the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", the ""stop"" rule block is just sitting there and doesn't affect anything. So walls are still defined by ""wall is stop"", so any wall object is stop. But the 'stop' rule block itself isn't doing anything.

So the path to the key is 3 steps to the right. Let me check if moving right three times is possible. But in the previous steps, each action moved the view, perhaps? Because when the user moved right, the position of the key shifted. For example, initially, the key was 7 steps to the right, then it moved left as the player moved right. Now, the key is 3 steps to the right. So maybe I need to move right three times to reach it. But I need to confirm if there are any walls in the way.

Looking at the current objects, the walls are below at 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc. So if I'm moving right horizontally, those walls are below and shouldn't block the vertical movement. The only possible issue is if there's a wall in the same horizontal row. But in the current observation, the walls are positioned at 1 step down, so if I'm moving right on the same level, there are no walls in the way. Therefore, the correct action is to keep moving right towards the key. Since the key is 3 steps to the right, I should move right three times. But since in each step, the action is a single move, I need to choose 'right' each time. However, the current observation shows the key is 3 steps to the right, so the next move should be right to get closer. Wait, but after moving right once, the key would be 2 steps away, then 1, then 0. But the problem is that each time the action is taken, the game might shift the map, but in the observations provided, the key's position is relative to the player's current position. So assuming the player is one step away from the key, moving right would reach it. But in the latest observation, the key is 5 steps to the right in one case, then 3 steps. Wait, looking back, the user's previous actions and the resulting observations show that moving right decreases the distance to the key. So perhaps the correct action now is to move right once more to grab the key, which is the win condition since ""key is win"".

Let's see. The goal is to reach the key since ""key is win"". But the current rules still have ""wall is stop"", so those walls are blocking the way. And I'm Baba, which means ""baba is you"", so I can move around but need to avoid the STOP walls.

Looking at the current observation, the key is 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall 1 step to the left. Wait, maybe I need to check the path. The active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"", so moving into a wall would stop me. 

Let me map out the positions. The player (Baba) is likely at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 6 steps to the left and 6 steps down. But the objects listed don't include Baba's position explicitly. Wait, the ""rule `baba` 6 step to the left and 6 steps down"" probably means that the Baba text block is there. But maybe the player is standing on that rule? Or is the player separate?

Wait, in Baba Is You, the player is typically represented by the ""BABA"" text block, which is movable. So the ""rule `baba` 6 step to the left and 6 steps down"" is a rule that makes Baba a YOU, meaning the player can move it. So to get to the key, I need to move right towards it. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 1 step to the left, then the key is 2 steps to the right of the rule `key`. Wait, maybe the key is positioned such that I need to move right past some walls. Let me check the positions again.

Current active rules: key is win, so getting the key would make me win. Wall is stop, so can't move into walls.

Objects on the map:

- rule `stop` 4 step to the left
- wall 1 step to the left
- rule `key` 2 steps to the right
- rule `is` 3 steps to the right
- rule `win` 4 steps to the right
- rule `wall` 6 step to the left and 1 step down
- etc., down below.

So the key is 4 steps to the right. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 1 step to the left. Wait, maybe I'm positioned such that moving right from my current position (which is where the ""baba"" rule is?) would first hit the wall at 1 step to the left. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 6 steps to the left and 6 steps down. But the wall at 1 step to the left would be in a different direction. Maybe my current position is somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule block. So if the ""baba"" rule is at 6 steps left and 6 down, then moving right would decrease the left steps. Wait, the directions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions correctly.

Each object's position is described relative to the player's current position. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" would be located at coordinates (4 right, 4 up) from the player. But directions can be tricky. Let's assume that the player is at the origin (0,0), and positions are given relative to that.

Looking at the current observation:

- The ""rule `baba`"" is at 6 steps to the left and 6 steps down. So coordinates (-6, -6).
- The ""key"" is at 2 steps to the right (so +2, 0) relative to the player's current position. Wait, but the player's position is where? Maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" text block. So if the ""baba"" rule is at (-6, -6), then the key is at (-6 + 2, -6 + 0) = (-4, -6). But I'm confused because the walls and other rules are also positioned relative to the player.

Alternatively, perhaps all positions are relative to the player's current position. So the player is at (0,0), and all other objects are positioned relative to that. For example, ""wall 4 steps to the right"" is at (4, 0), ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" is at (4,4), etc.

In the latest observation:

- The key is at 2 steps to the right, so (2,0).
- There's a wall at 1 step to the left (so (-1,0)).
- The rule `stop` is at 4 steps to the left (-4,0).
- Then, looking down, there are walls at various positions below, like 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc.

But the problem is that the path to the key (which is at (2,0)) is blocked by a wall at (-1,0). So how can I get to the key? Maybe I need to move around the wall. But how?

Wait, the rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"". So the key is the win condition. To get it, I need to move to its position. But the wall at (-1,0) is a STOP, so I can't move into it. So I need to find a way to either remove the wall's STOP property, move the wall, or change the key's position.

But how?

Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can push movable objects, but only if they aren't STOP. Wait, but the walls are defined as STOP, so they can't be moved. Unless I change the rules.

Ah, maybe the solution is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can replace ""wall is stop"" with something else, then walls would no longer be STOP and I could move through them or push them.

But how to do that? The rules are text blocks on the map. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules are part of the level's setup but are probably inactive unless moved.

Looking at the objects, there are rules like ""rule `stop` 4 step to the left"", which is a text block saying ""STOP IS..."", but it's positioned at (-4,0). To activate a new rule, I need to move the ""STOP"" text block to form a new rule. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule next to an ""is"" rule and a subject, I can create a new rule.

In this case, the ""stop"" rule is at (-4,0), and there's an ""is"" rule at (3 steps to the right and 1 step down) in previous observations. Wait, in the current observation, the ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps to the right (so (3,0)), but I need to check the exact positions.

Wait, in the current observation, the objects include:

- rule `stop` 4 step to the left (so (-4,0))
- wall 1 step to the left (-1,0)
- rule `key` 2 steps to the right (2,0)
- rule `is` 3 steps to the right (3,0)
- rule `win` 4 steps to the right (4,0)
- Then, rule `wall` 6 step to the left and 1 step down (-6,1)
- Etc., down below.

So the ""stop"" rule is at (-4,0), and the ""is"" rule is at (3,0). If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""is"" rule and a subject, I can change the rule. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block to be next to ""is"" and ""wall"", then it would create ""wall is stop"" again. But that's the existing rule. Wait, but the existing active rule is already ""wall is stop"". So maybe I need to break that rule.

Alternatively, to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall"" and ""is"" that form it. The current ""wall is stop"" rule is likely formed by the ""wall"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and the ""stop"" text block placed together. So if I can separate them, the rule would be broken.

Looking at the current setup, the ""wall"" rule is at (-6,1), ""is"" is at (3,0), and ""stop"" is at (-4,0). These aren't adjacent, so the ""wall is stop"" rule is probably not active anymore? Wait, but the active rules still show ""wall is stop"". That's confusing. Maybe the text blocks are arranged elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the active rules are determined by the currently placed text blocks. If the ""wall is stop"" rule is still active, that means the text blocks for ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" are arranged to form that rule. So I need to move those text blocks to break the rule.

In the current observation, the ""rule `wall`"" is at 6 steps to the left and 1 step down (-6,1), ""rule `is`"" is at 5 steps to the left and 1 step down (-5,1), and ""rule `stop`"" is at 4 steps to the left (so (-4,0)). These aren't adjacent, so the ""wall is stop"" rule might not be active. But according to the active rules, it still is. Hmm, maybe the level's initial setup has that rule, and it's persistent unless changed.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"", which suggests that those two rules are currently in effect. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is active, meaning walls are immovable.

To proceed, I need to either avoid the walls or remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since I can't move through walls, the only option is to change the rules.

How to do that? The ""stop"" rule is a text block at (-4,0). If I can move it away from the ""is"" and ""wall"" that form the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the rule would be deactivated. But where are the other parts of that rule?

The ""wall"" part of the rule is likely the ""rule `wall`"" at (-6,1), and the ""is"" is at (-5,1). So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by placing ""wall"" next to ""is"" next to ""stop"". Currently, the ""stop"" is at (-4,0), which is not adjacent to the ""is"" at (-5,1). So maybe the rule is no longer active, but the system still considers it active? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the active rules are separate from the text blocks on the map. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, the active rules are determined by the text blocks on the map. So if the text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are not adjacent, the rule shouldn't be active. But according to the observation, it's still active. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the level's initial setup has those rules, and they can only be changed by moving the relevant text blocks. Since the active rules are still ""wall is stop"", I need to find the text blocks that form this rule and disrupt them.

Looking at the objects, the ""rule `wall`"" is at (-6,1), ""rule `is`"" is at (-5,1), and ""rule `stop`"" is at (-4,0). These are not adjacent, so the ""wall is stop"" rule shouldn't be active. But the observation says it is active. This is confusing. Maybe there's a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by a different set of text blocks. For example, in previous steps, the user might have moved some text blocks, but in the current observation, the active rules are still showing ""wall is stop"". This could be a bug or a misunderstanding in the observation.

Assuming that the ""wall is stop"" rule is still active, meaning walls are immovable, the path to the key is blocked. So I need to either move the key, which is probably not possible since it's a WIN object, or find a way to pass through the walls by changing their properties.

To change ""wall is stop"" to something else, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" rule is at (-4,0). If I can move it next to a different subject and ""is"", I can create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", it would create ""baba is stop"", making Baba stop, which is bad. But if I move it to create ""key is stop"", then the key would be stop, but the goal is to get the key.

Alternatively, create ""you is stop"", but that would make the player stop. Not helpful.

Alternatively, find a way to make walls not stop. For example, create ""wall is push"" or something else. But I need to see if there are other text blocks available.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `key`"", ""rule `is`"", ""rule `win`"", etc. Maybe I can combine them. For instance, move the ""stop"" text block to be next to ""wall"" and ""not"" (if there's a ""not"" block), but there's no ""not"" mentioned here.

Alternatively, create ""stop is win"", so stopping becomes winning. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, the key is at (2,0), and there's a wall at (-1,0). If I can move past the wall by changing the direction, but I can't move through it. So maybe I need to find a different path, like going around down.

Looking at the objects, there are walls down below at 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc., but also a ""rule `you`"" at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. Maybe there's a way to reach the key by going around through the lower paths.

But how to get there? Let's think. If I move down from the current position, but I don't know where the player is located. The ""baba"" rule is at (-6, -6), so the player is there. To move right towards the key at (2,0), but blocked by a wall at (-1,0). So moving right from (-6,-6) would go towards increasing the x-coordinate. The key is at (2,0), which is to the right and up from the player's position.

Wait, maybe the player's position is at the ""baba"" rule's location, which is (-6,-6). The key is at 2 steps to the right (so x= -6 + 2 = -4, y= -6 + 0 = -6). The wall at 1 step to the left is at x= -6 -1 = -7, y=-6. So the key is at (-4,-6), and the wall is at (-7,-6). The path to the key is clear to the right, but there's a wall at (-7,-6), which is further left. So maybe the player is between the wall and the key. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at (0,0), and all positions are relative. So the key is at (2,0), the wall at (-1,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (6,6) (since it's 6 steps left and 6 down from (0,0)). That would mean the player is at (6,6), and the key is at (2,0), which is to the left and down. There's a wall at (-1,0), which is to the left of the player. So the path to the key requires moving left past the wall at (-1,0), but that's blocked by STOP.

So to get to the key, I need to either remove the STOP property from the wall or find another way.

Since the active rule is ""wall is stop"", the wall is immovable. So the only option is to change that rule.

The ""stop"" text block is at (-4,0). If I can move it to form a different rule, like ""baba is stop"", which would make the player stop, but that's bad. Alternatively, move it to create ""key is stop"", making the key a STOP, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, find a way to make walls not STOP. For example, if I can create ""wall is push"", then walls could be pushed. But there's no ""push"" text block in the current objects.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `win`"" at (4,0), ""rule `is`"" at (3,0), and ""rule `key`"" at (2,0). If I can move the ""stop"" text block at (-4,0) to be next to ""wall"", ""is"", and something else, maybe I can redefine wall's property.

For example, moving the ""stop"" block to be after ""wall"" and ""is"", creating ""wall is [something]"". If I can place ""stop"" next to ""wall"" and ""is"", it would make ""wall is stop"". But that's the existing rule. To change it, I need to replace ""stop"" with another property.

But where are other property text blocks? The objects include ""rule `win`"", ""rule `key`"", etc. Maybe ""rule `win`"" can be used. If I can move ""win"" next to ""wall"" and ""is"", then ""wall is win"", making walls the win condition. But then touching a wall would win, which might not help.

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"", making the player win by touching itself. But the player is already Baba, so ""baba is you"" and ""baba is win"" would mean touching Baba makes you win. But the key is still needed.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Need to reach the key at (2,0).
- Blocked by a wall at (-1,0) which is STOP.
- Active rules: key is win, wall is stop.
- Text blocks available: stop at (-4,0), is at (3,0), key at (2,0), wall at (-6,1), etc.

To break ""wall is stop"", need to disjoint the text blocks forming it. The current ""wall is stop"" rule is likely formed by ""wall"" at (-6,1), ""is"" at (-5,1), and ""stop"" at (-4,0). These are not adjacent, so the rule shouldn't be active. But the observation says it is. Therefore, maybe there's another arrangement.","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to reach the key because it's defined as win. But how do I get there?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall 1 step to the left and another wall 1 step down from the key. Also, there's a rule ""stop"" 4 steps to the left. Wait, but maybe I can move the rules to change the stop property. The rules are scattered around. 

The key is 2 steps to the right. If I move right twice, I can get there, but there's a wall 1 step to the left of the key. But according to the active rules, walls are stop. So if I'm Baba (since ""baba is you""), moving into the wall would stop me. 

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. If I can make the wall not a stop, or change what I am. For example, if I can make ""baba is stop"", then I could push through walls. Or if I can make ""wall is you"", then maybe walls become moveable. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 4 step to the left"". If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. Or take the ""key is win"" rule and move it to another position? Wait, no, the key itself is the win object. Hmm. 

Wait, the key is 2 steps to the right. The current position must be where Baba is, based on the ""baba is you"" rule. So from my current position, I need to move right twice. But there's a wall 1 step to the left of the key. Wait, the wall is 1 step to the left of the key? So the key is at position X, and the wall is one step left of that. So if the key is 2 steps to the right, then the wall is 1 step left of the key, which would be 1 step to the right of my current position. So if I move right once, I hit a wall. Then I can't go further right. 

But maybe I can move the wall rule. The rule ""wall is stop"" is located 6 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can change what makes a wall stop. Or maybe I can combine rules. 

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that makes ""baba can go through walls"". For example, if I take the ""stop"" rule and rearrange it. But I need to find the text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps to the left. The ""wall"" rule is at 6 steps left and 1 step down. 

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule next to the key so that it's active. But the key is already defined as win, so maybe that's already the case. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to push the key. But can I push objects? In Baba Is You, pushing is possible if the object isn't stopped. But since the wall is stop, and the key is win, but I don't know if the key can be pushed. 

Wait, the key is win, so maybe touching it is enough. But I can't get past the wall. So how to remove the stop property from the wall? 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away or change it. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 steps to the left. If I can move that rule, then walls would no longer be stop. So maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule to a different position. 

But to move a rule, I have to be able to move the text blocks that make up the rule. The ""stop"" rule is a text block ""stop"", and it's located 4 steps to the left. So if I can move that ""stop"" text block somewhere else, maybe I can remove its effect. 

But how do I move the text blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and move them in a direction, provided they aren't stopped. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. If the rule ""stop"" is present, then any object with the stop property can't be moved. But the ""stop"" rule is a text block, so if it's not part of another rule, maybe it can be moved. 

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is a subject ""stop"" and property ""is""? No, the rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the ""stop"" rule here is likely part of another rule. Wait, looking at the active rules, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""stop"" rule must be part of another rule, maybe ""wall is stop"". But in the current observation, the active rules don't include ""wall is stop"", but there's a rule object ""stop"" 4 steps to the left. 

So maybe the ""stop"" rule is a standalone text block that's not part of an active rule. That means I can move it. Because if a text block isn't part of an active rule (i.e., not forming ""X IS Y""), then it can be moved. 

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule (the text block) away so that the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer active. Then, walls wouldn't be stop, and I can move through them. 

But where is the ""wall is stop"" rule located? Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""wall"" 6 steps to the left and 1 step down, followed by ""is"" and ""stop"". So those three text blocks form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move those text blocks apart, the rule would be broken. 

So perhaps I need to move the ""stop"" text block (which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule) away. The ""stop"" text block is at 4 steps to the left. Wait, no. Let me check the objects again. 

In the current observation, the objects include:

- rule `stop` 4 step to the left
- wall 1 step to the left
- rule `key` 2 steps to the right
- etc.

So the ""stop"" rule is a text block located 4 steps to the left. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" positioned in a way that forms that rule. To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to separate those text blocks. 

Assuming the ""stop"" text block that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule is the one at 4 steps to the left, moving that ""stop"" text block away would break the rule. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the ""stop"" text block that's 4 steps to the left.
2. Once adjacent, move it in a direction to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
4. Then, move right to reach the key.

But how to get to the ""stop"" text block? My current position is such that the ""stop"" is 4 steps to the left. So I need to move left 4 times. But wait, the wall is 1 step to the left. If I move left, would I hit the wall? Since walls are stop, and I'm Baba (you), moving into a wall would stop me. So I can't move left past the wall. 

This is a problem. The wall is 1 step to the left, blocking my path to the ""stop"" text block which is 4 steps left. So I can't reach the ""stop"" text block directly because of the wall. 

Alternative idea: Maybe I can use other text blocks to create a new rule that allows me to move left past the wall. For example, if I can make Baba immune to stop, like ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba is push"". 

But to create such a rule, I need to find the necessary text blocks. The available text blocks nearby are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", etc. 

If I can move the ""baba"" text block (which is part of the ""baba is you"" rule) and combine it with ""not stop"" or ""push"". But I don't see a ""not"" or ""push"" text block on the map. 

Looking at the objects, the rules present are ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". The other text blocks are ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc. 

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing rules. For example, take the ""is"" from the ""baba is you"" rule and combine it with something else. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps to the left and 5 steps down, I think. Wait, in the current observation, the objects include:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 5 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 5 steps down
rule `you` 2 steps down

So the ""baba is you"" rule is made up of the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"" positioned accordingly. If I can break that rule, maybe I can become something else. But breaking it would remove ""baba is you"", which would make me not you anymore, which is bad. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is stop"", which would make me stop when hitting walls. But that's counterproductive. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I can push the key towards me. But can I push the key? The key's rule is ""key is win"", but not necessarily ""key is push"". Unless there's a rule that allows pushing. 

In Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not stopped. So if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move through it and possibly push other objects. 

But how to remove the stop property from walls. As before, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. But I can't reach the ""stop"" text block because of the wall. 

Wait, maybe there's another way. If I can move the ""wall"" text block part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" text block is at 6 steps to the left and 1 step down. If I can move that ""wall"" text block away, the rule would break. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""wall"" text block at 6 left, 1 down.
2. Move it in a direction that separates it from ""is"" and ""stop"".

But to get there, I need to navigate around the walls. My current position is such that moving left is blocked by a wall. So maybe I need to move down or up to get around. 

Looking at the current position, the key is 2 steps to the right, and the wall is 1 step to the left. If I move down, maybe there's a path. 

Wait, the objects also include walls at various down positions. For example, there's a wall 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc., all the way to 6 steps down. So moving down seems blocked as well. 

Alternative idea: Use the ""key is win"" rule to reach the key by moving right twice, but bypass the wall somehow. Since the wall is 1 step left of the key, which is 2 steps to the right from me, moving right once would take me to the position 1 step right, which is the wall. Then moving right again would hit the wall. 

So unless I can move the wall, which I can't because it's stopped, I can't get past. 

Wait, but the wall's property is stop because of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can remove that rule, the wall becomes movable. 

But again, the ""stop"" part of that rule is 4 steps to the left, which I can't reach. 

Is there any other text block I can use? Like the ""win"" text block. If I can create a rule that makes ""baba is win"", then touching anything win (like the key) would make me win. But the key is already win. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is key"", then I would be the key and automatically win. 

To do that, I need to rearrange the ""key is win"" rule. The ""key"" text block is 2 steps to the right, ""is"" is 3 steps to the right, ""win"" is 4 steps to the right. So the ""key is win"" rule is formed by those three. If I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""you"", maybe I can create ""baba is you"" into ""baba is key"". 

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 2 steps left and 5 steps down, with ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"" arranged. If I can move the ""is"" from there to connect with ""baba"" and ""key"", that could work. 

So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""is"" text block that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule.
2. Swap or move it to connect ""baba"" with ""key"", creating ""baba is key"".
3. Now, since I'm baba and key, I would automatically win by being the key.

But how to do that? Let's see. The ""baba"" text block is 2 steps left and 5 steps down, the ""is"" is 1 step left and 5 steps down, and ""you"" is 2 steps down. The ""key"" is 2 steps to the right. 

So if I can move the ""is"" text block from its current position (1 step left, 5 down) to be between ""baba"" and ""key"", that would form ""baba is key"". 

To move the ""is"" text block, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""is"" is 1 step left and 5 steps down from my current position. My current position is unknown, but based on the objects, perhaps I'm somewhere in the middle. 

Assuming I can move down to reach the ""is"" text block. Let's see:

Current obstacles:

- Moving left is blocked by a wall 1 step left.
- Moving right is blocked by a wall 1 step left of the key (so 1 step right from me).
- Moving down leads to walls further down.

But maybe there's a path down that's clear. For example, the wall at 1 step down is there, but maybe I can move past it if I'm not stopped. Wait, if walls are stop, then moving into them stops me. 

Alternatively, if I can make myself not stop. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to try to move the ""stop"" text block away. Even if I can't reach it directly, maybe there's another way. 

Wait, another possibility: If I can create a new rule that overrides the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, ""baba can move through walls"" by creating a rule like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is not stop"". 

To do that, I need the necessary text blocks. The available text blocks are ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"", ""key"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"". 

If I can take the ""baba"" text block, combine it with ""is"", and then with ""not stop"" or ""push"". But there's no ""not"" or ""push"" text block on the map. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching anything win (the key) would make me win. 

To do that, I need to rearrange the ""key is win"" rule. The ""key"" is 2 steps to the right, ""is"" is 3 steps to the right, ""win"" is 4 steps to the right. If I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win"", forming ""baba is win"". 

So the steps would be:

1. Move right to the ""is"" text block (3 steps right).
2. Then move the ""baba"" text block (which is part of the ""baba is you"" rule) next to ""is"" and ""win"".

But the ""baba"" text block is 2 steps left and 5 steps down. To get there, I need to move left and down, but there's a wall 1 step left. 

This seems impossible. 

Alternative idea: Since the key is win, maybe I can push the key towards me. But to push, the key must not be stopped. The key's rule is ""key is win"", but not necessarily ""key is push"". So unless there's a rule allowing pushing, I can't push it. 

Given all this, the most feasible solution seems to be breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block away. Even though I can't reach it directly due to the wall, maybe there's another way. 

Wait, perhaps the ""stop"" text block I'm seeing is not part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of different text blocks. Let me check the objects again. 

The objects include:

- rule `wall` 6 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `is` 5 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `stop` 4 step to the left

So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the text blocks at 6 left,1 down (wall), 5 left,1 down (is), and 4 left (stop). To break this rule, I need to move any of these three text blocks away. 

Assuming the ""stop"" text block at 4 left is part of this rule, moving it away would break it. But I can't reach it because of the wall. 

Is there a way to move the ""wall"" or ""is"" text blocks instead? The ""wall"" text block is at 6 left,1 down. To move that, I need to be adjacent to it. But my current position is unknown, but based on the objects, perhaps I'm in a position where I can move down to reach that area. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use other rules to move the text blocks. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"", then I can push the text blocks. But to create that rule, I need the necessary text blocks. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move right twice despite the wall, but that's impossible. Alternatively, there's a way to interact with the text blocks nearby to change the rules. 

Wait, another angle:","

32,down,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the correct action here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, my goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move around.

Looking at the objects, the key is 1 step down from me. There's a wall 1 step to the left, so I can't go left. The rule ""stop"" is 4 steps to the left, but that's probably a wall with the stop property. The walls are all aligned to the left, but the key is directly down. 

I need to check if there are any obstacles between me and the key. The current position has a key 1 step down. Since ""wall is stop"", if there's a wall in the path, I can't move through it. But the objects listed don't show any walls between me and the key. The walls are either to the left or further down. 

So the path down should be clear. Therefore, moving down towards the key should be possible. Let me confirm the direction again. The key is 1 step down, so the correct action is ""down"".
