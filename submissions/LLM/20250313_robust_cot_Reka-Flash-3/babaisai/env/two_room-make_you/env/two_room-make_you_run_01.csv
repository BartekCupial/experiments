Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. So the current active rules are: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which in this case is the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are at various positions, and since wall is stop, I can't go through them. So I need a way to either remove the walls or make them passable.

First, I need to locate where Baba is. The rule says ""rule baba 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". So Baba's position is 1 left and 3 down from the 'baba' rule text block. But maybe it's easier to just check the map. The objects list has a ball at 7 right, 4 down and a key at 8 right, 4 down. But the walls are 4 steps right in various positions, probably forming a barrier.

Since I'm Baba (because baba is you), I can move around. The immediate goal is to get to the key. Let's see the path. From Baba's position (assuming the rule is at some coordinate, but maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point). Wait, maybe I need to visualize the map. Let's try to sketch it out based on the given object positions.

The map probably has multiple rows. Let's consider the vertical coordinates. The walls at 4 steps right and 2 up, 1 up, same level, down, etc. The key and ball are at 4 steps down. So there's a vertical column at 4 steps right with walls going up and down, creating a barrier. The key is 7 right, 4 down, which is to the right of that barrier. Baba is at 1 left and 3 down from the 'baba' rule. Let's assume the 'baba' rule is at a certain position. For example, if the 'baba is you' rule is at position (0,0), then Baba would be at (-1, -3). But this might not be the exact coordinate system. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the game's grid. 

Alternatively, perhaps the walls are arranged in a way that blocks the path from Baba to the key. The key is to the right, so maybe there's a wall to the right of Baba that's stop. But since I'm Baba, I can move around unless blocked. Wait, but if there's a wall in front, I can't pass. Let's check the walls around Baba's position.

Baba's position is 1 step left and 3 steps down from the 'baba' rule. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps right (from the objects list: rule 'baba' 2 steps to the right). So if the 'baba' rule is at (2,0), then Baba would be at (2 -1, 0 -3) = (1, -3). Now, looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps up (from where?), maybe from the same starting point. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the active rules and possible actions to manipulate them.

The key is win, so I need to reach the key. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them. But since I'm Baba (you), maybe I can move around the walls. However, the walls are arranged in such a way that the path to the key is blocked. Let's look at the wall positions:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down

So these walls form a vertical column from 2 steps up to 4 steps down at x=4 (assuming right is positive x). The key is at x=7, y=4. So to get to the key, I need to go right from x=4 to x=7, but the path is blocked. Wait, but maybe the walls are only at x=4, so from x=4 to x=7, there's nothing blocking except maybe the key's position. But the key is at x=8, y=4. Wait, the key is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. So the path from x=4 (the wall column) to x=8 requires moving right past the walls, but the walls are only at x=4. So maybe the path is open to the right. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the walls are arranged in a horizontal line. Wait, no, the steps are all in the same x direction (right) but varying y. So they form a vertical line at x=4. Therefore, to get from x=1 (Baba's position) to x=7, I need to move right past x=4, but the walls at x=4 are from y=2 up to y=4. So if I move right from x=1 to x=4, I would be at x=4, but the walls there are at various y positions. Let's assume Baba is at (1, -3). To move right to x=4, he would have to pass through x=4, y=-3. Looking at the walls at x=4, the lowest wall is at y=4 steps down (which is y=-4, assuming up is positive). So moving right from x=1, y=-3 to x=4, y=-3 would require passing through x=4, y=-3. Are there any walls there? The walls at x=4 are at y=2 up (y=2), y=1 up (y=1), same y (y=0), y=1 down (y=-1), y=2 down (y=-2), y=3 down (y=-3), y=4 down (y=-4). So at y=-3 (Baba's current y), there is a wall at x=4, y=-3. So Baba cannot move right into that wall because it's a stop. Therefore, he's blocked at x=4, y=-3.

So how can he get past the wall? Since the wall is a stop, he can't go through it. But maybe he can change the rules to make the wall not a stop. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. If I can change 'wall is stop' to something else, like 'wall is push' or 'stop is wall', then maybe he can move around. But how to do that?

The game allows moving text blocks to create new rules. The rules are formed by text blocks like ""wall is stop"". So the current rules are made by combining three text blocks: subject, 'is', property. So to change a rule, I need to move one of these text blocks to form a new rule.

Looking at the objects list, there are several rule text blocks:

- rule `wall` 1 step left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 2 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step right and 2 step up
- rule `key` 7 steps right and 2 step up
- rule `is` 8 steps right and 2 step up
- rule `win` 9 steps right and 2 step up
- rule `ball` 2 steps right
- rule `baba` 1 step left and 3 steps down
- rule `is` 3 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step right and 3 steps down

So the existing rules are:

1. wall is stop (from rule `wall` at left 1, up 2; rule `is` up 2; rule `stop` right 1, up 2)
2. key is win (rule `key` at 7 right, up 2; rule `is` at 8 right, up 2; rule `win` at 9 right, up 2)
3. baba is you (rule `baba` at left 1, down 3; rule `is` down 3; rule `you` right 1, down 3)

To create a new rule, I need to move these text blocks. For example, if I can take the 'stop' property and assign it to something else, like 'baba is stop', then Baba would become stop and couldn't move. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, changing 'wall is stop' to 'stop is you', which would make anything stop a you, allowing me to walk over walls. But how to form that?

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes 'wall' have a different property. For example, if I can make 'wall is push', then I could move walls out of the way. But how to do that? Let's see the available text blocks. There's a 'stop' rule, 'win', 'key', 'ball', etc. Maybe I can replace 'stop' with another property.

Wait, the current rules are:

- wall is stop (using the 'wall' rule, 'is' rule, 'stop' rule)
- key is win (using 'key', 'is', 'win')
- baba is you (using 'baba', 'is', 'you')

The other 'is' rules are at 2 step up and 3 step down. Maybe I can use the 'is' at 3 step down to create a new rule. For example, take the 'baba' rule, the 'is' at 3 step down, and the 'win' rule to make 'baba is win', which would make Baba the win object. But how to do that?

Let me think. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The 'is' at 3 steps down is right 1 from the 'baba' rule. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. So to create a new rule, I need to move these blocks together. For example, move the 'baba' rule to the position of the 'is' at 3 steps down, then add the 'win' rule. But how?

Alternatively, if I can move the 'win' rule to be after the 'baba' and 'is' rules, forming 'baba is win'. Let's see. The current 'baba is you' rule is made by the 'baba' rule at left 1, down 3; 'is' at 3 steps down; 'you' at right 1, down 3. To make 'baba is win', I would need to replace the 'you' with 'win'. But the 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up, which is far away. So I need to move the 'win' rule down to the position where 'you' is.

But how to move it? The movement actions are up, down, left, right. Since the 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up, to get to the 'you' position (which is 1 step right and 3 steps down from the 'baba' rule), I need to move it left 8 steps and down 5 steps. That's not possible with a single move. Each action is one step. So perhaps I need to move the 'win' rule step by step towards the 'is' at 3 steps down.

Wait, but the 'win' rule is part of the existing 'key is win' rule. If I detach it, maybe I can reuse it. Let me check: the 'key is win' rule is made by the 'key' rule at 7 right, up 2; 'is' at 8 right, up 2; 'win' at 9 right, up 2. If I can move the 'win' rule from its current position to the area near the 'is' at 3 steps down, then combine it with 'baba' and 'is' to make 'baba is win'.

But moving the 'win' rule step by step would take multiple moves. However, the problem requires choosing a single action. So perhaps there's a quicker way.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes 'you' a Win. For example, 'you is win'. Since the player is Baba (you), then 'you is win' would make Baba the Win object. To do that, I need to find the 'you' rule and combine it with 'win'.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'you' rule at 1 step right and 3 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. So if I can move the 'you' rule next to the 'win' rule and combine them with an 'is' rule, that could work. But again, moving them would take multiple steps.

Wait, the 'is' rules are at 2 steps up and 3 steps down. The 'you' is at 3 steps down, right 1. The 'win' is at 9 right, 2 up. So maybe I can move the 'you' rule to the position of the 'is' at 3 steps down, then attach the 'win' rule. But how?

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' at 3 steps down. The 'baba is you' rule is formed by 'baba' (left 1, down 3), 'is' (3 steps down), 'you' (right 1, down 3). If I can replace the 'you' with 'win', that would make 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule to the position of the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at right 1, down 3 from the 'baba' rule. The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 2 up. So I need to move the 'win' rule 8 steps left and 5 steps down. That's not possible in one move. But maybe there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can make a new rule that says 'stop is push'. If I can create that, then walls would be pushable, and I could move them out of the way. To create 'stop is push', I need the 'stop' rule, 'is' rule, and 'push' rule. But there's no 'push' rule in the objects. The available rules are wall, is, stop, key, win, ball, baba, you. So I can't create 'push' unless it's already there.

Alternatively, maybe use one of the existing rules. For example, take the 'stop' rule and pair it with another rule. But without a 'push' rule, that's not possible.

Another idea: Change the rule 'wall is stop' to 'wall is you'. If I can do that, then walls would become you, meaning I can walk over them. To do this, I need to take the 'wall' rule, 'is' rule, and 'you' rule. The current 'wall is stop' uses the 'stop' rule. If I can replace the 'stop' with 'you', that would work. The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So I need to move the 'you' rule to the position where 'stop' is in the 'wall is stop' rule.

The 'wall is stop' rule consists of the 'wall' rule at 1 left, 2 up; 'is' at 2 up; 'stop' at 1 right, 2 up. To change 'stop' to 'you', I need to move the 'you' rule to the position of the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 1 right, 2 up. The 'you' rule is at 1 right, 3 down. So moving the 'you' rule up 5 steps and left 0 steps? Wait, the 'you' rule is at (assuming starting point) maybe (4, 0) for the wall column. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'stop' rule is located at a specific coordinate. Let's assume the 'wall is stop' rule is formed by three blocks arranged horizontally. For example, 'wall' text block, then 'is', then 'stop'. If I can break that rule and rearrange them into 'wall is you', that would work.

To break the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to move one of the blocks. For example, if I move the 'stop' block away, then the rule is broken. Then, I can take the 'you' block and place it next to 'wall' and 'is' to form 'wall is you'.

The 'stop' block is at 1 step right and 2 step up from the 'is' block (which is at 2 step up). So the 'stop' block's position is relative. If I can move the 'stop' block away, then the original rule is broken. Then, take the 'you' block (which is at 1 right, 3 down) and move it to the position where 'stop' was, so that 'wall' is next to 'is' and 'you', forming 'wall is you'.

But moving the 'you' block from 1 right, 3 down to 1 right, 2 up would require moving up 5 steps. That's not possible in one move. However, perhaps there's a shorter path. Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'you' block step by step towards the 'stop' position. But again, each action is one step.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing 'is' at 3 steps down to create a new rule. For example, take the 'baba' rule, the 'is' at 3 steps down, and the 'win' rule to make 'baba is win'. The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 2 up, so moving it down to the 'is' at 3 steps down would take multiple steps. But since I can only move one step at a time, perhaps this isn't feasible.

Another approach: The key is at 7 right, 4 down. If I can make the key not a win, maybe I can change the win condition to Baba. For example, make 'baba is win', which would mean reaching Baba himself counts as winning. But how to do that? I need to create that rule.

The current 'baba is you' rule is at 1 left, 3 down; 'is' at 3 down; 'you' at 1 right, 3 down. If I can replace 'you","

1,down,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to get to the key or the win object. The active rules say ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So normally, the win condition is the key. But the key is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. However, there are walls blocking the path. Let me check the map layout.

From the observation, the walls are at specific positions. The player (Baba) is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. To reach the key, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are in a grid pattern. Let me visualize the grid.

Starting at Baba's position (1 left, 3 down), moving right would go towards the walls. The rule blocks at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules. The available rules to move are the text blocks: ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", ""baba is you"", ""is"" rules, ""stop"", ""ball"", etc.

The idea is to move a ""is"" text block to change a rule. For example, if I can make ""key"" something else. But the active rule is ""key is win"". If I can split that into ""key is"" and "" win"", then move ""win"" to another object. Wait, but how? The ""is"" blocks are needed to form rules. So perhaps take the ""is"" block at 2 steps up (from the first part of the rules) and move it to connect ""key"" with another property.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""ball"" rule at 2 steps right. Maybe if I can make ""key is ball"", then the key would act like a ball. But the problem is that the ball might not be a movable object unless its property changes. Alternatively, if I can change ""key is win"" to ""key is you"", then stepping on the key would make Baba a YOU, which he already is. That might not help.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the key is both a win and... nothing else. If I can delete ""key is win"" by moving the ""is"" block that connects them, then the key would no longer be a win. But how? The ""is"" block is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. So if I can move that ""is"" block away, then ""key"" would just be a key, not a win. Then the win condition would revert to whatever it was originally, but the initial rules might have defined ""win"" as something else. Wait, the original rules have ""key is win"", so the win is the key. If I remove that rule, then the default win might be another object. But based on the current active rules, ""win"" is a separate rule at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. So ""win"" is just a label, and the actual win condition is the key. If I remove ""key is win"", then the win condition is whatever is defined by the ""win"" rule. But in this case, the ""win"" rule is just a text block, so maybe the win condition is still the key. Wait, no. The ""key is win"" makes the key the win. If that rule is removed, then the win condition might revert to nothing, but usually, in Baba Is You, if there's no object defined as win, the game might not have a win condition. But perhaps in this level, there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe I need to make Baba a win. So if I can create a rule ""baba is win"", then stepping on Baba (which is you) would make you a win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block somewhere. Let's see. The ""is"" blocks are at 2 steps up, 3 steps down, and others. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. So if I can take the ""is"" block at 2 steps up (near the wall rules) and move it to connect ""baba"" with ""win"".

But where is the ""baba"" rule? The rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down, which is where Baba is located. The ""is"" block is at 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""is"" block from 3 steps down to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", that would create ""baba is win"". Then, since Baba is you, you would be win. So just moving to where you are would make you win. But how to get to that ""is"" block?

The current position of Baba is 1 left, 3 down. The ""is"" block needed is at 3 steps down. So from Baba's position, moving down once would reach that ""is"" block. But wait, are there walls blocking the path? Let's check the path from Baba's position (1 left, 3 down) to the ""is"" block at 3 steps down. Moving down one step from (1 left, 3 down) would take him to (1 left, 4 down). Are there walls there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down, but that's far to the right. So moving down from Baba's position, he can move down without hitting a wall. So the path is clear. Once he moves down to the ""is"" block, he can pick it up (since ""baba is you"" allows moving unless blocked by stop). Then, he needs to move that ""is"" block to connect ""baba"" with ""win"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down (Baba's position). The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. So the plan is:

1. Move down from Baba's position to get to the ""is"" block at 3 steps down.
2. Carry the ""is"" block to the ""baba"" rule (which is where Baba is) and then to the ""win"" rule.

Wait, but how to attach the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""baba"" rule is at his position, and the ""win"" rule is far to the right and up. So after picking up the ""is"" block, he needs to move right and up to place it between ""baba"" and ""win"".

So step by step:

- From (1 left, 3 down), move down once to (1 left, 4 down) to get the ""is"" block.
- Then move right towards the ""win"" rule. But there are walls at 4 steps right in various positions. So need to navigate around them. For example, move right until reaching 4 steps right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right, 4 right and 1 up, 4 right and 1 down, 4 right and 2 down, etc. So moving right from 1 left, 4 down, moving right 3 steps would get to 2 left, 4 down. Then right again to 1 left (wait, no, directions might be confusing). Maybe better to map the coordinates.

Assuming Baba's starting position is (0,0), but the problem uses relative steps. The exact coordinates might be tricky, but the key is to avoid walls. So moving right from Baba's position (1 left, 3 down) would be towards positive x-axis. The walls at 4 steps right are likely blocking direct movement. So perhaps moving up first to get around the walls.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""is"" block, move right past the walls. Let's see:

From the ""is"" block at (1 left, 4 down), move right until reaching the ""win"" rule at (9 right, 2 up). But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So need to go around. Maybe move up to avoid the wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. Let's try:

1. Grab the ""is"" block at 3 steps down.
2. Move right, avoiding the walls. For example, move right until 4 steps right is a wall, so move up a bit then right.
3. Place the ""is"" next to ""baba"" (which is at his original position) and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".

Once that rule is active, since Baba is you, you become win. So just standing on Baba (yourself) would satisfy the win condition.

So the sequence of actions would be:

- Down (to get the ""is"" block)
- Right multiple times, avoiding walls
- Up as needed
- Place the ""is"" between ""baba"" and ""win""

But the user needs to output a single action. Wait, no—the current observation is the state, and the agent needs to choose one action (like up, down, left, right, idle). But the previous attempt failed because the output was invalid. So the user is expecting the assistant to think through and select the correct action based on the current state.

Wait, the current observation is the same as before. The previous answer tried to explain the steps but didn't output a valid action. The user then provided the same observation again, and now the assistant needs to output exactly one action (like up, down, etc.) in the specified format.

So the correct approach here is to determine the next immediate action needed to progress towards the solution.

Given that the goal is to move the ""is"" block to create ""baba is win"", the first step is to reach the ""is"" block at 3 steps down. From Baba's current position (1 left, 3 down), moving down once (to 1 left, 4 down) would allow him to pick up the ""is"" block there. So the action should be ""down"".

Yes, that's the immediate next action. Once he moves down, he can take the ""is"" block and then proceed to move it to the correct position. But since the user is asking for only one action, the correct choice now is to move down to grab the ""is"" block.

Let's see. Baba is You, so I can manipulate the rules. The goal is usually to reach a WIN, but here the key is already set as WIN. So maybe I need to get the key to become the WIN, but the key's position hasn't changed. The key is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down, right?

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So I can move because I'm Baba and ""you"". The walls are stop, so I can't walk through them. Let me look at the map. 

In the current observation, the rule blocks have moved. The wall rule is now 3 steps up, and the baba rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So Baba is at that position. The key is still a win, so touching the key would be the goal. But where is Baba located?

Looking at the objects, rule `baba` is 1 step left and 2 steps down from some point. Wait, the exact position might depend on the reference point. Maybe the map's coordinate system starts from a certain point. But perhaps I need to figure out my position relative to the key.

The key is at 8 right, 4 down. If I can move towards that, avoiding walls. Let's check the path. The walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. For example, 4 right, 4 right and 1 down, 2 down, etc. So the path might be blocked. 

Wait, from Baba's current position (1 left, 2 down), maybe I can move right. Let's see. If I go right once, would that take me to the 0 left, 2 down position? But there's a wall at 4 steps right, but maybe that's further. Alternatively, maybe I need to move down to get closer to the key. 

The key is 8 right and 4 down. If I'm at 1 left (so 3 right) and 2 down, moving right three times would get to 6 right, which is still left of the key's 8 right. But between 6 and 8 right, there's a wall at 4 right (which is position 4), and then walls further right. Wait, maybe the way is blocked. Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to change the stop property or make something else movable.

The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If I can move the 'is' rule or the 'win' rule, maybe I can change what is considered a win. For example, if I make 'key' not win anymore and instead make 'baba' win, then reaching Baba (myself) would win. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, if I can make 'baba' a different property, like 'win', then I could just stay in place. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. Let's see the current rule positions. 

The rule 'win' is at 9 right and 3 up. The rule 'key' is at 7 right and 3 up. The 'is' rules are at 2 up, 3 up, etc. So perhaps I can move the 'win' rule to associate with Baba. For that, I need to take the 'win' text block and move it next to 'baba' and 'is'.

But to do that, I need to move the 'win' rule from 9 right, 3 up to where? The 'baba' rule is at 1 left and 3 down, but in the current observation, the 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, the observation shows rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can bring the 'win' rule next to that 'baba' and an 'is' rule, then changing the rule to 'baba is win' would make me the win condition. 

But how to move those blocks? The key is at 8 right, 4 down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 3 up. The 'is' rules are at various positions. Let's see, maybe I can move down towards the 'baba' rule. From my current position (assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's location), which is 1 left and 2 down. If I move right, I can get to the same level as the other rules. 

Wait, the 'is' rule at 2 steps down is 1 step right and 2 steps down. So if I move right once, I'm at 0 left (original position) and 2 down. Then maybe move down to reach the 'baba' rule's position? Or perhaps I can move the 'win' rule down and right. 

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to move towards the key. Let me check the path again. From my position (1 left, 2 down), moving right would take me towards the walls at 4 right. Wait, the wall at 4 right is straight ahead. Maybe I need to go around it. If I move down, perhaps I can find a path. Let's see:

Current position: let's assume the reference point is the 'baba' rule. So if the 'baba' rule is 1 left and 2 down from some origin, maybe the origin is a certain tile. Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out with coordinates. This is getting a bit complicated. 

Alternatively, let's think about the active rules. Since key is win, touching the key would win. So the goal is to reach the key at 8 right, 4 down. How to get there?

From the current position (assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's location: 1 left, 2 down), moving right three times would get to 6 right, 2 down. But there's a wall at 4 right. So can't go straight right. Maybe need to move down first. If I move down once, I'm at 1 left, 3 down. Then move right as much as possible. But the walls are at 4 right in various positions. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall aside by moving it, but since walls are stop, I can't move them unless they are not stop. Wait, the rule says 'wall is stop', but if I can change that, maybe. For example, if I make 'wall' not stop, then I can move through walls. But how?

To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. For example, if I take the 'stop' rule and move it away, then 'wall' would no longer be stop, allowing me to move through walls. But where are the 'stop' rule's position? In the current observation, the 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 3 up. 

So if I can move the 'stop' rule away, then walls wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block. To move a text block, I have to be next to it and move in a direction, carrying it. But I'm at 1 left and 2 down. The 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 3 up. The distance between me and the 'stop' rule is quite far. Need to navigate there. 

Alternatively, maybe a quicker way is to reach the key by rearranging the rules. The key is at 8 right, 4 down. If I can make the 'win' rule associated with the key, but it's already key is win. So touching the key would win. Maybe the problem is that I can't reach the key because of walls. So focus on moving through or around the walls. 

Looking at the map layout:

- There's a wall at 4 right in multiple positions (1 up, 2 down, 3 down, etc.), creating a barrier on the right side. The key is at 8 right, which is beyond these walls. So to get there, I need to either move the walls (by changing their properties) or find a path around them.

Since I can't move the walls if they are 'stop', maybe I need to change the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule or the 'wall' rule. For example, if I can move the 'is' that connects 'wall' to 'stop' away, then wall would no longer be stop. 

The 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the 'wall' text block, an 'is' text block, and a 'stop' text block. Their positions are:

- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 2 step up (so the 'wall' block is there)
- rule `is` 2 step up (the 'is' block)
- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 2 step up (the 'stop' block)

So these three blocks form 'wall is stop'. To break this rule, I need to move at least one of these blocks. 

If I can take the 'is' block from 2 step up and move it elsewhere, then the rule 'wall is stop' would be broken. Similarly, if I take the 'stop' block away, the rule would change. 

But how to reach those blocks? From my current position (1 left, 2 down), moving up might be possible. Let's see:

Current position: 1 left, 2 down (assuming 'baba' rule is here). To get to the 'is' block at 2 step up, I need to move up two steps. But the path might be blocked. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 right and 2 step up. So if I move up from my current position, where am I? If I'm at 1 left, 2 down, moving up would take me to 1 left, 1 down, then 1 left, 0 down (which is the same level as the 'is' block at 2 step up? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe I should try to move down towards the key. Let's see. If I move down once, I'm at 1 left, 3 down. Then move right. But there's a wall at 4 right and 2 steps down. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can push a wall by moving into it if it's not stop. Wait, but walls are stop, so I can't move into them. 

Wait, maybe the solution is to change the 'key is win' rule to make 'baba' win. For that, I need to create 'baba is win' by moving the 'win' block next to 'baba' and 'is'. 

The 'win' block is at 9 right, 3 up. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left, 2 down. The 'is' blocks are at various positions, like 3 step down. 

So perhaps I can move the 'win' block down and right to associate with 'baba'. To do that, I need to navigate to the 'win' block's location. 

From my current position (1 left, 2 down), moving right three times gets to 6 right, 2 down. Then moving up to reach the 'win' block at 3 up. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe moving down to 1 left, 3 down, then right to 0 left, 3 down, then right again to 1 left, 3 down. Not sure. 

This is tricky. Maybe the first step is to move down from the current position to get closer to the key's location. The key is at 8 right, 4 down. If I move down once, I'm at 1 left, 3 down. Then maybe move right. But there's a wall at 4 right and 3 steps down. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best immediate action is to move down to reach a safer position or to find a way to maneuver the rules. 

So, considering all this, the chosen action is to move down to get closer to the 'baba' rule's area or to find a path towards the key while planning to rearrange the rules later.

The goal is to get to the key, which is currently defined as the win condition. But according to the active rules, ""key is win,"" so touching the key would make me win. But how do I reach it?

First, I need to figure out where I am. The map shows that ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the wall at 4 steps right. So my current position is probably adjacent to that wall. Let me visualize the layout.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. There are walls all along the right side at various positions, making it tricky to move through. The path to the key seems blocked by walls. But since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can potentially move around unless there's a ""stop"" rule blocking me.

The walls are all labeled as ""stop,"" so I need to find a way to bypass them. Maybe I can rearrange the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule somewhere else or replace it, or change ""baba"" to have different properties.

Looking at the available rules on the map, there are several ""is"" rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 steps up, left, etc. If I can move that ""is"" block, maybe I can redefine ""wall"" to something else. But wait, can I move the text blocks? The rules say I can only move objects or text that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. The ""is"" text itself isn't stopped, so maybe I can move it.

Alternatively, maybe I can take the ""you"" rule and attach it to another object, making that object me. For example, if I make the ball ""you,"" then I could control the ball instead. But how?

Let me check the current active rules again. The active rules are ""wall is stop,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" The other rules on the map are for ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""win,"" ""ball,"" etc., but they're probably inactive because the active rules take precedence.

So, the key is at 8 right, 2 down. The path there is blocked by walls at 4 right and 2 down, and other walls below. To get there, I might need to move through the grid, but the walls are stopping me. Unless I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, perhaps I can replace it with something else. For example, if I move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and change ""stop"" to another property, like ""push"" or remove the rule entirely. But how to do that?

Looking at the map, the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up from the current position. The ""is"" block is there. If I can move both ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks to a different location, maybe I can create a new rule. For instance, moving ""wall"" next to another object and changing its property.

Alternatively, maybe I can take the ""you"" rule and attach it to the key, making the key ""you,"" but the key is the win condition. If I become the key, then stepping on it would make me win. But how to do that?

Wait, the key is at 8 right, 2 down. If I can move the ""you"" rule to the key's location, then the key becomes ""you."" Let's see. The ""you"" rule is currently at 1 step right and 3 steps down (from the previous observation), but in the current observation, it's at 1 step right and 1 step down. So the ""you"" rule is adjacent to the ""baba"" rule. 

If I can move the ""you"" rule to the key's position, that would make the key ""you."" Then, since I'm Baba (""baba is you""), I could move to the key and win. But how to move the ""you"" rule there?

To move the ""you"" rule, I need to be able to move text blocks. Since the active rules don't restrict moving ""is"" or ""you"" blocks (they are part of the rules but not defined as stop), I can probably push them. So, I need to navigate to the ""you"" rule, which is 1 step right and 1 step down from my current position (since I'm at ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down""). 

Wait, my position is at ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" relative to the wall at 4 steps right. So, if the wall is at 4 right, then my position is 4 right minus 1 left, which is 3 right, and 1 step down from the wall's position. But I'm not sure about the exact coordinates. Maybe I should focus on relative movements.

From my current position, to reach the ""you"" rule (which is 1 step right and 1 step down from the ""baba"" rule), I need to move right and down. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So moving down from my current position might hit that wall. Wait, no—the walls are at specific positions. Let me check the objects again.

In the current observation, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, 4 right and 2 step up, etc. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the ""baba"" rule. So if my position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 1 step down from the wall at 4 right, then moving right would take me towards the wall at 4 right. But the wall is at 4 right, so if I move right from my current position (which is left of 4 right), moving right would approach that wall. However, the active rule says ""wall is stop,"" so I can't move into it.

Wait, maybe the exact positions are as follows:

Assuming the wall at 4 right is a vertical wall blocking movement to the right beyond that point. So if I'm to the left of 4 right, moving right would take me closer, but I can't pass through the wall. So to reach the ""you"" rule, which is 1 step right and 1 step down from ""baba,"" I need to move in that direction, but there might be walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule block to the key's location. To do that, I need to push the ""you"" rule to the right and down. But how?

First, I need to get to the ""you"" rule. From my current position (near the ""baba"" rule), moving right and down. Let's see: the ""you"" rule is 1 step right and 1 step down from ""baba."" So if I move right once, then down once, I reach the ""you"" rule. But is there a wall in the way?

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. If I'm at position 3 right (since ""baba"" is 1 step left from 4 right), moving right to 4 right would hit the wall at 4 right and 1 step up, but that's up, not down. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged in a grid. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the available text blocks and how to manipulate them.

The key is at 8 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move past several walls. The walls are at 4 right in various steps up and down. The only way past them is to either move around them (but that's blocked) or change the ""wall is stop"" rule so walls don't block movement.

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can make myself ""key"" by creating a new rule ""baba is key."" To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""key."" But where is the ""key"" rule? The active rule says ""key is win,"" but there's a text block ""rule `key`"" at 7 steps right and 2 step up. So if I can move the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is,"" then create ""baba is key.""

But how to do that? Let's see. The current ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 3 steps down (wait, in the previous observation, but now in the current observation, it's at 1 step left and 1 step down). The ""is"" block is at 1 step down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right and 2 up. So to create ""baba is key,"" I need to move the ""key"" block next to the ""baba"" and ""is"" blocks.

The distance between ""baba"" and ""key"" is quite large. There's a wall at 4 right, so moving right from ""baba"" would hit the wall. Alternatively, maybe moving down towards the key. But the key is at 8 right and 2 down. From the current position (baba at 1 left from 4 right, so 3 right), moving right would get to 4 right, which is a wall. So that's blocked.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: Make the wall not stop. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and change the property.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left and 4 step up. The ""is"" block is there. If I can move the ""wall"" text block and the ""is"" block next to a different property, like removing ""stop"" or changing it to another word. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" text block away, then the rule becomes ""wall is"" (incomplete), which might make walls not stop. But incomplete rules might not work.

Alternatively, replace ""stop"" with another property. For instance, if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and then add ""push"" instead of ""stop,"" creating ""wall is push."" Then walls would push me instead of stopping, allowing me to move around them.

But how to do that? The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step right and 2 step up relative to the ""wall is stop"" rule. Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule's position is 1 step left and 4 step up from the wall at 4 right. The ""is"" block is there, and the ""stop"" block is 1 step right and 2 step up from that. So to replace ""stop"" with another word, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and then place another word like ""push"" there.

But the ""push"" text block isn't present on the map. The available text blocks are ""wall,"" ""is,"" ""stop,"" ""key,"" ""win,"" ""ball,"" and ""you."" So I have to use existing ones. Maybe rearrange to form ""wall is you,"" making walls be me, so I can move through them. But ""baba is you"" already, so if walls are also you, then I can move through them.

But how to create ""wall is you."" The ""you"" text block is at 1 step right and 1 step down from ""baba."" So if I can move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and then move the ""you"" block next to it, creating ""wall is you.""

The steps would be:

1. Move from current position to the ""wall is stop"" rule area.
2. Move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" to the left or right.
3. Move the ""you"" block to the position after ""is,"" forming ""wall is you.""

But navigating there might be tricky due to walls. Let's see. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 left and 1 down from the wall at 4 right. To get to the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is 1 left and 4 up from that wall, I need to move up four steps, left one step. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 right and 2 up, there's a wall. So moving up from my current position (3 right, 1 down from the wall at 4 right) would go through positions that might have walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. This is getting complicated. Let's think again.

The key is at 8 right, 2 down. To reach it, I need to avoid the walls at 4 right. If I can make the wall not stop, I could move through it. Alternatively, become the key to win by stepping on it.

To become the key, I need to create a rule ""baba is key."" To do that, I need to move the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is."" The ""key"" block is at 7 right and 2 up. That's quite far from my current position. There's a wall at 4 right, so moving right isn't possible. Maybe moving down towards the key?

Alternatively, find a way to push the key block closer. But how? If I can make the key ""push,"" then maybe I can push it. But first, need to change its rule.

Alternatively, use the ball. There's a ball at 7 right and 4 down. If I can make the ball ""win,"" then touching the ball would make me win. But how?

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win."" If I can change that to ""ball is win,"" then the ball becomes the win object. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from the key to the ball.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 step up. The ball is at 7 right and 4 down. The distance is significant. Maybe not feasible.

Another approach: Use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can reach the key, which is the win object, then touching it would win. But the path is blocked by walls. So unless I can move the walls or remove their ""stop"" property.

Back to the original idea: Changing ""wall is stop"" to something else. Let's focus on that.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall,"" ""is,"" and ""stop."" These are arranged horizontally or vertically? In the previous observations, the rules are probably in the format [Subject] IS [Property], so each rule has three blocks in a line.

For example, ""wall is stop"" would have ""wall"" followed by ""is"" followed by ""stop."" So to change this rule, I need to rearrange these blocks.

If I can move the ""is"" block between ""wall"" and another property, say ""push,"" then the rule becomes ""wall is push."" But there's no ""push"" block on the map. The available blocks are ""ball,"" ""key,"" ""win,"" ""you,"" etc. So perhaps replace ""stop"" with ""you,"" making ""wall is you."" Then walls would be considered ""you,"" meaning I can move through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""wall"" and then replace ""stop"" with ""you."" The ""you"" block is currently at 1 step right and 1 step down from ""baba."" So the steps would be:

1. Move down from the current position to reach the ""you"" block.
2. Move the ""you"" block to the position after ""is"" in the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. This would create ""wall is you,"" making walls passable.

But how to navigate there? Let's outline the possible moves.

Current position: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down from wall at 4 right.

To get to the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is 1 left and 4 up from the wall at 4 right:

- Move up 4 steps and left 1 step. But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 4 right and 2 up, there's a wall. So moving up from my current position (3 right, 1 down from wall) would take me through positions 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 3 up; etc., but there's a wall at 4 right and 2 up, which is to the right of my path. Maybe not a direct block.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. If I move right first, but I can't because there's a wall at 4 right. So moving right is blocked. So I have to move up and left.

But how to get past the walls? If I can make walls passable by changing their rule, that's the key. So focusing on changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you.""

To do that, I need to access the ""wall is stop"" rule's components. The ""wall"" block is at 1 left and 4 up from the wall at 4 right. The ""is"" block is there, and the ""stop"" block is 1 step right and 2 step up from the ""is"" block.

So the current arrangement is:

wall [1 left, 4 up] – is [same as wall's position?] – stop [1 right, 2 up from is].

To rearrange, I need to move the ""is"" block and the ""stop"" block.

For example, move the ""is"" block to be between ""wall"" and ""you."" The ""you"" block is at 1 right and 1 down from ""baba,"" which is at 3 right, 1 down (relative to the wall at 4 right). So the ""you"" block is at 4 right, 0 down (since ""baba"" is 1 left from 4 right, so 3 right, and ""you"" is 1 right from ""baba,"" making it 4 right, same as the wall's x-coordinate, but 1 down from ""baba's"" position, which was 1 down from the wall at 4 right. So the ""you"" block is at 4 right, 1 down.

To move the ""you"" block to the ""stop"" position in the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to push it left and up. But there are walls blocking the path.

This is getting really complex. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think step by step.

Alternative Idea: Instead of changing all the rules, maybe use the existing rules to manipulate objects. Since ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that are not ""stop."" But","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is usually to get to the key or the win object, but the rules say key is win right now, so maybe grabbing the key makes me win? Not sure. Let me look at the current setup.

First, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and walls block me. The key is the win condition. The map layout is a bit complex with walls arranged in a grid. Let me visualize the positions.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down. That must be me. To the right and down from there are walls. The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, and there's a ball at 7 right and 2 down. Also, there's a wall at 4 right and 2 down. 

Wait, the key is win, so if I can reach it, I win. But the path might be blocked. The walls are all 4 steps right in various directions. Let me see. If I'm at 1 left and 1 down from the rule baba's position, maybe my actual position is somewhere. Let's assume the rule baba is at (0,0) for simplicity, then 1 step left would be (-1,0), but maybe the coordinates are relative. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of movement steps.

Looking at the objects again, the key is 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down from where the `baba` rule is. If the `baba` rule is 1 step left and 1 down from some point, perhaps the actual position of Baba is that location. Let's say the `baba` rule is at position (x, y), then Baba is at (x -1, y -1). The walls are all at 4 steps right from various positions. 

To reach the key at 8 right and 2 down, but there's a wall at 4 right and 2 down. So maybe I need to move around that. Let me see. If I go down from my current position, can I avoid the walls? Alternatively, maybe I can move right past the walls by manipulating the rules. Wait, the rules are on the map. For example, the rule `wall` 1 step left and 2 step up is part of the active rules. But since the rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"", maybe I can move those text blocks to change the rules.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The other rules on the map are like rule `wall` at certain positions, which I think are separate. To change a rule, I need to move an ""is"" text block next to a subject and property. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block to make ""baba is win"" or ""key is you"", that might change things.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` 1 step down. The `you` rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So, if I can move the `is` block next to Baba and Win, I could make ""baba is win"". Alternatively, moving the `is` next to key and you to make ""key is you"", which might let me push the key or something.

But first, I need to get to those `is` blocks. My position is 1 step left and 1 down from the `baba` rule. Let's say the `baba` rule is at (0,0), so I'm at (-1, -1). The `is` block that's 1 step down is at (0, -1). Wait, no. The `is` block's position is relative to where? The description says ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"" which would place the baba rule at a certain coordinate. Maybe all positions are relative to a central point. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the closest movable objects. The walls are all marked as stop, so I can't move them. The key and ball are objects, but they might not be movable unless their rules are changed. The rules on the map that are not part of the active rules (like the wall, stop, key, win rules) can be moved if they aren't stopped. For example, the rule `ball` 2 steps to the right is a text block that says ""ball"", which is not a stop, so I can move it.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The other rules on the map are separate text blocks. So, for example, the rule `wall` at 1 step left and 2 step up is a text block that says ""wall"", which is part of the active rule ""wall is stop"". But if I can move that ""wall"" text block elsewhere, maybe I can delete the rule ""wall is stop"". But I need to do that by moving the ""is"" next to it.

Alternatively, to create a new rule, I need to have a subject, an ""is"" block, and a property. So, if I can get the ""is"" block next to, say, Baba and Win, that would make ""baba is win"", making me win. Let's see where the ""is"" blocks are.

In the current observation, there's a rule `is` at 1 step down (from the `baba` rule's position) and another `is` at 3 steps down (from the `baba` rule's position). Also, there are `is` blocks at 2 step up, 3 step up, etc., depending on where the rules are placed.

Wait, the objects list includes:

- rule `is` 2 step up
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `is` 3 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step down
- rule `is` 2 steps down
- etc.

So, multiple `is` blocks are scattered around. The key is at 8 right and 2 down, and there's an `is` block at 8 right and 2 up. Hmm.

To make a new rule, I need to move an `is` block next to a subject and a property. For example, if I can move the `is` at 8 right and 2 up next to the key and win, that would make ""key is win"", but that's already the case. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the `is` block at 1 step down from the `baba` rule. If I can move that `is` block next to Baba and Win, that would create ""baba is win"". Let's see where that `is` is. The `baba` rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down (from the initial observation?), but in the current observation, the `baba` rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So the `is` block is 1 step down from there, which would place it 1 step further down.

If I can move that `is` block to be adjacent to Baba and Win, then I can make the new rule. But how do I get there? My current position is relative to the `baba` rule. Let's assume I'm at the position of the `baba` entity, which is defined by the rule `baba` 1 step left and 3 steps down (in previous observations?), but in the latest observation, it's 1 step left and 1 step down. So maybe the coordinates are shifting as I move.

This is getting a bit too vague. Let's try to focus on possible moves. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So I'm movable, walls block movement. The key is at 8 right and 2 down, but there's a wall at 4 right and 2 down. So the path direct is blocked. Maybe I can move around the wall by going left or right, but there are walls on the sides too.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the 'key is win' rule to something else. For example, make 'key is you', so if I touch the key, I become you, but I'm already you. Not sure. Or make 'baba is win', so just being Baba makes me win.

To make 'baba is win', I need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win' text blocks. Looking at the objects, there's a 'win' rule at 9 steps right and 4 step up, but that's part of the active rules. The 'win' text block is probably not movable since it's part of the active rule. Alternatively, the 'win' rule is at 9 right and 4 up, which is far away. 

Alternatively, there's a 'win' rule at 9 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move the 'is' block next to that 'win' and 'baba', but 'baba' is at 1 left and 1 down. The distance is quite far. Maybe not feasible.

Another approach: The ball is at 7 right and 2 down. If I can change the rule to 'ball is you', then maybe I can move the ball to the key. But the ball is an object, and if I can make it 'you', then I could push it. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make 'key is you', then touching the key would make me you, but I'm already you. Not helpful.

Wait, the active rules are 'baba is you', so I'm already you. So if I can reach the key, which is a win object, that should win the level. But the path is blocked by a wall at 4 right and 2 down. So I need to move that wall or find a way around.

But walls are 'stop', meaning they can't be moved unless their rule is changed. To change the rule 'wall is stop', I need to move the 'is' block next to 'wall' and another property. For example, make 'wall is push' or 'wall is you', but that would require moving the 'is' block adjacent to the 'wall' text block and the new property.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'wall' rule at 1 step left and 4 step up, and another at 4 steps right and 4 step up, etc. The 'is' blocks are scattered. For instance, there's an 'is' block at 2 step up, 8 right and 2 up, etc. 

If I can get to the 'wall' rule at 1 left and 4 up and move the 'is' block next to it to change the property, but that's a long way. Alternatively, there's a 'wall' rule at 4 steps right and 2 step up, which is near the key. If I can change that 'wall' to something else, but I need the 'is' block next to it.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to move towards the key while avoiding walls. Let's see my current position. If I'm at the 'baba' rule's position (1 left and 1 down), then moving down would take me towards the key's location. But looking at the obstacles, moving down might hit a wall at 4 right and 2 down. Wait, the walls are all at 4 right in different directions. Maybe I need to adjust my path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left or right around the walls. Let's see. If I move left from my current position, am I blocked? The walls are at 4 steps right, so moving left might be possible. But I need to check the map layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to the right and down, but there's a wall in the way. So maybe I need to go around the wall by moving left or right first. For example, move left to avoid the wall at 4 right and 2 down, then down. But I'm not sure about the exact positions.

Another angle: The 'key is win' rule means that if I can make myself a key, then I win. To do that, I need to create a rule 'baba is key'. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key'. The 'key' rule is at 7 right and 4 down. That's quite far, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, there's a 'key' rule at 7 right and 2 up. If I can move the 'is' block next to that 'key' and 'baba', but again, distance is an issue.

This is tricky. Let me think about possible moves step by step. The last action was 'down', which might have moved me closer. Now, in the current observation, after moving down, where am I? If I was at the 'baba' rule's position (1 left, 1 down), moving down would take me to 1 left, 2 down. Are there any walls there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 right and 2 down. So if I'm at 1 left, 2 down, moving right towards the key would hit the wall at 4 right. So I need to find another path.

Maybe moving left from my current position (1 left, 2 down) to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are all at 4 right, so left of that is clear. Then, from there, move down further. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move right past the wall by pushing it, but walls are 'stop', so I can't. Unless I change the rule for 'wall' to something else. For example, if I can make 'wall is push', then I could push it out of the way. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to the 'wall' rule and change its property.

Looking at the 'wall' rules, one is at 1 left and 4 up. The 'is' block is at 4 up. If I can move that 'is' block next to the 'wall' rule and a 'push' property, but there's no 'push' rule present. I would need to create a 'push' text block, but I don't see one on the map. So that's not possible.

Another idea: Use the ball to break through. If the ball can be made 'stop', then placing it in front of the wall might block it, but that doesn't help me. Or if the ball is 'you', I could move it, but that requires changing rules.

Wait, there's a 'ball' rule at 2 steps to the right. If I can make 'ball is you', then I could move the ball. Let's see. The 'is' block at 1 step down is near the 'baba' rule. If I can move that 'is' block to be next to 'ball' and 'you', that would make 'ball is you'. Then, I could move the ball to block the wall or something. But how to get to that 'is' block?

My current position is 1 left, 2 down. The 'is' block at 1 step down is at the same level as my current position. So if I move right, can I reach it? From 1 left, 2 down, moving right 2 steps would get me to the 'ball' rule's position (2 right), but there's a 'ball' there. Wait, the 'ball' rule is at 2 steps to the right, which is separate from the ball object. The ball object is at 7 right and 4 down. 

Alternatively, moving right from my current position (1 left, 2 down) would take me to neutral, then to right. But there's a wall at 4 right, so moving right towards 4 right would hit the wall. Maybe I need to move up or down first.

This is really confusing. Maybe I should try moving in a direction that gets me closer to an 'is' block so I can change a rule. For example, moving right towards the 'is' block at 8 right and 2 up. But that's a long way. Alternatively, moving down to reach the 'is' block at 2 steps down.

Alternatively, the 'is' block at 1 step down is adjacent to my current position (if I'm at 1 left, 1 down initially, then moving down to 1 left, 2 down, and the 'is' is at 1 step down from the 'baba' rule, which is now at 1 left, 2 down). So maybe the 'is' block is at 1 left, 3 down. If I move down from my current position (1 left, 2 down) to 1 left, 3 down, I'd be at the 'is' block's position. Then, I can move that 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win' to create the rule 'baba is win'.

But how do I know where 'win' is? The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's far away. Alternatively, there's a 'win' rule at 9 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move the 'is' block I'm holding (after moving to it) to be next to 'baba' and 'win', that would work. But the distance is too great.

Wait, maybe the 'win' rule is part of the active rules, so it's always there. But to create a new rule, I need to have text blocks on the map. The active rules are separate from the text blocks. So perhaps the 'win' text block is at 9 right and 4 up, which is far from where I am.

This seems impossible. Maybe I need to think of another way. Since the key is win, perhaps I can make a rule that says 'baba is key', which would make me the key and thus win. To do that, I need to create the rule 'baba is key'. The 'key' rule is at 7 right and 4 down. So I need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'key'.

Assuming I can reach the 'key' rule, which is at 7 right and 4 down, and have an 'is' block nearby, I could do that. But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' blocks. There's an 'is' block at 8 right and 2 up, near the key. If I can move that 'is' block to be next to 'baba' and 'key', that would work. But how to get there?

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by looking at the current observation. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is to reach the key because key is win, but I need to get past the walls which are stop.

First, I need to locate the player, which is Baba. The objects on the map show that there's a rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So, Baba is positioned there. The key is at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. There are walls all along the right side, making it look like a barrier. The ball is at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down, same as the key but one step left.

The problem is that the path to the key is blocked by walls. Since wall is stop, I can't move through them. But how can I manipulate the rules to bypass them? Let me check the available text blocks. There's a rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that around. Also, there are `is` blocks that can be used to create new rules.

If I can change the rule for wall, maybe making it not a stop. For example, if I can make wall equal to something else or remove the stop property. But how? The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. To change wall's property, I need to either move the existing ""wall is stop"" rule or create a new rule that overrides it.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 2 step up. Maybe I can move that `stop` text block to create a new rule. If I can say ""stop is ..."", perhaps stop is something that doesn't block movement. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", but I have to see if that's possible.

Wait, the walls are all the way to the right. If I can make the walls passable, like changing their rule, then I could walk through them. But how? Let me think. The key is win, so maybe I need to make key into a stop or something else. But the goal is to get the key, so that's not helpful. Alternatively, make ""you"" equal to key so that touching the key makes me win. But the current rule is baba is you, so if I can change that to key is you, then I could just stand on the key. However, to do that, I need to move the existing ""baba is you"" rule and replace it with ""key is you"". But I have to check if those text blocks are movable.

The rule ""baba is you"" is located 1 step to the left and 3 steps down, and the ""is"" block is there too. To create a new rule ""key is you"", I would need to bring the ""key"" text block, the ""is"" block, and the ""you"" block together. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 2 step up, the ""is"" is at 8 steps to the right and 2 step up, and the ""you"" is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down. So, maybe I can move the ""you"" rule down to be near the key and ""is"".

Alternatively, maybe I can make the wall into a pushable object. If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then I could move walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to move the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up, and the ""is"" is there. So, if I move the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks to another position, I can replace them with ""wall is push"". But I need to see if that's possible without being stopped by walls. Since the player is near the lower part, maybe moving right isn't blocked yet.

Another angle: the ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, same as the key. If I can push the ball, maybe it can block a wall or create a path. But balls might be stop if there's a rule, but I don't see a rule for ball except ""rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 2 step up"". So perhaps ball is not stop. If I can move the ball into a wall's position, maybe that would remove the wall? Not sure. Alternatively, use the ball to reach the key by pushing it out of the way.

Wait, the key is win, so if I can get to it, but it's blocked by walls. Maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make the walls passable. Let's recap the current rules:

- wall is stop: Any wall blocks movement.
- key is win: Touching the key wins.
- baba is you: The player is Baba.

So, to reach the key, I need to move past the walls. The walls are all along the right side from step up 4 down to step down 2. The path to the key is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and various down positions.

Possible solutions:

1. Change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"". Then, I can move the walls out of the way.
2. Change ""baba is you"" to ""key is you"", making the key the player, so standing on it wins.
3. Use the ball to block a wall or create a path.
4. Create a new rule that allows moving through walls, like ""stop is push"" or ""stop is nothing"".

Let's explore option 2 first. To make ""key is you"", I need to have the key, is, and you blocks together. The key is at 7 right, 2 up. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up. The ""you"" is at 1 right, 3 down. So, moving the ""you"" block down to near the key and ""is"". The player is at 1 left, 1 down. So, the player needs to move right to get to the key area.

But moving right towards the key is blocked by walls. For example, from the player's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right would take them to the grid where walls are. Wait, the walls on the right are at 4 steps right. So the player is at 1 left, 1 down. To move right, they need to go towards 4 right, but there are walls there. So maybe the player needs to move in another direction first.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move up or down. Let's check the layout. The player is at rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"" in the current observation. Wait, no, looking back at the latest observation, the rule `baba` is located at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So the player's position is there.

So, player is at 1 left, 1 down. The walls to the right are at 4 steps right, various positions. To get to the key at 8 right, 2 down, the player would have to move right 7 steps, but that's blocked by walls.

Hmm. Maybe the player needs to move up first. From 1 left, 1 down, moving up would take them towards the wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up. But there's a rule `wall` 1 left and 4 up, and the wall at 4 right and 4 up. So maybe moving up isn't helpful.

Alternatively, moving down. From 1 left, 1 down, moving down would take them to 1 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 right and 2 steps down. So moving down from the player's position would go to 1 left, 2 down, which is not a wall. Then, maybe move rightward from there. But from 1 left, 2 down, moving right would approach the walls at 4 right. Still blocked.

Alternatively, can the player push a wall? If walls are stop, you can't push them. Unless the rule is changed to wall is push. So, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then maybe I can move walls out of the way.

To do that, I need to move the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up, and the ""is"" is at 2 up. So the player needs to move to that area to manipulate the text blocks. But moving there might be difficult because of the walls.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is push"" by placing the text blocks together. The player is at 1 left, 1 down. The ""wall"" text block is at 1 left, 4 up. The ""is"" block is at 4 up. The ""push"" text block isn't present, but maybe there's another rule that can be used. Wait, the active rules are only wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the available text blocks for properties are stop, win, you, is, etc. To create ""wall is push"", I need a ""push"" text block, but I don't see one on the map. Unless ""push"" is derived from another rule, which I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe make ""stop is push"". If walls are stop, and stop is push, then walls would effectively be push. But how to create that rule. The existing ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 2 up. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block and the ""is"" block to create ""stop is push"".

But the player doesn't have a ""push"" block. The available rules are wall, is, stop, key, you, ball. So unless there's a way to use existing blocks to form ""push"", which I don't think so. Therefore, maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Back to option 2: making ""key is you"". The key is at 7 right, 2 up. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 2 up. The ""you"" is at 1 right, 3 down. So the player needs to move the ""you"" block to be next to the key and ""is"". To do that, the player has to navigate to that area. From their current position (1 left, 1 down), they need to move right, but the path is blocked by walls at 4 right. So perhaps moving around the walls by going up or down.

Alternatively, can the player move the ""you"" block? Since ""you"" is a property, and the player is Baba who is you, maybe the player can move any text blocks that are not stop. The walls are stop, so any text blocks on a stop object can't be moved. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 right and 3 down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 3 down, which is not on a wall. So the player can move the ""you"" block.

So the plan could be:

1. Move down from the player's position (1 left, 1 down) to 1 left, 2 down. Is that possible? There's no wall there as per the objects listed. Then move right to 2 left, 2 down. Continue moving right until reaching the area where the ""you"" rule is at 1 right, 3 down. Wait, but moving from 1 left, 1 down to 1 right, 3 down would involve moving right and down. But need to check the path.

Alternatively, the player needs to move to the position of the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down from where? Looking at the observation, the rule `you` is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down from the rule `baba` which is at 1 left and 3 steps down. Wait, the rule `baba` is located at 1 step to the left and 1 step down in the current observation. So the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down from the player's position. So player needs to move right once and down three steps.

But the player is at 1 left, 1 down. Moving right once would take them to their own position (since left and right are relative). Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba. So ""1 step to the left"" means from Baba's position, move left. So the player's current position is the reference point.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to map out the positions.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- The rule `baba` is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So that would be at (-1, -1).
- The wall at 4 steps to the right and 2 step up would be at (4, 2).
- The key is at (8, 2).
- The ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right and 3 steps down from Baba's position, so (1, -3).

So the player needs to get to (1, -3) to move the ""you"" block. But the path there is blocked by walls. From (0,0) (Baba's position), moving right to (1,0), then down to (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3). But are there walls along this path?

Looking at the objects:

- There's a wall at 4 steps to the right and various positions, but those are far to the right.
- The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down is at (4, -1). So moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) is possible, no wall there.
- Then moving down to (1,-1): is there a wall? The objects list walls at 4 right and 1 down, which is far away. So no wall at (1,-1).
- Continue down to (1,-2): no wall mentioned there.
- Then to (1,-3): that's where the ""you"" rule is. So the player can move there.

Once at (1,-3), the player can pick up the ""you"" block and move it. Then, go to the key area (8,2) and create the rule ""key is you"".

But how to get from (1,-3) to the key area? The path is blocked by walls at (4, y) for various y. So even if the player changes the rules, they need to reach the key.

Alternatively, after making ""key is you"", the player can stand on the key to win. But to do that, they need to get to the key's position (8,2), which is blocked by walls. Unless the walls are no longer stop.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach.

What if the player creates a new rule that allows them to move through walls? For example, ""stop is nothing"". To do that, they need to move the existing ""stop is ..."" rule and replace it.

The existing ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 4 up. The ""is"" block is there. So the player would need to move the ""stop"" and ""is"" blocks to create ""stop is nothing"". But ""nothing"" isn't a text block on the map. The available text blocks are wall, key, is, you, ball. So maybe ""stop is ball"" or something else. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, create ""stop is push"". If walls are push, then the player can move them. But again, need the ""push"" text block.

Hmm. Another idea: if the player can make ""wall is you"", then they can move the walls because they would be considered as Baba (since you). But the rule is ""baba is you"", so if you change ""wall is you"", then walls would be you, and since you can move, but walls are also stop. Wait, conflicting properties. The last rule defined for an object takes precedence. So if wall is both stop and you, then depending on the order, it might be stop. So that might not work.

Wait, in Baba Is You, when an object has multiple rules, the last one defined applies. For example, if ""wall is stop"" and then ""wall is you"", the wall is you, but since ""stop"" comes first, it might still be stop. Or does the order of the rules matter? I think the order in which the rules are created matters, but in the game, sometimes the last rule for a property overrides. Need to confirm.

Assuming that the last rule for a property takes precedence, if I create ""wall is you"" after ""wall is stop"", then wall would be you. But since the original rule is still there, maybe it's a combination. Not sure. This could be a way to make walls movable if they are you, but they are also stop. It's unclear.

Alternatively, if I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move the text blocks of that rule away, then walls would no longer be stop. So the player can move through them. To do that, the player needs to move the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks from their current positions.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up, and the ""is"" is at 4 up. To move them, the player needs to carry them. Since the player is you, they can move text blocks that are not stop. The ""wall"" rule is on a wall, which is stop. So the player cannot move the ""wall"" rule block while it's on a stop object. Therefore, the player needs to first move the wall so that the ""wall"" rule is not on a stop object.

But the wall at 4 right, 4 up is a stop, and the ""wall"" rule is on that wall. So to move the ""wall"" rule block, the player would need to push the wall. But walls are stop, so they can't be pushed unless the rule is changed. It's a catch-22.

This seems really challenging. Maybe there's another way. Let's look at the ball. The ball is at 7 right, 2 down, same as the key. If the player can make the ball into a win, then touching the ball would win. But the current rule is key is win. To change that, the player would need to move the ""key is win"" rule and create ""ball is win"". But the player is at (0,0), and the ""key","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key in this case. But the rules can change, so maybe I need to manipulate them.

First, looking at the active rules: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall (which stops me). The key is the win condition, so I need to get to it. But the key is located at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Let me check the map layout.

The objects on the map show that there are walls all along the right side, starting from 4 steps right and going down. The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, which is next to a ball. The path to the key seems blocked by walls. So, how can I get past the walls?

Since I can move text blocks to change the rules, maybe I need to redefine some properties. For example, if I can turn a wall into something else, like a STOP property that's not a wall, then I could move over it. Alternatively, maybe changing the key to be a YOU so I can push it, but that might not work. Wait, the key is already win, but maybe I can make it a different property.

Looking at the rules, there's a rule ""key is win"" which is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that text block, I could change what is win. But I need to see if I can move it. The key itself is at 8 steps right and 4 step up, which is a win object. Wait, the rule ""key is win"" is separate from the key object. To move the rule, I need to move the ""key is win"" text block. The position of that rule is 7 steps right and 4 step up. But the key object is at 8 steps right and 4 step up. So, the rule is one step left of the key.

To move the ""key is win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. But I'm currently at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 1 step down from the ""you"" rule. Let me visualize my position.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down relative to the original position? Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". Wait, no, looking at the objects, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. Wait, the exact position is ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". But the initial position might be different. Let me clarify.

Assuming that the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down from some origin point. Or maybe the coordinates are relative to the map. This can get a bit confusing, but perhaps I need to focus on the relative positions of the text blocks and objects.

The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and down positions. Wait, looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps right, and then walls at 4 steps right and 1 step up, 2 step up, 3 step up, 4 step up, etc. So the right side is completely blocked by walls from 4 steps right upwards and downwards. The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, which is beyond those walls. So how do I get there?

Maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to remove the wall property from something else. For example, if I can make a ball a stop, then I could walk over it. But the ball is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down, which is near the key. Alternatively, if I can turn the wall into a different property, like ""stop is you"", then Baba (who is you) could move through stops. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the key by making it a YOU. If I can change the ""key is win"" rule to ""key is you"", then since I'm YOU, I can push the key. But to do that, I need to move the ""key is win"" text block. Where is that rule located? It's at 7 steps right and 4 step up. The key object is at 8 steps right and 4 step up. So the rule is one step left of the key. If I can move that rule, perhaps to the right to attach it to the key, changing its property.

To move the ""key is win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down from the ""you"" rule. Let me see the positions again:

- ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down""
- ""rule `is` 3 steps down""
- ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 3 steps down""

So, the ""baba"" rule is at position: left 1, down 3. The ""is"" is directly below it, 3 steps down. The ""you"" is to the right of the ""is"", 1 step right and 3 steps down. So, the player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" rule. To move, I can go up, right, down, or left. Let's see:

If I move down from the ""baba"" rule's position, where would that place me? The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 3 steps down from the original reference point (maybe the top-left corner?). So moving down from there would take me further down. But the walls are at 4 steps right and various down positions. Maybe there's a path there.

Alternatively, moving right from the ""baba"" rule's position (which is 1 step left of the ""you"" rule) would take me towards the ""you"" rule. But the ""you"" rule is 1 step to the right of the ""is"" rule at 3 steps down. So moving right from the ""baba"" rule would reach the ""you"" rule. But can I move the ""you"" rule? The active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". So, ""baba is you"" is a rule that makes Baba a YOU, which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 step up from the ""wall"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, perhaps to change what is stop. For example, making the wall not a stop, or making something else a stop.

But the walls are everywhere on the right side, so if I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls wouldn't stop me. But to do that, I need to delete or move that rule. However, in Baba Is You, you can only move text blocks that are not defined as STOP. The current rules have ""wall is stop"", so any text block that is part of a STOP rule can't be moved. Wait, no: the objects that are STOP are the walls, not the text blocks. The text blocks can be moved unless they are part of a rule that makes them STOP. For example, if a text block is defined as STOP by a rule, then you can't move it.

In this case, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up. The wall is at 4 steps right and 2 step up. So the ""stop"" rule is a separate text block. Since the active rule is ""wall is stop"", the wall objects are STOP, but the ""stop"" text block itself is not necessarily STOP. Therefore, I should be able to move the ""stop"" text block if I can reach it.

But my current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down. To reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 2 step up, I need to move right three times and up two times. But along the way, are there any walls blocking? Let's see:

From the ""baba"" rule (position: left 1, down 3), moving right would take me towards the ""you"" rule (right 1, down 3). Then right again to the ""is"" rule (right 2, down 3). Then right again to... Wait, the map has walls at 4 steps right. So moving right from the ""baba"" position (which is left 1, down 3) would first go to right 0, then right 1, right 2, etc. But there are walls at 4 steps right and various positions. However, moving horizontally might be possible unless there's a wall in the way.

But according to the objects listed, the walls are at 4 steps right and various positions (up, same level, down). So between me (at left 1, down 3) and the ""stop"" rule (right 1, up 2), the path might be clear. Let me map this out:

1. From ""baba"" rule (left 1, down 3), move right to reach the ""you"" rule (right 1, down 3). That's allowed because there's no wall there.
2. Then move right again to position right 2, down 3. Is there a wall here? Looking at the objects, the walls are at 4 steps right, so right 2 is clear.
3. Move right to right 3, down 3. Also clear.
4. Move right to right 4, down 3. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So I can't move past that.

Ah, so I can't get to the ""stop"" rule at right 1, up 2 because there's a wall at right 4, down 3 blocking the path. So that approach won't work.

Alternative idea: Maybe I can push a wall or a text block out of the way. Since I'm a YOU, can I push objects that are STOP? According to the rules, if an object is STOP, you can't move it, but if you're a YOU, maybe you can push it if the rule allows. Wait, the default is that STOP objects can't be moved, but if there's a rule that changes that, like ""push is you"", then maybe. But in this case, there's no such rule. So I can't push the walls.

Another approach: Change the ""key is win"" rule so that the key is something I can push. For example, make the key a YOU, so I can move it. But to do that, I need to move the ""key is win"" text block. The ""key is win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. The key object is at 8 steps right and 4 step up. So the rule is one step left of the key.

If I can move that rule to the right, attaching it to the key, changing it to ""key is you"", then the key would be a YOU, and since I'm a YOU, I could move it. But how to move that rule?

To move the ""key is win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down. The ""key is win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. That's quite far. I need to find a way to reach that area.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball. The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the ball a WIN, then maybe reaching the ball would be the win condition. But how?

The active rules have ""key is win"". If I can change that to ""ball is win"", then the ball would be the win object. To do that, move the ""key is win"" rule to the ball's position. But again, moving that rule requires getting there, which is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe there's a different way. If I can make the wall not a STOP, then I can walk through it. To do that, I need to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule or change it. But how? The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 4 step up. To move that rule, I need to reach it.

My current position is at the ""baba"" rule. Let's see the path to the ""wall is stop"" rule:

From ""baba"" (left 1, down 3) to ""stop"" rule (right 1, up 2):

- Move right three times (to right 1, down 3) → ""you"" rule.
- Then move right again to right 2, down 3. Clear.
- Right to right 3, down 3. Clear.
- Right to right 4, down 3. There's a wall here (wall 4 steps right and 3 steps down). Can't move past.
- So this path is blocked.

Alternative path: Move up first. From ""baba"" (left 1, down 3), move up to down 2, left 1. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, walls are at 4 steps right and various positions. At left 1, down 2, is there a wall? Not that I see. So moving up to left 1, down 2. Then move right to right 1, down 2. Then up to right 1, down 1. Then right to right 2, down 1. Continue moving right until reaching the ""stop"" rule at right 1, up 2.

But this might be possible. Let's map it out step by step:

1. From ""baba"" (left 1, down 3) → move up to left 1, down 2.
2. Move right to right 1, down 2.
3. Move up to right 1, down 1.
4. Move right to right 2, down 1.
5. Move up to right 2, down 0. (Assuming down 0 is the top row)
6. Move right to right 3, down 0.
7. Move right to right 4, down 0. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and various positions. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right and 1 step up, 2 step up, etc., but not necessarily at 4 steps right and down 0. So maybe it's clear.
8. Continue moving right until reaching the ""stop"" rule at right 1, up 2. But this seems like a long way with many steps, and I might get stuck.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. But considering the walls are at 4 steps right, it's unlikely. This approach might not work.

Alternative idea: Use the ball to create a new rule. The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can make the ball a STOP, then maybe I can push it out of the way. But I need to move the ""stop"" rule to the ball's position. But again, accessing the ""stop"" rule is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""ball"" rule. There's a rule ""rule `ball` 2 steps to the right"". Where is that located? The ""ball"" rule is at 2 steps to the right from the reference point. If I can move that rule, I could create a new ""ball is..."" rule. For example, making the ball ""win"" or ""you"".

But to move the ""ball"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The ""ball"" rule is at 2 steps to the right. My current position is at left 1, down 3. Moving right to reach the ""ball"" rule:

From left 1, down 3:

1. Move right three times (to right 1, down 3) → ""you"" rule.
2. Right to right 2, down 3. Clear.
3. Right to right 3, down 3. Clear.
4. Right to right 4, down 3. Wall here. Can't proceed.

So again, blocked by the wall at right 4, down 3.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. The ball is next to it. What if I make the key a PUSH or something? But I don't have a push rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba a WIN by changing the ""baba is you"" rule to ""baba is win"". If I can do that, then reaching Baba (myself) would be the win condition. To do that, I need to move the ""baba is you"" rule. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that rule to change it to ""baba is win"", that could work.

To move the ""baba is you"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. I'm currently at the same position as the ""baba"" rule, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down. The ""baba is you"" rule is next to it. So if I move right from the ""baba"" rule's position, I can reach the ""is"" rule, then the ""you"" rule. But how to get to the ""baba is you"" rule?

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"". They are positioned as:

- rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down
- rule `is` 3 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step to the right and 3 steps down

So the ""baba"" text block is 1 step left of the ""is"" block, and the ""you"" block is 1 step right of the ""is"" block. So the entire ""baba is you"" rule spans from left 1 to right 1, all at 3 steps down.

To move the ""baba"" part of the rule, I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at the ""baba"" text block's position (left 1, 3 down), I can move it left or right. Moving left would take me further away, but moving right would reach the ""is","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So normally, I should control Baba since he's defined as ""you"". The goal is to get to the key, which is marked as ""win"", so moving the key somewhere else might not be necessary. But sometimes in Baba Is You, changing the rules can be key.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to navigate through the walls. The walls are all lined up 4 steps to the right at various positions, which probably blocks paths. The rule ""wall is stop"" means I can't move into those walls. 

The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, same row as the key but one step left. If I can move the key somewhere else, maybe I can make the ball act as a win. But wait, the current rules have ""key is win"", so the key is already the win object. But maybe if I make ""ball is win"" instead, then reaching the ball would solve the level. How can I do that?

To create a new rule, I need to move the text blocks. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up, formed by ""rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up"". Wait, the exact positions might be important. Let me parse the objects again.

The ""rule `key`"" is at 7 steps right and 4 step up, with ""rule `is`"" at 8 steps right and 4 step up, making ""key is win"" at 9 steps right and 4 step up. Similarly, the ""rule `win`"" is placed there. To change ""key is win"" to something else, I need to move those text blocks. But can I move them? Are they movable?

The rules say that objects or text blocks with ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties can't be moved. Here, ""wall is stop"", so walls can't be moved. But the text blocks for rules—like ""rule `wall`"", ""rule `is`"", etc.—are they movable? Since they aren't defined as stop, I should be able to move them. 

So the plan is: move the existing ""key is win"" rule to create a new rule like ""ball is win"". To do that, I need to reposition the ""win"" text block. Let's see. The current ""key is win"" is formed by ""rule `key`"" at 7 right,4 up, ""rule `is`"" at 8 right,4 up, and ""rule `win`"" at 9 right,4 up. To make ""ball is win"", I need to take the ""win"" text block (at 9 right,4 up) and move it next to ""ball"" (which is at 2 right,2 up). But the distance is quite far. How do I move the ""win"" rule?

Alternatively, maybe I can break the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I move the ""is"" or ""win"" part away, then the rule is deactivated. But then the key might no longer be the win. But the goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key. However, if I can make the ball the win, then reaching the ball would win the level. 

Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" so that just being on the same tile as Baba (which is you) would make him win. Wait, but Baba is already ""you"", so if ""baba is win"", then since you are Baba, you would automatically win. But is that possible?

Looking at the current rules, ""baba is you"" is active. So if I can create a ""baba is win"" rule, then since you are Baba, you would win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to be next to ""baba"". Let's see where ""baba"" is. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 1 left and 3 steps down from the player's position. Wait, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative. The ""rule `baba`"" is 1 step left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe from the starting point. Alternatively, the positions are relative to the map's grid. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of ""baba"" rule. Let me think. The active rules include ""baba is you"", so the player is controlling the Baba entity. The Baba's position is indicated by the ""rule `baba`"" object at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So the player is at that position. To create a ""baba is win"" rule, I need to move the ""win"" text block (currently at 9 right,4 up) next to the ""baba"" rule. 

But moving the ""win"" text block from 9 right,4 up to near the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,3 down would require moving it left and down. However, the distance is quite far. Maybe there's a better way. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules. The ""is"" text blocks are movable. For example, the ""rule `is`"" at 3 steps down is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be created. Let's see. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,3 down, and there's an ""is"" rule at 3 steps down. If I move the ""is"" from 3 steps down to be next to the ""baba"" rule, then connect it to ""win"". 

Wait, the current ""baba is you"" is made by ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"", ""rule `is` 3 steps down"", and ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 3 steps down"". So the ""is"" is in between ""baba"" and ""you"". To change it to ""baba is win"", I need to replace ""you"" with ""win"". But the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. So if I can move the ""you"" rule to a different position and place ""win"" there instead. 

Alternatively, take the ""win"" rule (at 9 right,4 up) and move it near the ""baba"" rule. But that's a long distance. Maybe there's a path to move the ""win"" text block step by step. Let's see the map layout. 

Looking at the objects, there are walls at 4 steps right at various positions, creating a barrier. The player (Baba) is at 1 left,3 down. The ""win"" rule is up high at 9 right,4 up. To get there, I need to navigate around the walls. But moving horizontally to 9 right might be blocked by the walls at 4 right steps. 

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at 8 right,2 down. To reach it, I need to move down from the player's position. The player is at 1 left,3 down. So moving right to reach 4 right steps, but there are walls at 4 right,1 up, 4 right,2 up, etc. Maybe there's a way to go around. 

Wait, the player's position is likely where the ""rule `baba`"" is, which is 1 step left and 3 steps down from somewhere. Assuming the starting point is the center, moving left 1 and down 3 would place the player there. To move right towards the key, but the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. Unless there's a way to remove the wall rules. 

But walls are defined as stop, so unless I can change that rule. The current rules are ""wall is stop"". If I can change that to something else, like ""wall is you"", then walls become passable. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" property from ""wall"" to another object. 

For example, take the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is formed by ""rule `wall` 1 left,2 up"", ""rule `is` 2 up"", and ""rule `stop` 1 right,2 up"". To change this, I could move the ""stop"" text block to another object, say, making ""wall is you"" instead. That would make walls passable, allowing me to move through them. Then I could go around the walls to reach the key. 

But how to do that? Let's break it down. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at positions 1 left,4 up for ""wall"", 4 up for ""is"", and 1 right,4 up for ""stop"". To change this to ""wall is you"", I need to move the ""stop"" text block (at 1 right,4 up) to be next to ""you"". The ""you"" rule is at 1 right,3 down. But the distance is too far. Alternatively, create a new ""wall is you"" rule by placing ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"" together. 

But the player is at 1 left,3 down. To move the ""stop"" block from 1 right,4 up to near the ""you"" rule at 1 right,3 down, the player would need to move down to 4 up to 3 down, which might be possible. Let's see:

First, move down from the player's position (assuming starting at 0,0) to reach the ""is"" rule at 3 steps down. Then, move the ""stop"" block. But this requires navigating through the map. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules. The ""is"" at 3 steps down is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. Maybe rearrange those to create a new rule. 

This is getting complicated. Let me summarize the possible steps:

1. Navigate to the ""win"" rule (key) directly, but blocked by walls.
2. Change the ""key is win"" rule to make ""ball"" the win condition.
3. Make ""baba"" the win by creating ""baba is win"".
4. Alter the ""wall is stop"" rule to allow moving through walls.

Option 3 seems promising. If I can create ""baba is win"", then since I'm controlling Baba, I'd automatically win. To do this, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" rule. 

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,3 down. The ""win"" rule is at 9 right,4 up. Moving the ""win"" block to near ""baba"" would require moving it left and down. But how?

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" at 3 steps down. The current setup is ""baba"" - ""is"" - ""you"". If I can move the ""is"" to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", then ""baba is win"" would be active. 

So, take the ""is"" at 3 steps down and move it next to ""win"". But the ""win"" is far away. Maybe move the ""is"" step by step. 

First, move down from the player's position to the ""is"" at 3 steps down. Then, move left or right to connect ""baba"" with ""win"". 

But the player is at 1 left,3 down. The ""is"" is at 3 steps down. So moving down from the player's position would reach the ""is"". Then, move the ""is"" to the left or right to connect to ""win"". 

Alternatively, take the ""win"" block at 9 right,4 up and move it down to near the ""baba"" rule. This would require moving the ""win"" block left 8 steps and down 1 step. That's a lot, but maybe possible by pushing other blocks. 

Alternatively, use the key. If the key is win, and it's at 8 right,2 down, maybe I can push it somewhere? But keys are usually movable unless stopped. Since walls are stop, but the key isn't tagged as stop, I should be able to move it. If I can move the key to a different location and then change the ""win"" rule to point there, but that might not be necessary. 

Wait, the key is already the win object. So if I can reach the key, I win. The problem is getting past the walls. If I can alter the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the walls become passable. 

To change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", I need to rearrange the text blocks. The current ""wall is stop"" is made by ""rule `wall` 1 left,4 up"", ""rule `is` 4 up"", and ""rule `stop` 1 right,4 up"". To make ""wall is you"", I need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"". 

So, take the ""stop"" text block at 1 right,4 up and move it to 1 right,3 down where the ""you"" rule is. Then, place ""you"" next to ""wall"" and ""is"". 

But moving the ""stop"" block from 1 right,4 up to 1 right,3 down would require moving down and left. The player is at 1 left,3 down. Maybe move right to 1 right,3 down, then move the ""stop"" block there. 

First, move right from the player's position (1 left,3 down) to 1 right,3 down. That would be two steps to the right. But can the player move right? The player is Baba, and walls are stop. The walls are at 4 steps right, so moving right from the player's position (assuming they're at, say, position 0,0) to 1 right would be okay if there's no wall there. Wait, the objects on the map include ""wall 4 steps to the right"", so at 4 right,0 up (assuming the coordinate system). So moving right from the player's position (1 left,3 down) to 2 right,3 down might be possible if there's no wall there. 

But I'm not sure about the exact positions. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map. Let me try to visualize based on the observations. 

The active rules are:

- wall is stop
- key is win

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""rule `baba`"" object, which is 1 left and 3 down from wherever. Let's say the player's starting position is at coordinates (0,0). Then ""rule `baba`"" is at (-1, -3). The ""is"" rule is at (0, -3), and ""you"" is at (1, -3). The walls are at (4, y) for various y. 

The key is at (8, -2), and the ball is at (7, -2). To reach the key, the player needs to move right from (-1, -3) to (8, -2), but the path is blocked by walls at (4, y) from y = -4 up to y = 4. 

So the main obstacle is the wall at x=4. To go around it, the player would need to go above or below. Let's see:

If the player moves up from ( -1, -3) to ( -1, -2 ), then right to (4, -2), but there's a wall at (4, -2). Alternatively, move up to ( -1, -1 ), right to (4, -1), but wall there too. Moving up further to ( -1, 0 ), right to (4,0) which is a wall. This seems blocked. 

Alternatively, move down below the wall. From ( -1, -3 ), move down to ( -1, -4 ), right past the walls at x=4. But are there walls below? At x=4,2 down is a wall, x=4,3 down is a wall, x=4,4 down is a wall. So moving down from ( -1, -3 ) to ( -1, -4 ), then right to x=4, -4, but there's no wall reported there. Maybe that's possible. 

If the player can get past the walls at x=4 by moving below them, then they can reach the key at (8, -2). But how to confirm that there are no walls below x=4. The observation doesn't mention walls below y=-4, so perhaps it's possible. 

Alternatively, change the ""wall is stop"" rule to allow moving through walls. If walls are no longer stop, the player can walk through them. To do that, need to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule into ""wall is [something else]"". 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by three text blocks: rule `wall` at (-3, 1) (assuming relative positions), rule `is` at (0,1), and rule `stop` at (1,1). To change this, move the ""stop"" to another object. For example, make ""wall is you"", which would make walls passable. 

To create ""wall is you"", need to have rule `wall`, rule `is`, and rule `you` connected. The ""you"" rule is at (1, -3). So the plan is:

1. Move from the player's position (-1, -3) to the ""is"" rule at (0, -3).
2. Move the ""is"" rule to connect ""wall"" and ""you"".
3. Take the ""stop"" rule at (1,1) and move","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the key which is set as win, but I need to check the current rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you.

Looking at the map, there are several walls forming a kind of barrier. The player (Baba) is at 1 step left and 1 step down from the rightmost wall. To the right of Baba, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down, so he can't go that way. Above, there's a row of walls from 4 steps right up to 4 steps right and 4 step up. The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down, which is to the right and down from Baba's current position. There's also a ball at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, same as the key's position but one step left.

The problem is moving past the walls. Since wall is stop, anything labeled 'wall' can't be moved through. But maybe I can change the rules to bypass them. Let's see the available text blocks. There's a rule 'ball 2 steps to the right and 2 step up' and some other rules higher up. If I can move the 'ball' text block to create a new rule, maybe I can make something else movable or change a property.

Wait, the key is currently win, so getting to the key would win the level. But how to reach it? The path to the key is blocked by walls. If I can turn a wall into something else, like removing the 'stop' property from it. But to do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'stop' at 1 step right and 2 step up. Maybe I can move that 'stop' rule somewhere else. But to move a text block, it has to not be a stop. Since the player is 'baba is you', and you can move objects unless they are stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But the text blocks like 'wall', 'is', 'stop', 'key', etc., are they movable? The rules say that objects defined as stop can't be moved. So the text blocks that are part of the wall (like the 'stop' rule) might be considered stop themselves? Or are they separate?

Wait, the 'stop' rule is a text block that says 'wall is stop'. So the 'stop' property is applied to walls. The text blocks themselves are objects on the map. So to move a text block, it needs to not be stopped. So if a text block is not defined as stop, I can move it. Let's check which text blocks are stop. The active rule is 'wall is stop', so any object that is a wall is stop. The text blocks themselves aren't walls unless they are part of a rule. For example, the 'is' text block isn't a wall, so it might be movable. But I need to confirm.

In Baba Is You, typically, text blocks that are part of active rules can be moved unless they are part of a STOP rule. So if a text block is not part of a STOP rule, you can move it. So the 'is' blocks, 'you', 'win', etc., are probably movable unless they are stopped. In this case, the only stop rules are walls, so the text blocks should be movable.

So the plan is: find a text block that can be moved to change the rules. For example, if I can move the 'key is win' rule somewhere else, or create a new rule that makes Baba a key or something. Alternatively, change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is not stop' so walls become passable.

Looking at the objects, there's a 'ball' rule at 2 steps right and 2 step up. Maybe I can use that. If I can move the 'ball' rule and combine it with 'is' and 'you' or 'win' to create a new rule. For example, make 'baba is key' so that touching the key makes Baba win. Or make 'baba is win' directly. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is already win, maybe I just need to reach it. But the path is blocked by walls. If I can remove the 'stop' property from the walls. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is located at 1 step right and 2 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then walls would no longer be stop, and I could pass through them.

But to move the 'stop' rule, I need to be able to move the text blocks that form it. The 'stop' rule is a text block that says 'rule stop 1 step to the right and 2 step up'. Wait, the objects listed include 'rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 2 step up'. So that's the position of the 'stop' text block. To move it, I need to push it using another object that isn't stopped. Since the player is Baba, who is 'you', and you can move objects unless they are stop. The 'stop' rule is a text block, but it's not a wall unless it's part of a wall's definition. The active rule is 'wall is stop', so walls are stop, but the 'stop' text block itself is a separate object. So if I can move the 'stop' text block, I can change where the stop property is applied.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'stop' rule text block away from its current position so that walls are no longer stop.
2. Then, navigate through the walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba immune to stop, like 'baba is not stop'. But how?

Looking at the current rules, 'baba is you' is active. If I can create a rule 'baba is not stop', that would allow moving through walls. To do that, I need to find the 'stop' rule and either move it or create a negation.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can push the key towards Baba. But the key is 7 steps right and 2 steps down from the current position. The player is at 1 step left and 1 step down from the rightmost wall (position 4 right). So the player's position is likely at (4 right, 1 down). The key is at (8 right, 2 down). The path between them is blocked by walls at 4 steps right, 1 step down, and 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So moving right directly is blocked.

If walls are stop, can't go through them. So need to move them or find another way. Maybe use the ball? The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down (same as key). If I can move the ball to block a wall, but not sure.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the ball a stop, blocking the path. But the key is there. Hmm.

Wait, the player is at 1 left and 1 down from the rightmost wall. So maybe the player is at position (4 right, 1 down), and the rightmost wall is at 4 right. So to move right, there's a wall at 4 right and 1 down. To move up, there's a wall at 4 right and 2 step up, etc.

If I can remove the 'stop' property from the walls, then moving through them is possible. So the main goal is to move the 'stop' rule away.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up. So its position is relative to where? The player's position or the map's origin? I think it's relative to the map's grid. Assuming the player is at a certain coordinate, but the exact positions might be tricky without seeing the map visually. But based on the descriptions, the 'stop' rule is located in an area that's above the player's current position.

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to push it using another object. The player is Baba, who is you, so can move objects that are not stop. The 'stop' rule itself is a text block. If the 'stop' rule is not stopped, then I can move it. But since the 'stop' rule is part of the 'wall is stop' rule, does that make the 'stop' text block a stop? Or is it separate?

In Baba Is You, the properties are applied based on the rules. So the 'stop' rule makes walls stop. The 'stop' text block itself is just a rule, not a wall. So it should be movable unless there's a rule that says 'rule is stop', which there isn't. So the 'stop' text block can be moved.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' rule text block away. Let's see where it's located. The 'rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 2 step up' is positioned 1 step right and 2 steps up from where? Maybe from the player's current position. If the player is at (4 right, 1 down), then 2 steps up would be (4 right, 3 down). But this is getting complicated without the exact map layout.

Alternatively, focus on the available text blocks. There's a 'ball' rule at 2 steps right and 2 step up. Maybe combine that with 'is' and 'not stop' to create a 'ball is not stop' rule, allowing the ball to be moved, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: if I can make Baba a key, then touching the key would make Baba win. The current rule is 'key is win', so if I change 'baba is you' to 'baba is key', then since key is win, touching it would win. So how to do that? Need to move the 'you' rule and 'key' rule to create 'baba is key'.

The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. The 'key' rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So the 'baba is you' rule is formed by the 'baba' text block, an 'is' text block, and a 'you' text block.

To change 'baba is you' to 'baba is key', I need to move the 'you' text block and replace it with a 'key' text block. But how? The player (Baba) can move text blocks that are not stop. The 'you' text block is part of the 'baba is you' rule, but it's a separate object. If I can push the 'you' text block away and replace it with a 'key' text block, then the new rule would be 'baba is key'.

But to do that, I need to have a 'key' text block available. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `key` at 7 steps right and 4 step up. So the 'key' text block is there. So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'is' text block that's part of the 'baba is you' rule.
2. Move the 'you' text block away.
3. Bring the 'key' text block next to 'baba' and 'is' to form 'baba is key'.

This way, Baba becomes key, and since key is win, touching the key (which is itself) would make the player win.

But how to execute this movement. The player is at 1 step left and 1 step down from the rightmost wall. Let's assume the coordinates are as follows:

- Player (Baba) is at position (4, 1) [right, down].
- The 'baba' rule is 1 step left and 3 steps down from the rightmost wall, so that would be at (4 - 1, 1 + 3) = (3, 4).
- The 'is' rule for 'baba is you' is at 3 steps down, so same x as 'baba' rule, y = 4 + 1 = 5?
This is getting confusing without the exact grid, but maybe focusing on relative movements.

The key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. The player needs to reach there. If walls are stop, can't go through them. So alternative approach: change the rules to make walls passable.

Another idea: use the ball. The ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down, which is where the key is. If I can make the ball a win, then pushing it to Baba would make him win. But the current rule is 'key is win'. To change that, need to move the 'win' rule.

The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that 'win' rule to the ball's location, then the ball becomes win. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule 'ball is win' by moving the 'win' text block to the ball's position. But the player needs to move the 'win' rule there.

But the player is at (4,1), and the 'win' rule is at (9,4) relative to somewhere. Maybe moving right and up is possible if walls are passable.

This is quite complex. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move the 'stop' rule away to remove walls' stop property.
   - The 'stop' rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up from somewhere. Assume it's near the top wall.
   - Need to push the 'stop' text block to a different location using adjacent objects.

2. If successful, walk through the walls to the key.

3. Alternatively, change 'baba is you' to 'baba is key' to win by touching the key.

But to do either, need to manipulate text blocks.

Another angle: the ball is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. The key is there. If I can make the ball pushable, then maybe push it towards Baba. But the ball's rule is 'rule `ball` 2 steps to the right', which probably means the ball's position is fixed unless moved.

Wait, the 'rule `ball` 2 steps to the right' is a text block that says 'ball is at 2 steps right'. So to move the ball, I need to change that rule. To do that, I need to move the 'ball' text block and the 'is' text block associated with it.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'ball is push' to make it movable. But there's no 'push' property in the current rules. So maybe not.

Alternatively, use the existing 'key is win' rule. If I can make the ball a key, then the ball would be win. So create 'ball is key' rule. Then touching the ball (which is a key) would make Baba win. But the ball is already at the key's position. So if I make the ball a key, then both the ball and the key are keys, and since key is win, touching either would work.

To create 'ball is key', need to move the 'key' text block to the ball's position. The 'key' text block is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. So moving it down to 2 steps down (ball's position) would create 'ball is key'.

But how to move the 'key' text block. The player is at (4,1). The 'key' text block is at (7,4) relative to where? If the player is at (4,1), then moving right 3 steps and up 3 steps would reach the 'key' text block. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at (4,1) (player), moving right to (5,1) is blocked by a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up? Not sure.

This is getting too vague without seeing the map. Let's try to think of possible valid actions based on the previous steps where the assistant kept going down. Maybe the correct path is to move down to reach a position where rules can be manipulated.

Looking at the observation, after previous actions of down, the player's position might have changed. Each 'down' action moves them one step down. If they kept moving down, they might be moving towards the area where the 'baba' rule is located, which is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. Maybe by reaching there, they can interact with the text blocks.

Alternatively, the correct action is to move right towards the key, but blocked by walls. So need to change the rules first.

Another approach: since 'baba is you', and you can move objects unless they're stop. The 'is' text blocks are not stop, so they can be moved. The 'baba is you' rule is composed of three text blocks: 'baba', 'is', 'you'. If I can move the 'you' text block away and replace it with a 'win' text block, then the rule becomes 'baba is win', making Baba win by default.

The 'you' text block is at 1 step right and 3 steps down. The 'win' text block is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. To swap them, the player needs to move the 'you' to the 'win' position and vice versa. But the distance is too great due to walls.

Alternatively, move the 'is' text block that's part of 'baba is you' to connect with a 'win' text block. For example, if the 'is' is moved next to 'baba' and 'win', creating 'baba is win'.

But again, movement is blocked by walls.

Given the previous failed attempts and the defaulting to idle, perhaps the correct action is to move in a direction that allows interacting with the text blocks. For example, moving right towards the key area, but need to find a way around.

Wait, the key is at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. The player is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So to get there, need to move right 4 steps and down 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1 step down (wall), and 4 steps right and 2 steps down (wall). So moving right directly is impossible.

Alternative path: move up around the walls. The player is at 4 right, 1 down. Above, there's a wall at 4 right and 2 step up. So moving up from 4 right, 1 down would go to 4 right, 2 up, which is a wall. Can't go there. Maybe move left to 3 right, then up? But the 'baba' rule is at 3 right, 4 down","

9,down,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to get to the key or the win object. Right now, the active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". From the observations, I can see that Baba is positioned at 1 step left and 1 step down from the main structure. The key is located at 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down. There are a bunch of walls everywhere, so movement is restricted.

First, I need to move towards the key. But how? The walls are labeled as 'stop', meaning I can't pass through them. Looking at the map, maybe there's a path by moving down or right. Let me check the position of Baba. The rules mention ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"" initially, but in the current observation, Baba is at 1 step left and 1 step down. Wait, the observation might have changed after some moves. 

I need to find a way to reach the key at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. Currently, Baba is at 1 left and 1 down. To get there, I might need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right in various positions. For example, wall 4 steps right, 1 step up, 2 steps up, etc. So moving straight right might hit a wall. Maybe I need to move down first to avoid the walls. Looking at the current position, if I move down once, I would be at 1 left and 2 down. Are there walls there? The observation shows a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, but that's further away. So maybe moving down is safe. 

Alternatively, moving right step by step, checking if there's a way around. But the walls are densely packed. Wait, there's a rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 2 step up. Maybe the ball can be used somehow? But I'm not sure. The key is win, so getting the key would make it a win condition. But how to reach it without hitting walls. 

Another thought: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can manipulate rules to change what's stop or win. For example, if I can create a rule like ""key is stop"" or ""wall is you"", but I need to move the text blocks. However, the text blocks that are part of existing rules might be immobilized if they are 'stop' or similar. Let me check the objects. The active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""rule `wall` 1 step left and 2 step up"" are separate. To change a rule, I need to move the 'is' text block. For example, if I can take the 'win' from the key and attach it to Baba, making ""baba is win"", then touching the key would make me win. But how to do that? 

The key is at 8 right, 2 down. To get there, I need a path. Let me map the path from Baba's current position (1 left, 1 down) to the key (8 right, 2 down). The difference is 9 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there are walls at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe moving right three times, then down, then right again? Let's see:

Current position: 1 left, 1 down.

If I move right three times, I'd be at 1 left (original) +3 = 2 left, 1 down. Then down to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The observation shows a wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, which is further right. So moving down from 2 left, 1 down to 2 left, 2 down might be possible. Then move right again towards the key. But the wall at 4 steps right is a problem. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, maybe moving down first. From 1 left, 1 down to 1 left, 2 down. Then right. Let's see:

1 left, 2 down. Check if there's a wall. The observation lists walls at 4 steps right in different positions. At 1 step down, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So moving right from 1 left, 2 down towards the key, but the walls at 4 steps right would block that. Hmm. 

Wait, the key is at 8 steps right and 2 down. So from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right 7 times and down 1 time. But the walls are at 4 steps right in multiple positions. Maybe there's a path through the lower part. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the objects:

- The main structure has walls at 4 steps right in steps up, 1 step up, 2 step up, 3 step up, right, 1 step down, 2 steps down, 3 steps down.

- The ball is at 7 right, 2 down.

- The key is at 8 right, 2 down.

So the area from 4 right down to 8 right down has walls except for the ball and key. So to get from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down) to the key (8 right, 2 down), I need to go around the walls. Maybe move down to 2 down, then right past the walls. But how?

If I can move down once to 1 left, 2 down, then check if I can move right. Let's see the walls at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So from 1 left, 2 down, moving right would go towards 2 left, 2 down, then 3 left, etc., but the walls start at 4 right. So moving right past 4 right would hit the wall. Wait, the walls at 4 right are at various positions. For example, wall 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So from Baba's position at 1 left, 2 down, moving right 3 times would get to 2 left, 2 down (3 steps right). Then, can I move further right? The next wall is at 4 right, 2 down. So moving to 3 left, 2 down would be possible, but then to 4 left, 2 down is blocked by the wall. Then, how to proceed? Maybe need to move down again? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules. For instance, if I can create a rule that makes the wall not stop, or makes the key a stop so I can push it. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' text blocks. Let's look at the available rules:

- The existing rules are:

  - rule `wall` 1 step left and 4 step up

  - rule `is` 4 step up

  - rule `stop` 1 step right and 4 step up

  - rule `key` 7 steps right and 4 step up

  - rule `is` 8 steps right and 4 step up

  - rule `win` 9 steps right and 4 step up

  - rule `ball` 2 steps right and 2 step up

So the active rules are formed by combining these. For example, ""wall is stop"" comes from rule `wall` near rule `is` and rule `stop`. To change a rule, I need to move an 'is' between a subject and a property. For example, if I can take the 'win' from the key and attach it to Baba, making ""baba is win"". Then touching the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' that's connected to 'key' to instead connect to 'baba'. 

The 'key' rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up, with an 'is' at 8 steps right and 4 step up, and 'win' at 9 steps right. So the rule is ""key is win"". To change this, I need to move the 'is' between key and win to between baba and win. 

Baba's rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down (from previous observations?), but in the current observation, rule `baba` is 1 step left and 3 steps down, and rule `is` is 3 steps down, rule `you` is 1 step right and 3 steps down. So the current rule is ""baba is you"". To change this to ""baba is win"", I need to move the 'is' from between 'you' and 'baba' to between 'baba' and 'win'. 

But how to move the 'is'? The 'is' at 3 steps down is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. To rewrite that, I need to take the 'is' and place it between 'baba' and 'win'. However, moving text blocks that are part of 'stop' rules might be impossible because they are immobilized. The 'stop' rule is attached to the wall, so those text blocks might be stop, meaning they can't be moved. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'is' that's part of the key rule (at 8 steps right and 4 step up) can be moved. If I can move that 'is' to connect 'baba' and 'win', then ""baba is win"" would become active, making touching the key win the game. 

To do this, I need to navigate to the 'is' block at 8 steps right and 4 step up, then move it to connect with 'baba' and 'win'. But Baba is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and 'win' is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's a long distance. There are walls blocking the way. 

Alternatively, maybe first move down to get closer. From the current position (1 left, 1 down), moving down once gets to 1 left, 2 down. Then right towards the 'is' block at 8 right, 4 up. But that's a big jump over walls. 

This seems complicated. Another approach: since the key is win, maybe just reach it. But the path is blocked. Wait, the key is at 8 right, 2 down. There's a ball at 7 right, 2 down. Maybe pushing the ball out of the way? But how? The ball is a regular object, unless there's a rule that makes it stop. Currently, the only stop is wall. So maybe I can move the ball. 

To push the ball, I need to be next to it and move in the direction. The ball is at 7 right, 2 down. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right 6 times and down 1 time would reach the ball. But the walls at 4 right are in the way. Let's see:

From 1 left, 1 down:

Move right 3 times to 2 left, 1 down.

Move down to 2 left, 2 down.

Move right 4 times to 2 left (2-4= -2?), wait, directions might be relative. Maybe the coordinate system is such that each step is absolute. Wait, the observations mention positions relative to Baba? Or is it a grid where each step is in a direction. 

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving down first to avoid walls. Let's try moving down from the current position.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. The goal is probably to get to the door because it's defined as win now, but I have to check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 7 steps to the right. So maybe I need to get that key first? But the key's position might be blocked. Let me parse the positions again.

The rule `key` is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, the key object itself is at 7 steps to the right. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy in the descriptions. There's also a door at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is the win condition. But I can't move through walls or stops. The wall is stop, so any wall I'm next to blocks movement.

Baba's position is at 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So if I'm Baba, I need to move to the key first, then perhaps use the key to interact with the door. But how does the key work here? Since the key is win, does picking it up make me win? Or do I need to place it on the door?

Wait, the original rules had key is win, but in the current observation, door is win. So the win condition has changed. The key's property is still win, but maybe the door is now the main target. However, the key might be necessary to unlock something else, like the door. But the door's property is win, so maybe reaching it is enough. But how do I get there?

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down, and another at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So the path might be blocked. Let me visualize the map roughly.

Baba is at 2 left, 3 down. The door is at 6 right, 1 down. The key is at 7 right. So to get to the door, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right, 2 up; 3 right, 1 up; 3 right, 1 down; 3 right, 2 down. So the path to the right is blocked by walls except maybe between them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down from Baba's position. Let's see. If I move down once, I'm at 1 left, 4 down. Are there walls there? The wall at 3 right and 3 steps down is far. Not sure. Maybe I can move left from Baba's position. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 left and 3 down. So Baba's current position is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe the reference point is the initial position, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to move towards the key first. The key is at 7 steps to the right. From Baba's position (assuming starting point), moving right 5 times would get there. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So how to navigate around that?

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. Maybe I can go around them by moving up or down. For example, from Baba's position at 2 left, 3 down, moving up might avoid the walls. Let me think step by step.

Baba's position: 2 left, 3 down. Let's consider moving right. First step right would be 1 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 3 right, so maybe not. Then next step right to 0 left, 3 down. Still safe. Then step right to 1 right, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls at 3 right are in different positions. The wall at 3 right and 1 step down is there. So moving to 1 right, 3 down is clear. Then step to 2 right, 3 down. Is there a wall? The wall at 3 right, 3 steps down is there. So can't go past 2 right, 3 down. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe move up from Baba's position. Moving up once to 2 left, 2 down. Then right to 1 left, 2 down. Then right to 0 left, 2 down. Then right to 1 right, 2 down. Then right to 2 right, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 3 right, 2 step up is there. So can't go past 2 right, 2 down. Hmm, stuck again.

Wait, maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules. Since the key is win, if I can make the key part of my identity, maybe I can win by touching it. But the current rule is baba is you. If I can create a rule like ""baba and key is you"", then touching the key would make me you. But to do that, I need to move the 'key' text block and 'is' text block together with 'baba' and 'you' somewhere.

Looking at the objects, the 'key' rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. So perhaps I can move the 'key' block next to 'is' and 'baba' to form a new rule.

But how to move the text blocks? I need to move them without stepping on stop walls. Let's see. The 'key' rule is at 1 right, 2 down. The 'is' rule is at 7 right, 2 down. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 3 down. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down.

If I can move the 'key' block closer to the 'is' block, maybe combine them. But moving the 'key' block requires it to not be stop. Since key is win, but win isn't stop, so maybe it's movable. Wait, the active rules are wall is stop. So any object that's not wall or stop can be moved. Key is win, so it's movable. Similarly, the 'is' text block is movable.

So the plan is: move the 'key' text block next to the 'is' text block, then combine them with 'baba' to create a new rule like ""baba is key"", making Baba be key, and since key is win, touching anything would make you win? Or maybe ""baba is you key"" to add key to your properties.

Alternatively, create ""key is you"", which would make the key the you object, so touching it would make you win. But how to do that.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move Baba to the position of the 'key' text block.
2. Move the 'key' text block to be next to the 'is' text block.
3. Then, combine them with 'baba' to form ""baba is key you"" or similar.

But first, I need to navigate Baba to where the 'key' is. The 'key' is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from where? If Baba is at 2 left, 3 down, then moving down two steps would get to 2 left, 5 down. But the 'key' is at 1 right, 2 down. So relative positions might be different.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of the map grid. Let's assume that the starting point (where the rules are displayed) is the origin (0,0). Then:

- The rule `wall` is 2 step to the left and 2 step up from (0,0). So position (-2, 2).
- The `is` rule is 1 left, 2 up: (-1, 2).
- `stop` is 2 up: (0, 2).
- Wall at 3 right, 2 up: (3, 2).
- `door` is 6 right, 2 up: (6, 2).
- `is` again at 7 right, 2 up: (7, 2).
- `win` at 8 right, 2 up: (8, 2).
- Then walls at 3 right, 1 up: (3,1), 3 right: (3,0), 3 right,1 down: (3,-1), 3 right,2 down: (3,-2).
- Key at 7 right: (7,0).
- Door at 6 right, 1 down: (6,-1).
- `key` rule at 1 right, 2 down: (1,-2).
- Wall at 3 right,3 down: (3,-3).
- Baba's rule is at 2 left,3 down: (-2,-3).
- `is` at 1 left,3 down: (-1,-3).
- `you` at 3 down: (0,-3).
- Walls at 3 right,3 down: (3,-3), 3 right,4 down: (3,-4).

So Baba's position is (-2,-3). The key is at (7,0). The door (win) is at (6,-1). So to get to the door, need to go right past the walls at (3, y). Let's see the path from (-2,-3) to (6,-1).

Possible route: Move right, avoiding walls. Let's see:

From (-2,-3), moving right to (-1,-3), (0,-3), (1,-3). Then down to (1,-4)? But there's a wall at (3,-4). Not sure. Alternatively, move up from (-2,-3) to (-2,-2). Then right to (-1,-2), (0,-2), (1,-2). Then right to (2,-2). Is there a wall there? The wall at (3,2) is up, not here. So (2,-2) is clear. Then right to (3,-2), but there's a wall at (3,-2). Can't go past. So need to go around.

From (2,-2), move up to (2,-1). Is there a wall? At (3,-1), yes. So can't go right. Move down to (2,-3), which is back. Hmm.

Alternatively, from (-2,-3), move up to (-2,-2), right to (0,-2), then up to (0,-1). Then right to (1,-1), (2,-1). Then right to (3,-1), which is a wall. So can't. Then move down to (2,-1) to (2,0). Is there a wall at (3,0)? Yes. So stuck again.

This is getting complicated. Maybe manipulating the rules is a better approach. Since the key is win, if I can make the key part of my identity, then I can win by touching it. To do that, create a rule like ""baba is you key"". To do that, I need to move the 'key' text block next to 'is' and 'baba'.

Baba's rule is at (-2,-3), 'is' is at (-1,-3). The 'key' rule is at (1,-2). So need to move the 'key' block to be next to 'is'.

How to move the 'key' block: from (1,-2) to, say, (0,-2), then to (-1,-2), then to (-2,-2), adjacent to 'is' at (-1,-2). But moving the 'key' block requires stepping on it, right? So I need to push it.

Baba is at (-2,-3). Move up to (-2,-2). Then move right to (-1,-2). Now, the 'key' is at (1,-2). To get there, move right from (-1,-2) to (0,-2), (1,-2). But the 'key' is there. So can I push it? Since key is win, which is not stop, so yes. So step on the 'key' block and move right, which pushes it to (2,-2).

But then 'key' is at (2,-2). Now, adjacent to 'is' at (-1,-2). Hmm, not adjacent. Maybe need to get closer. Alternatively, move 'key' to (-1,-2) by stepping on it and moving left. But from where?

Alternatively, move Baba to (1,-2) by moving right from (-1,-2) to (0,-2), (1,-2). Then step on 'key' and move left, pushing it to (0,-2). Then move left again to (-1,-2), pushing 'key' to (-1,-2). Now, 'key' is next to 'is' at (-1,-3)? Wait, no. 'is' is at (-1,-3), which is down one from (-1,-2). So not adjacent.

This is tricky. Maybe need to move 'is' instead. The 'is' at (-1,-3) can be moved. If I can move 'is' up to (-1,-2), then place 'key' next to it.

So steps:

1. Move Baba from (-2,-3) to (-1,-3) (right), then to (0,-3) (right), then up to (0,-2).
2. Move right to (1,-2), step on 'key' and move right to push it to (2,-2).
3. Move left back to (1,-2), step on 'key' again and move left to (0,-2), then to (-1,-2), pushing 'key' to (-1,-2).
4. Now 'key' is at (-1,-2), next to 'is' which is at (-1,-3). But they're not adjacent vertically. To make them adjacent, need to move 'is' up.

5. Move Baba to (-1,-2), then move down to (-1,-3) (where 'is' is). Step on 'is' and move up to (-1,-2), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move 'is' up by stepping on it and moving up.

Wait, 'is' is at (-1,-3). If I move Baba to (-1,-3), step on 'is', then move up to (-1,-2), which would push 'is' to (-1,-2). Now 'is' is at (-1,-2), and 'key' is at (-1,-2). So they are adjacent. Then, place 'baba' next to them.

Baba is currently at (-1,-2) after moving 'is' up. Move left to (-2,-2), then down to (-2,-3), but that's back. Alternatively, move right to (0,-2). Then, place 'baba' rule next to 'is' and 'key'.

Wait, the original 'baba' rule is at (-2,-3). If I can move that, but 'baba' is you, and you can't move rules that are part of your identity unless you redefine them. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is key you"" by placing 'baba', 'is', 'key', 'you' in sequence.

But to do that, need to move the 'you' rule, which is at (0,-3). Let's see.

Step by step:

1. Move Baba to (0,-3) (the 'you' position).
2. Step on 'you' and move it to, say, (1,-3).
3. Then move back to (-2,-3), move up to (-2,-2), right to (-1,-2), then to (0,-2).
4. Place 'you' at (1,-2), next to 'key' at (-1,-2) and 'is' at (-1,-2).
Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe a better approach is to push the 'key' next to 'is' and then add 'baba' and 'you' to form the new rule.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe touching the key makes me win. But how to reach the key. The key is at (7,0), which is far to the right. There are walls at (3, y) positions blocking the path.

Perhaps I need to move the walls elsewhere by redefining rules. For example, if I can make 'wall' not stop, then I can move through them. But the current rule is 'wall is stop', so if I can break that rule.

To break 'wall is stop', I need to move the 'wall' rule or the 'stop' rule. The 'wall' rule is at (-2,2), and 'stop' is at (0,2). If I can move these rules, I could change their definitions.

For example, move 'stop' to a different position, so that 'wall' is no longer stop. Then walls would be passable. Steps:

1. Move Baba to (0,2) where the 'stop' rule is.
2. Step on 'stop' and move it somewhere else, say, to (1,2).
3. Now, the rule 'wall is stop' remains, but 'stop' is defined elsewhere. Wait, no. The rules are formed by the text blocks. If I move the 'stop' text block, the rule would still be 'wall is stop' because the 'wall' and 'is' are in their positions. So moving the 'stop' block doesn't change the rule; the rule is defined by the positions of 'wall', 'is', and 'stop'.

Wait, the rule 'wall is stop' is formed by the text blocks 'wall' at (-2,2), 'is' at (-1,2), and 'stop' at (0,2). If I move the 'stop' block to (1,2), the rule would still be 'wall is stop' because the 'is' is between 'wall' and 'stop'. So the rule is determined by the order of the text blocks. So to break 'wall is stop', I need to reorder the text blocks so that it's not 'wall is stop' anymore.

For example, move the 'stop' block to after 'is', making the rule 'wall is [something else] stop'. But that's not possible because the rule is parsed as [Subject] IS [Property]. So the third block after 'is' would be the property. So if I have 'wall is stop', moving 'stop' elsewhere would break the rule.

Wait, the rule is formed by three text blocks in sequence: Subject, IS, Property. So 'wall' (Subject) at","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. Let's start by understanding the current situation. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. That means I can move Baba because she's defined as ""you,"" but walls will stop me. The goal is to reach the door, which is now set as ""win.""

Looking at the objects on the map: There's a key at 7 steps to the right. But wait, the original rule was ""key is win,"" but now it's changed to ""door is win."" So the key's purpose might have changed, or maybe it's a red herring. I need to check where the door is located. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Also, there's a rule ""key is win"" placed 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Hmm, that's conflicting because ""door is win"" is a current active rule. Maybe the key's win rule is still there, but since ""door is win"" is active, maybe that's the main objective.

Now, where is Baba located? The rule for Baba is at 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So if I consider my position as the starting point, moving right three steps would get me to the location of the ""baba"" rule. But since I'm Baba (because ""baba is you""), I can move around. Let me try to visualize the map.

The walls are positioned in a way that creates barriers. To reach the door at (6 right, 1 down), I might need to move right past the walls. Let's see the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up, another at 3 right and 1 up, 3 right, 3 right and 1 down, etc. So the path to the door might be blocked by walls unless there's a way around.

Wait, there's a key at 7 steps right. Maybe I need to get the key first? But the door is at 6 right and 1 down. If I can move right past the walls, perhaps I can reach the door. Let me check the positions again. From my current position (assuming I'm at the baba rule's location, 2 left and 3 down), moving right three steps would get me to the same level as the wall at 3 steps right. Then moving down might be possible, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 down. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a block or rearrange the rules. Since ""baba is you,"" I can move text blocks. The ""key is win"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe it can help. But the key itself is at 7 right. Wait, the key's position is separate from the rule. So maybe the key is just an object that's Win if the rule says so, but since door is Win now, the key might not be necessary.

Another approach: The door is at 6 right, 1 down. Let me see the path. From my position (2 left, 3 down), I need to move right 4 steps to get to 2 right, but there's a wall at 3 right. So moving right directly isn't possible. Maybe I can move around the walls. Let's check the layout:

- Looking at the walls: 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; 3 right, 2 down; 3 right, 3 down; 3 right, 4 down. So the walls form a kind of barrier from 3 right up to 4 down. The door is at 6 right, 1 down, which is outside this barrier. The key is at 7 right, which is past the barrier. So maybe I need to move through the barrier by finding a way around.

Wait, the rule ""door is win"" is at 6 right and 2 up. The actual door object is at 6 right and 1 down. So the door is below its rule. To reach the door, I need to get past the walls at 3 right. Let me think about possible movements. If I move right from my position (2 left, 3 down), that's towards the center. Let's say I move right three times: each step right would take me to 1 left, 0 left, then to the starting point (3 right). But there's a wall at 3 right, so I can't go further right. Alternatively, maybe move down past the walls. From my position (3 down), moving down once would be 4 down, but there's a wall there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""door is win"" rule to a different position so that the door's property changes. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The ""door is win"" rule is at 6 right and 2 up. If I can move that rule next to the door object, maybe it would still apply. But the door is at 6 right and 1 down. The rule is two steps up from the door. If I move the rule down two steps, it would align with the door. But how?

To move the rule, I have to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a STOP. The ""door is win"" rule is at 6 right and 2 up. If I can get to that position and move it down. But to get there, I might need to navigate around the walls. Let's see: From my position (2 left, 3 down), moving up would be towards the wall at 4 step up. Maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, move right towards the 3 right position, but there's a wall there. Maybe push the wall? Wait, walls are STOP, so I can't push them. So that's a problem.

Another idea: Since I'm Baba, maybe I can change the ""door is win"" rule to something else. For example, make door a different property, or make myself win. But to do that, I need to move the relevant text blocks. Let's look at the available text blocks. There's a ""rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 2 step up"" which is the ""door is win"" rule. Also, there's a ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"" which is the ""key is win"" rule (but that's probably inactive now).

If I can move the ""door is win"" rule next to the door object, maybe it's already in place. The door is at 6 right and 1 down, and the rule is at 6 right and 2 up. So they're not adjacent. To make the door win, the rule needs to be in a position that applies to the door. The syntax is ""[Subject] IS [Property]"", so the rule should be adjacent to the subject (door) in some way. Maybe the current rule is correctly placed, but since it's ""door is win"", and the door is an object, that should make the door win. But why isn't the player reaching the door winning? Maybe there's a mistake in the rule placement.

Wait, in Baba Is You, the rules are formed by text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". The subject and property can be any objects. So if there's a rule ""door IS win"", then the door becomes win. But the placement of the text block matters. The rule needs to be in a position where it can apply to the door. For example, if the door is located at certain coordinates, the rule should be placed in a way that links to it.

Looking at the current observation, the ""door is win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. The door object is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The distance between them is two steps down. In Baba Is You, the rules typically need to be in the same row or column as the subject to apply. So if the rule is two steps up from the door, it might not be effectively applying. Maybe that's the issue. The rule needs to be placed in a position that's adjacent or in line with the door.

So perhaps the solution is to move the ""door is win"" rule to a position where it's adjacent to the door object. For example, placing it one step down from the door so that it applies. To do that, I need to move the rule block from 6 right, 2 up to 6 right, 1 down (where the door is). But how can I move that rule?

To move the rule, I have to be next to it and not blocked by a STOP. The rule is at 6 right, 2 up. Let's see where I am. My position is rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So converting that to the same coordinate system, if the rule is at 2 left and 3 down from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This part is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are absolute. Let me assume that the player's position is at (0,0), and other objects are positioned relative to that.

If the player (Baba) is at, say, position (2 left, 3 down), which might be (-2, -3) in a coordinate system where the player is at (0,0). Then the ""door is win"" rule is at 6 right and 2 up, which would be (6, 2). The door object is at (6, 1). To move the rule from (6,2) to (6,1), I need to be adjacent to the rule and move it down. But to get to (6,2), I have to navigate from my current position (-2,-3) to (6,2), which is blocked by walls at 3 right and various steps up.

This seems difficult. Maybe there's another approach. What if I make myself (Baba) win instead of the door? The current rule is ""baba is you"", so if I can change that to ""baba is win"", then reaching any part of the map where Baba is would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule or create a new ""baba is win"" rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". That's part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I can separate the ""baba"" from ""is you"", maybe I can rearrange them. For example, move the ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and ""win"". But where is the ""win"" rule? The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 2 up. That's quite far.

Alternatively, use the existing ""rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down"". If I can move the ""you"" part (which is at 1 step right and 3 steps down) next to ""baba"" and ""is"", perhaps creating ""baba is win"". Let's see: The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 3 down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left and 3 down. The ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 3 down. So if I move the ""you"" rule left two steps, it would be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", forming ""baba is you"". But that's the existing rule. To make ""baba is win"", I need to replace ""you"" with ""win"". But there's a ""win"" rule at 8 right and 2 up. How to get that here?

This seems complicated. Maybe another strategy: Use the key. The key is at 7 steps right. If I can get the key and then reach the door, but the door is win. However, the key's current rule is ""key is win"" at 1 right and 2 down, but since ""door is win"" is active, maybe the key's rule is overridden. So retrieving the key might not help.

Wait, the key's rule is ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"". That's separate from the object key at 7 right. So if I can move that ""key is win"" rule to be adjacent to the key object, then picking up the key would make it win. But the key is at 7 right, and the rule is at 1 right and 2 down. That's a distance of 6 steps right and 3 steps up. Not adjacent. So moving that rule next to the key would require significant movement, likely blocked by walls.

Another angle: The walls are all STOP, so I can't push them. But maybe I can use other objects to move through. For example, if I can make a wall not a stop, but the only rule is ""wall is stop"", so that's fixed unless I change it.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So walls are immovable. Therefore, I need to find a path around the walls. Let's look again at the wall positions:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down

So from 3 right, the walls go from 2 up down to 4 down. The door is at 6 right and 1 down, which is outside this wall cluster. The key is at 7 right, also outside. So maybe the path is to go around the right side of the walls. From my position (assuming I'm at the baba rule's location, 2 left and 3 down), moving right three steps gets me to 3 right, but there's a wall there. Can't go further right. What if I move down past the walls? From 3 down, moving down to 4 down is blocked by a wall. So that's no good.

Alternatively, move left? The rule `wall` is 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So if I move left, I might hit a wall. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""baba is you"" rule to a different position to free up movement. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left and 3 down, ""is"" is at 1 left and 3 down, and ""you"" is at 1 right and 3 down. If I can rearrange these to allow movement. For example, move the ""you"" to a different spot so I can move freely. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes moving through walls possible. For example, ""wall is not stop"", but to do that, I need to move the existing ""wall is stop"" rule or create a new one. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. If I can move that rule, I could change it. But to move it, I have to be adjacent and not blocked. The ""stop"" rule is at 4 step up, which is high above, likely blocked by other walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""door is win"" rule down to be next to the door object. Let's try to figure out the coordinates. If the door is at 6 right, 1 down, and the rule is at 6 right, 2 up, moving the rule down one step would place it at 6 right, 1 down, aligning with the door. To do that, I need to be adjacent to the rule and move it down.

Where am I located? The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. Assuming this is relative to the player's position, which is Baba, then the player is at 2 left and 3 down from the rule's position. This is confusing. Maybe it's better to think in absolute terms. Let's assign coordinates where the player starts at (0,0).

Then, the ""rule `baba`"" is at (-2, -3). The ""door is win"" rule is at (6, 2). The door object is at (6,1). The player needs to move from (-2,-3) to (6,1) while avoiding walls at (3, 2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (3,-2), (3,-3), (3,-4).

The path from (-2,-3) to (6,1) is blocked on the right side by the wall at (3, y) for various y. So the player must go around either left or up. Going left is possible, but there's a wall at (1,-3) (since the ""stop"" rule is at (2,-3) maybe?). Wait, the wall positions are:

- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 2 step up from where? This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the key is at 7 steps right. If I can reach the key and then the door, but the door is win. However, the key's rule is ""key is win"" at 1 right and 2 down, which might be inactive because ""door is win"" is present. But maybe picking up the key (if possible) would trigger something. However, since the key is an object, and normally you can't pick it up unless there's a rule allowing it. The default is that you can move objects that are not STOP. But the key's property isn't specified, so it's movable. So maybe I can move the key to a different location, but I'm not sure how that helps.

Another thought: The ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"" might still be active. Even though ""door is win"" is present, maybe the key can be used as a win condition if its rule is applied. So if I can move the ""key is win"" rule next to the key object, then picking up the key would make it win. The key is at 7 right, and the rule is at 1 right and 2 down. To move the rule to the key, I need to move it 6 steps right and 3 steps up. That seems impossible due to walls.

This is really tricky. Maybe I need to change the ""baba is you"" rule to ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to manipulate the existing rules. The ""baba"" rule is at (-2,-3), ""is"" is at (-1,-3), and ""you"" is at (1,-3). If I can","

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, I need to get to the door to win, but I can't go through walls. Where am I located?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So I must be at that position. Let me visualize the map. My position is at (left 2, down 3). Now, where's the door? The door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, relative to which point? Maybe I need to check the coordinates.

The walls are all over the place. Let's see: there's a wall at 3 steps right, 2 steps up; another at 3 right, 1 up; and several others down. The key is at 7 steps right, but I don't need the key anymore since door is win now. But maybe moving the key could help, though I don't see the key's current relevance.

My goal is the door at 6 right, 1 down. Let's figure out the path. From my position (2 left, 3 down), moving right would get me towards the door. But need to avoid walls. Let's check the path:

If I move right once, would that hit a wall? The walls at 3 steps right in various directions. Wait, the wall at 3 right and 2 up is above me, but moving right is horizontal. The wall at 3 steps right is directly to the right of my current position? Or is it 3 steps right from some other point?

This is a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to move right step by step. If I go right once, I'm at 1 step left and 3 down. Then right again to 0 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, but that's further. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the rule `baba` position. Let me try to map this.

Alternatively, perhaps the key was moved before, but in the current state, the key is at 7 steps right. Maybe I can use the key to unlock something, but the door is win now. Hmm.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I can manipulate rules, maybe I can change the door's property. For example, make door is you, so touching it would make me the win. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'door' text block next to 'is' and 'you' or 'win'.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `door` 6 steps right and 2 steps up, and a rule `win` 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the 'door' text block to be next to 'is' and 'you', then door is you, and then I can touch the door to win. But how to move the blocks?

I need to check which objects are movable. The rules that define stop (like walls) or other immovable properties might block movement. The active rules are wall is stop, so any object with 'stop' can't be moved. Let's see: the wall objects are positioned at various steps, but the text blocks like 'wall', 'is', 'stop', etc.,—are those movable?

In Baba Is You, typically, text blocks that are not part of an immutable rule can be moved. For example, if 'stop' is a property of a wall, you can move the 'stop' text block elsewhere. But if 'wall is stop' is a rule, then moving 'stop' might not break the rule unless you also move 'wall' or 'is'.

In this case, the rule is 'wall is stop', so the 'is' is connecting 'wall' and 'stop'. If I can move the 'is' text block, that could break the rule. But 'is' is probably not stopped, unless there's a 'stop' rule affecting it. Let me check the active rules: wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So, 'is' is not stopped, so it's movable.

So the plan is: move the 'door' text block next to 'is' and 'you' to create 'door is you', making the door a you, so touching it would make me win. But where are these text blocks located?

Looking at the objects:

- rule `door` is at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps up.
- rule `is` is at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up.
- rule `you` is at 3 steps down (near the bottom).

So the 'door' rule is two steps left of the 'is' rule (since 6 right vs 7 right is one step left). To make 'door is you', I need to move 'door' next to 'is' and then next to 'you'. But 'you' is at 3 steps down, which is far from where 'door' and 'is' are. That might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe move the 'you' rule closer. But 'you' is part of the current active rule 'baba is you', which is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down (the position of the 'baba' rule). So the 'you' rule is adjacent to 'baba' and 'is'.

If I can move the 'door' rule next to the 'is' and 'you' rules, then door would be you. Let's see:

The 'door' is at 6 right, 2 up. The 'is' is at 7 right, 2 up. So if I move the 'door' one step right, it would be at 7 right, 2 up, next to 'is'. Then, if there's a 'you' next to that, but the 'you' is at 3 steps down. That's a long distance. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule down to connect with 'you'. But moving 'is' would require stepping over, which might be blocked by walls.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I can be you (because baba is you), maybe I can push objects. If I can push the door towards the win area, but the door is a win now. Wait, door is win, so if I can get to the door, I win. But the path is blocked by walls.

Looking at the map structure:

From my position (2 left, 3 down), to reach the door at 6 right, 1 down, I need to move right and down. But there are walls at 3 right in various positions. Let's see:

- Moving right from my position (2 left, 3 down) would take me towards 1 left, 3 down. Then 0 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, which is further. Wait, maybe the walls are at 3 steps right from the origin, which could be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is relative to the rules. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should try moving down first to see if there's a path.

If I move down from my position (2 left, 3 down), I go to 2 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, move right: from 2 left, 3 down to 1 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 3 steps right in various directions. Not sure. Maybe I can move right until I hit a wall.

But the key is at 7 steps right. Maybe I can move the key out of the way, but I don't know if that helps. The door is the win condition now.

Wait, maybe I need to manipulate the rules to make the door a win. But door is already win. So that's not needed. Alternatively, make myself a win by changing the rules. For example, 'baba is win'. But how?

To do that, I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. That's far from where I am. Alternatively, there's a 'rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down'—maybe that's a spare 'key' text block, but key is win, so moving that wouldn't help.

Alternatively, use the existing 'win' rule. If I can move 'win' next to 'baba' and 'is', then 'baba is win' would be created, making me the win. Let's see where 'baba' and 'is' are. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 3 down, and 'is' is at 1 left, 3 down. So if I can move the 'win' rule to be adjacent to them, that would work.

The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 2 up. That's quite far. To get there, I would need to move a lot, but there are walls blocking the path. Maybe not feasible.

Another idea: since door is win, and the door is at 6 right, 1 down, maybe I can push the door towards me. But how? Do I have the ability to push objects? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not stopped. But I need to be adjacent to the object and move in the same direction.

Looking at the door's position: 6 right, 1 down. From my position (2 left, 3 down), to push the door, I would need to be next to it. The distance is quite large, and there are walls in between. Probably not possible.

Maybe the solution is to move the 'door' text block near the 'win' rule to create a new rule. For example, if door is next to win, but door is already win. Not sure.

Wait, the current active rule is 'door is win', so the door is the win object. So if I can reach the door, I win. The problem is the path is blocked by walls.

Looking at the map again:

- My position: rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down.
- Door: 6 steps right and 1 step down.
- The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions, making a barrier.

So the path from my position to the door is blocked by walls at 3 right. How can I move around them?

Maybe I can move the walls by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make 'wall is not stop', then I can push the walls. But how?

The current rule is 'wall is stop', so walls are immovable. To change that, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move either 'wall', 'is', or 'stop' away from each other.

The 'wall' rule is at 1 step left and 2 step up. The 'is' is at 1 step left and 2 step up (same position?), and 'stop' is at 2 step up.

Wait, the objects are:

- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step up

So these three are stacked vertically at 1 left, 2 up. So the rule 'wall is stop' is formed by 'wall' and 'stop' connected by 'is' below. To break this rule, I need to move one of these three.

If I move the 'is' up or down, the rule would break. For example, if I move 'is' to be next to 'wall' and something else, but not 'stop'.

But 'is' is at 1 left, 2 up. If I move it one step up, it would be at 1 left, 3 up. Then the rule 'wall is stop' would be broken, making walls movable.

Once walls are not stop, I could potentially push them out of the way. But how to move 'is'?

To move 'is', I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. My position is 2 left, 3 down. The 'is' is at 1 left, 2 up. The distance is quite far, and there are walls in between. For example, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up, which is blocking the path to the 'is' rule.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and I can be you, maybe I can move through walls by changing the 'stop' property. But that requires breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.

So the plan is:

1. Move the 'is' rule away from 'wall' and 'stop' to break 'wall is stop'.
2. Now walls are movable.
3. Push the walls out of the path to the door.
4. Move to the door and win.

But how to execute step 1? Let's see the positions again.

The 'is' is at 1 left, 2 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent. From my position (2 left, 3 down), the distance to 'is' is two steps left and one step up. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up, which might be blocking the path.

Wait, maybe I can first move down to get closer. From 2 left, 3 down to 2 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, move left from my position to 3 left, 3 down. But I don't know if there's a wall there. The walls are mainly at 3 steps right.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try moving right a few times and see if I can reach the area where the 'is' rule is.

Alternatively, think about the key. The key is at 7 steps right. Maybe moving the key to another position could help, but I don't see how.

Wait, there's a rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe that's a spare 'key' text block. If I can move that 'key' next to 'door' and 'is', maybe it creates a new rule. But key is already win, so maybe not useful.

Another angle: the door is at 6 right, 1 down. The path from my position (2 left, 3 down) to the door requires moving right (to 0 left, 3 down), then right again (1 left, 3 down), then right again (0 left, 3 down?), but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point, which is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the grid is such that moving right from my position takes me closer to the door. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the best immediate action is to try moving down towards the door, hoping there's a path.

So, I'll choose to move down.

Let's try to figure out the solution here. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is a door in this case. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I need to get to the door.

Looking at the objects, the door is at 6 steps to the right and maybe at the same level as me? Let me check the positions. From the observation, rule `door` is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up initially, but in the current observation, it's at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up again. Wait, no, in the current observation, the door is at 6 steps right, no step up or down? Let me parse the objects again.

The current observation lists the door as 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, no, looking at the latest observation:

Objects on the map:
rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 3 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up
...
door 6 steps to the right
...
So the door is at 6 steps right, same level as the wall 3 steps right. So the door is to the right of the wall. But how do I get there?

I'm currently at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So my position is 2 steps left from some reference point and 2 steps down. Let me visualize the map. The walls are spread out in various directions. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe the key isn't immediately necessary since the door is the win condition, but maybe moving the key isn't needed here. 

The main obstacles are walls that are stop. So I need to avoid those. Let me see the path from my current position to the door. If I move right, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up, but maybe that's part of the structure. Wait, the door is at 6 steps right, so maybe I need to go right three times past the walls. But the walls are at 3 steps right, so moving right from my position (which is 2 steps left from... perhaps the center?), maybe each step right gets me closer. Let's think in terms of coordinates. Suppose the reference point is the position of the 'baba' rule, but that's probably not necessary. 

Alternatively, the map might be laid out such that moving right from my current position (2 steps left and 2 steps down) would take me towards the door. Let's see: the door is at 6 steps right. If I'm currently 2 steps left from some point, moving right three times would get me to 3 steps right, but there's a wall there at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, no, the wall at 3 steps right is at the same level as the door? Let me check again.

In the current observation, the walls are at:
- 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- 3 steps to the right (ground level)
- 3 steps to the right and 1 step down

So there's a wall blocking the immediate path to the right. The door is at 6 steps right, which is past these walls. So how do I get there? Maybe I need to move around the walls. Let's see the layout:

From my position (2 left, 2 down), if I move right, I hit a wall at 3 right. So I need to go around it. Maybe move up or down first. If I move up, what's there? At 3 step up, there's a wall and the rule `stop`. Not helpful. If I move down, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So maybe moving down isn't an option. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can move left more? But I'm already 2 steps left. If I move left again, maybe I can find a path. But the door is to the right, so left might not help. 

Wait, perhaps I need to use the rules to change something. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. If I can create a new rule that makes a wall not a stop, or make the door something else. For example, if I can make ""stop is wall"" and rearrange the rules, but I need to move the text blocks. 

Looking at the objects, there are rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`, rule `door`, etc. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to move the key first, but the key is defined as win, but the current win is the door. 

Alternatively, to make the door a you or win. Wait, the current active rule is door is win. So the door is the win condition. So I need to reach it. But how? The path is blocked by walls. 

Maybe move the rule `win` to change what's win. But the rule `win` is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that, but I have to move text blocks that are not stop. The walls are stop, so any text block attached to stop can't be moved. 

Wait, the rule `stop` is at 3 step up. So any text block that is part of a stop rule can't be moved. So the rule `wall`, `is`, `stop` are in the upper part, and they are probably attached to walls, making them immovable. 

But the rule `you` is at 3 steps down. Maybe I can move that. If I can make baba be win by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can create ""baba is win"" and ""you is door"", then touching the door would make me win. But I need to move the text blocks. 

Let me check the current text blocks. The available rules are:

- rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 step up
- rule `door` 6 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 7 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `win` 8 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 1 step right and 2 steps down
- rule `baba` 2 step left and 3 steps down
- rule `is` 1 step left and 3 steps down
- rule `you` 3 steps down

So, to create a new rule like ""baba is win"", I need to move the `baba` text block next to `is` and `win`. The existing `baba` rule is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. The `is` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The `win` is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. That's quite far. 

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the existing rules. For example, if I can move the `you` rule next to `baba` and `win`, making ""baba is win"". Let's see where those are. The `you` rule is at 3 steps down. The `baba` text block is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. The `win` is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, perhaps move the `door` to be win. But the current `win` is already at the door's position via the rule `door is win`. Wait, the rule `door` is at 6 steps right and 3 step up, and the rule `win` is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. So the rule `door is win` makes the door the win condition. 

Maybe the key is a distraction. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can get the key, but I don't know if that's necessary. 

Another approach: since I'm Baba and I have the ""you"" property (from the rule `baba is you`), maybe I can push objects. But the problem is, the walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless I change the rule of stop. For example, if I can make ""stop is push"" or something, but that requires rearranging rules. 

Alternatively, if I can make a path by moving text blocks to change the stop rules. For instance, if I can move the `stop` rule away from the walls, then those walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But the `stop` rule is at 3 step up, attached to a wall. If I move the `stop` text block, would that make the wall no longer stop? Possibly. 

So, the idea is to move the `stop` rule so that the wall it's attached to is no longer considered stop. Let's see. The `stop` rule is at 3 step up, next to a wall. If I can move the `stop` rule to another location, maybe the walls become passable. 

But how to move the `stop` rule? The `stop` rule is part of the upper wall structure. The text blocks there are probably locked because they're part of the stop rule. To move them, I need to navigate to their position and move them, but they might be blocked by other walls. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides the stop property. For example, ""wall is not stop"" by moving text blocks to form that rule. But that requires having the necessary text blocks. 

Looking at the available text blocks, there's ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", ""door"", ""win"", ""key"", ""baba"", ""you"". To make ""wall is not stop"", I would need to create a rule like ""wall is [something else]"". But the existing rules are ""wall is stop"" and others. 

Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" next to ""stop"" and a different property. For example, if I can make ""stop is key"" or something, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the door a you, so touching it makes me win. But the door is already win because of ""door is win"". 

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's think step by step. 

Current position: rule `baba` at 2 step left and 3 steps down. So my position is somewhere, and I need to move to the door at 6 steps right. 

Obstacles: walls at 3 steps right in various directions. 

Possible moves: right, left, up, down. 

If I move right, I hit a wall at 3 steps right. So can't go straight right. 

If I move up, at 3 step up, there's a wall and the stop rule. Still blocked. 

If I move left, from 2 step left to 3 step left, but not sure if that helps. 

If I move down, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So moving down might not help. 

Wait, perhaps I can move diagonally? But the game probably allows only up, down, left, right. 

Alternative approach: Use the rules to change the behavior. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching anything would make me win. But how? 

The current rules are ""baba is you"", ""door is win"". To make ""baba is win"", I need to move the `baba` text block next to `is` and `win`. 

The `baba` text block is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. The `is` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. The `win` is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. 

So, perhaps move the `is` next to `baba` and `win`. But the distance is too great. Maybe move the `win` rule closer? 

The `win` rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. To move it, I need to drag it, but it's not attached to any stop object, so it's movable. Wait, the `win` rule is a separate text block. So if I can move it to be next to `baba` and `is`, then ""baba is win"" would be created. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move the `win` rule from 8 steps right and 3 step up to be next to `baba` and `is`. 

But how to navigate there? My current position is 2 step left and 3 steps down. The `win` is at 8 right, 3 up. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see:

From my position (2 left, 3 down), if I move right twice, I reach 0 left, 3 down. Then move up to 0 left, 2 down, etc. But there are walls blocking. 

Alternatively, move down to 2 left, 4 down. But not sure. 

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: create a rule that makes the door a you, so touching it makes me the you, hence winning. 

Current rule: ""door is win"". If I can change it to ""door is you"", then touching the door would make me you (since I'm Baba and you). 

To do that, I need to move the `you` text block next to `door` and `is`. 

The `you` is at 3 steps down. The `door` is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. The `is` is at 7 steps right and 3 step up (for the ""door is win"" rule). 

So, move the `you` to be next to `door` and `is`. 

But again, the distance is large. 

Alternatively, use the existing `is` at 7 steps right and 3 step up (part of ""door is win""). If I can replace that `is` with a `you`, but that would break the ""door is win"" rule. 

Hmm. This is challenging. 

Another thought: The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe picking up the key allows me to do something, but I don't know how the key interacts here since the win condition is the door. 

Wait, the rule `key` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So there's a rule ""key is win"" somewhere? No, the active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"", ""baba is you"". The key's rule is part of the map's objects but not an active rule. 

Wait, no, the active rules are the ones formed by the text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So in the current observation, the active rules are:

- wall is stop (from rule `wall` next to `is` and `stop`)
- door is win (from rule `door` next to `is` and `win`)
- baba is you (from rule `baba` next to `is` and `you`)

The other text blocks like `key` and `rule `key`` are not forming active rules, so the key's property isn't defined. 

So the key is just an object on the map. Maybe I need to move it somewhere, but I don't see how that helps. 

Back to the main problem: how to reach the door. 

Perhaps the solution is to move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall blocking the path. 

The `stop` rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that rule to another location, the wall it's attached to might no longer be stop, allowing passage. 

To move the `stop` rule, I need to drag it. But how? The `stop` rule is a text block, so if I can navigate to its position and move it. 

The `stop` rule is at 3 step up. My current position is 2 step left and 3 steps down. To get to the `stop` rule at 3 step up, I need to move up. Let's see:

From my position (2 left, 3 down), moving up once takes me to 2 left, 2 down. Then up again to 2 left, 1 down. Then up to 2 left, 0 down (same level as the wall at 3 right, 0 down). But there's a wall there. 

Alternatively, moving left to 1 left, 3 down, then up to 1 left, 2 down, etc. But I'm not sure. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move down to the door's level and then right, avoiding the walls by moving around them. 

Looking at the current observation, the door is at 6 steps right. My current position is 2 step left and 3 steps down. If I move down to 2 step left and 4 steps down, then move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. 

Alternatively, move right from my current position (2 left, 3 down) to 1 left, 3 down. Then right to 0 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 right, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, 3 down. So I can't go past that. 

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. Maybe there's a path through the lower part. 

Looking at the objects:

- At 3 steps right and 1 step up: wall
- At 3 steps right and 2 steps down: wall
- At 3 steps right and 3 steps down: wall

So the path to the right is blocked by walls starting at 3 steps right. 

Perhaps I need to move the ""stop"" rule from 3 step up to another location, making those walls not stop. 

To do that, I need to move the `stop` text block. Let's see where it is. The `stop` rule is at 3 step up. My current position is 2 step left and 3 steps down. To reach the `stop` rule, I need to move up. 

From 2 left, 3 down:

- Move up three times: to 2 left, 0 down (same level as the wall at 3 right, 0 down)
- But there's","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to win this level in Baba Is You. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is to reach the door, which is considered the win condition because of the ""door is win"" rule. But right now, the door is probably blocked by walls or other obstacles.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The key is probably behind some walls. Let me visualize the layout based on the observation.

Starting from Baba's position, which is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the bottom-right wall. So Baba is somewhere in the lower-left part of the grid. The door is at 6 steps to the right, which would be further to the right. There are walls along the way, so moving directly right might be blocked.

The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe if I can move to that key, I can pick it up and use it to open a door? Wait, but the current rules don't mention anything about a key opening a door. The rule is ""door is win,"" so perhaps the key is just a way to get past walls. Maybe the key has a different property when moved?

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects that aren't stopped by ""STOP"" rules. Since walls are stop, but the key isn't a wall, maybe I can move the key. But how do I reach it? Let me check the path.

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving right would take me towards the walls. Let's see: there's a wall at 3 steps right, 3 step up. So moving up from Baba's position might be possible. The key is at 7 right, 1 up. So maybe I need to navigate around the walls.

First, I should move down to avoid the walls above. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving down would be to 2 left, 3 down. Then, maybe move right? But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so I can't go past that. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. Let me map this out.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a text block to change the rules. For example, if I can create a ""key is win"" rule, then picking up the key would make me win. But how to do that? I need to move the ""key is win"" rule text block. Wait, looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"". So that's a ""key is win"" rule. If I can move that rule to be adjacent to the key, then it would activate. But moving that rule might require pathing around walls.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you,"" I can move around unless stopped by walls. So perhaps I need to find a path to the key, then move the ""key is win"" rule onto the key. But that might be complicated. Let's focus on getting to the key first.

Starting position: rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So in coordinates, maybe (Baba's X: 2 left, Y: 2 down). Let's assume that the grid has Baba starting at a certain point. To reach the key at 7 steps right and 1 up, I need to move right and up. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 3 steps right and 3 step up is a wall. So moving up from Baba's position to 2 left, 1 down, then right to 3 steps right, but that's a wall. Hmm.

Wait, maybe moving down first. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving down to 2 left, 3 down. Then, can I move right? There's a wall at 3 steps right, 2 steps down. So moving right from 2 left, 3 down would go to 1 left, 3 down. But then what's there? Let's check the objects. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So maybe moving right isn't possible there.

Alternatively, moving up from Baba's position. To 2 left, 1 down. Then right to 3 steps right, 1 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So can't go there. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to push a wall to create a path. Since walls are stop, but if I can move them, maybe by pushing. Wait, to push a wall, there must be a space behind it where I can move. For example, if there's a wall at position A, and an empty space at position B behind it, I can push the wall from position B to A by moving into B. But I need to be adjacent to the wall and have space behind it.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Behind that (3 right, 3 down) is another wall. So no space to push. What about the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up? Behind that (3 right, 0 up) is empty? Not sure. Maybe I need to find a way to move around these walls.

Alternatively, since the key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule there. The ""rule `key`"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to be next to the key, then the rule would activate, making the key the win condition. Then picking up the key would make me win.

But how to move that rule? To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by STOP. The rule `key` is at 1 right, 2 down. So from Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving right to 1 left, 2 down, then down to 1 left, 3 down. Then right to 0 left, 3 down. Then up to 0 left, 2 down, which is the ""rule `key`"" block. Then I can move it up or down. If I move it up to 0 left, 1 down, then it would be adjacent to the key at 7 right, 1 up. Wait, that's not adjacent. The key is at 7 right, 1 up, which is far away. So moving the rule closer to the key might not help unless I can push it there.

Alternatively, maybe the rule is at 1 right, 2 down. If I move it up to 1 right, 1 down, then it's still not near the key. The key is at 7 right, 1 up. So the rule is at 1 right, 1 down, and the key is at 7 right, 1 up. That's a diagonal distance. Maybe I can push the rule block towards the key by moving around.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since the current goal is the door, which is at 6 right, and it's a win condition, maybe there's a way to path through the door. But the door is at 6 right, so maybe blocked by walls. Let me check the objects. There's a door at 6 steps to the right, and a wall at 3 steps right. So from Baba's position, moving right past the walls might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I can use the key to open the door. But the current rules don't link the key to the door. Unless there's a way to create a ""key is unlock door"" rule, but there's no such text block. Unless I can move existing text blocks to form a new rule. For example, if there's a ""door is win"" rule, and a ""key is unlock"" rule, but I don't see that here.

Looking at the objects again, the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. The other text blocks are:

- rule `wall` at 2 left, 2 up
- rule `is` at 1 left, 2 up
- rule `stop` at 2 up
- wall at 3 right, 2 up
- rule `door` at 6 right, 2 up
- etc.

Maybe the key is a red herring, and the real solution is to manipulate the rules. For example, if I can change ""door is win"" to something else, or make myself a win. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can make ""baba is win,"" then touching the door wouldn't be necessary. But how?

To create a new rule ""baba is win,"" I need the text blocks ""baba"" ""is"" ""win"" adjacent. Currently, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 2 left, 3 steps down, and ""rule `is`"" at 1 left, 3 steps down, and ""rule `win`"" at 9 right, 2 up. So they are not adjacent. Maybe I can move these text blocks.

Starting with the ""rule `baba`"" at 2 left, 3 down. From Baba's current position (2 left, 2 down), moving down to 2 left, 3 down, which is the ""rule `baba`"" block. Then I can move it. Let's see: if I move that block to the right, adjacent to the ""rule `is`"" at 1 left, 3 down. So moving ""rule `baba`"" from 2 left, 3 down to 1 left, 3 down, then it's adjacent to ""rule `is`"". Then, moving the ""rule `is`"" to the right to be adjacent to ""rule `win`"", which is at 9 right, 2 up. Wait, that's not in the same area. This might not be feasible.

Alternatively, focus on the ""rule `you`"" at 3 steps down. Since ""baba is you,"" maybe if I can make ""you"" something else. For example, making ""baba is win"" by moving the text blocks. But the ""win"" rule is far away.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to reach the door by moving around the walls. Let's try to find a path.

Baba is at 2 left, 2 down. The door is at 6 right. So moving right several times. But there's a wall at 3 right, so need to go around. Let's see:

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), move down to 2 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 left, 3 down. Then down to 1 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe this path is blocked.

Alternatively, move up from Baba's position to 2 left, 1 down. Then right to 1 left, 1 down. Then right to 0 left, 1 down. Then up to 0 left, 0 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 0 up. Not helpful.

Another approach: the key is at 7 right, 1 up. If I can get the key and then use it to open a door, but I don't know how. Maybe the key is behind a door that's locked, but there's no ""locked"" rule mentioned.

Wait, in some levels, the key opens a door, which would mean there's an implicit ""key opens door"" rule. But in this case, the active rules are only wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So unless there's a text block that says ""key opens door"", which I don't see, the key might just be a collectible that doesn't do anything. But that can't be right; the key must have a purpose.

Alternatively, maybe the key is used to push a wall. For example, if I have the key, can I push a wall that's stopping me? But the rule ""wall is stop"" still applies, so even with the key, walls would stop me unless I can move them by pushing. But pushing requires space behind the wall.

Let me check the objects again. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Behind that is another wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So no space to push. What about the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up? Behind that is 3 steps right and 0 step up, which might be empty. If I can move the wall there, I could create a path. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the wall and have space behind it.

From Baba's position, can I reach that wall? Let's see: from 2 left, 2 down, move up to 2 left, 1 down. Right to 1 left, 1 down. Right to 0 left, 1 down. Up to 0 left, 0 down. Then right to 3 right, 0 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 step up. Not helpful.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to change the ""door is win"" rule to something else. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the door isn't necessary. To do that, I need to move the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together.

The ""rule `baba`"" is at 2 left, 3 down. The ""rule `is`"" is at 1 left, 3 down. The ""rule `win`"" is at 9 right, 2 up. So they are scattered. Maybe I can first move the ""rule `baba`"" and ""rule `is`"" closer.

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), move down to 2 left, 3 down (which is the ""rule `baba`"" block). Then move right to 1 left, 3 down (adjacent to ""rule `is`""). Then move the ""rule `is`"" to the right to 0 left, 3 down. Now ""baba"" and ""is"" are adjacent. Then move the ""rule `win`"" block from 9 right, 2 up to be adjacent. But that's a long way. How?

Alternatively, after getting ""baba"" and ""is"" next to each other, create the ""baba is win"" rule. But the ""win"" block is far away. Unless there's a way to move it.

This seems too time-consuming and maybe not the intended solution. Let's think differently. Since the key is at 7 right, 1 up, and the door is at 6 right, maybe the key is a distraction, and the real solution is to push a wall out of the way to reach the door.

Wait, the door is at 6 right. There's a wall at 3 right, but if I can move that wall, maybe I can create a path. But the wall at 3 right is part of the structure. Alternatively, the wall at 3 right and 2 step up might be pushable. Wait, there's a wall at 3 right, 2 step up. Behind it is another wall at 3 right, 3 step down. So no space to push.

Another idea: since ""baba is you"", maybe you can push objects. For example, if there's a text block that says ""push is you"", but I don't see that. The only movable things are non-stop objects. Since walls are stop, but other objects like rules or keys might not be. So maybe I can move the ""rule `key`"" block to activate it near the key.

The ""rule `key`"" is at 1 right, 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to be adjacent to the key at 7 right, 1 up, then the rule would take effect. But how to move it there? It's a distance away. Maybe by moving step by step.

From Baba's position, move to the ""rule `key`"" block. Let's see: Baba is at 2 left, 2 down. Move down to 2 left, 3 down. Right to 1 left, 3 down. Up to 1 left, 2 down. Now at the ""rule `key`"" block. Then move this block up to 1 left, 1 down. Then right to 2 left, 1 down. Continue moving it towards the key. But the key is at 7 right, 1 up, which is far. This would take many steps and might not be feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving down towards the door. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), move down to 2 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 left, 3 down. Down to 1 left, 4 down. There's a wall at 3 right, 3 steps down. So can't proceed further. Hmm.

Alternatively, move up from Baba's position to 2 left, 1 down. Right to 1 left, 1 down. Right to 0 left, 1 down. Up to 0 left, 0 down. Then right to 3 right, 0 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 step up. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe the key is at 7 right, 1 up. If I can move there, pick up the key, and then use it to open the door. But how? Unless the key allows me to move through walls, but the rule is ""wall is stop"", so that wouldn't work.

Another thought: if I can make ""key is win"", then touching the key would make me win. To do that, I need the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" adjacent. The ""key"" rule is at 1 right, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. So they're far apart. Maybe move the ""key"" rule towards the ""win"" rule.

But again, this requires moving many steps, and it's unclear if that's the intended path.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe the simplest solution is to move down towards the door and try to find a way around the walls. Let's try moving down and then right.

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), move down to 2 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 left, 3 down. Down to 1 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 3 steps down. Can't go further. Maybe move left instead. From 1 left, 3 down, move","

Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, Baba is the player because of ""baba is you"". The goal is to reach the door, which is defined as win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. But the door is at 6 steps to the right. Wait, the key might be needed to open the door? But the current rules say ""door is win"", so maybe just reaching the door is enough. Hmm. 

Baba is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Let me visualize the position. If Baba is 2 left and 2 down from the reference point, maybe the starting point is 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up? Not sure. The walls are mostly to the right and in various down positions. 

The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. But the door is at 6 steps right and the same level as the current position? Wait, the door is at 6 steps right, same as the key's x-coordinate but maybe different y. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, but the door is at 6 steps right. So maybe moving right towards the door would be better. 

But there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. For example, wall 3 steps to the right, wall 3 steps right and 1 step down, etc. So Baba's position is 2 left and 2 down, so maybe moving right would get past those walls? 

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, so any movement into a wall is not allowed. So I need to find a path to the door (which is win) without hitting walls. Let's check the path from Baba's position. 

Baba is at 2 left and 2 down. Let's see, to get to the door at 6 steps right, maybe moving right multiple times. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So moving right once would take me to 3 steps right, which is a wall. So that's a stop. Can't move right. 

What about down? From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving down would take me to 2 left and 3 down. Are there walls there? There's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. But I'm at 2 left, so maybe that's not in the same row. Hmm, maybe the coordinate system is relative. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move in a different direction. Let's see, the key is at 7 right and 1 up. If I can get the key first, maybe that helps. But how? To reach the key, I need to go right past the wall at 3 steps right. But since wall is stop, I can't. Unless I can move the wall rule. 

Wait, the rules are text blocks that can be moved. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 2 left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can bypass the walls. But the problem is, to move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and not being stopped by a stop property. 

But currently, Baba is at 2 left and 2 down. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is located. The rule `wall` is 2 step to the left and 3 step up from the reference point (probably the starting position). So if I can move that rule, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. 

To move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The rule is at 2 left and 3 up. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up three steps would get to 2 left and 5 down? Wait, maybe the directions are relative. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is not necessary right now. The door is a win condition, so maybe just reaching it is enough. But how to get there without hitting walls. The door is at 6 steps right. From Baba's position, moving right four times would get there, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So that's blocked. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a door at 6 steps right and the same y as the current position? The door is at 6 steps to the right. If I'm at 2 left and 2 down, moving right four times would be 6 steps right (since left is negative?), so maybe that's the direction. But the wall at 3 steps right blocks that path. 

So maybe I need to find another way around. Perhaps moving down past the wall. Let's see, moving down from Baba's position (2 left, 2 down) would take me to 2 left, 3 down. Are there walls there? There's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. But since I'm at 2 left, that's a different column. So maybe moving down is possible. 

After moving down once, I'm at 2 left, 3 down. Then, maybe move right past the walls. But the walls at 3 steps right are at various positions. If I move right from 2 left to 3 left (which is actually moving right one step), but that's the wall. So can't. 

Alternatively, maybe move left. From 2 left to 3 left (more left), but is there a path there? Not sure. There's a rule `baba` at 2 step left and 3 steps down, which is probably the same as the current position. 

Wait, maybe I need to interact with the ""rule `you`"" which is at 3 steps down. Since Baba is you, maybe that's already set. 

I'm stuck. The key is at 7 right, 1 up. But can't reach it. The door is at 6 right. Can't reach directly. The walls are blocking the path. Maybe I need to move some rules to change the game rules. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls. How? To move it, I have to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up three steps would get to 2 left, 5 down? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the directions are relative to the current position. 

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is such that each step is relative to the player's position. This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to move down to avoid the walls. 

So the plan is: move down until there's a path. But how far can I go? Let's see, moving down from 2 left, 2 down to 2 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Yes, wall at 3 right, 3 down. But I'm at 2 left, so that's different. So maybe moving down is possible. 

After moving down once, position is 2 left, 3 down. Next, maybe move right. But the wall is at 3 right, so moving right would take me there. Can't. So maybe move down again. 

At 2 left, 4 down. Are there walls there? The map shows walls at 3 right, 4 steps down. So still blocked. 

This isn't working. Maybe I need to find another rule to move. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 2 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe walls won't be stop anymore. 

To move the ""rule `stop`"" at 2 step up, I need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up two steps would reach the ""rule `stop`"" at 2 left, 0 down (assuming up is negative down). But I'm not sure about the coordinate system. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""rule `stop`"" is located 2 steps up from the current position. So moving up two steps from 2 left, 2 down would get to 2 left, 0 down (if up is positive). Then, pick up that rule and move it somewhere else, like next to a wall, changing its property. 

But how to move the rule? Once I'm adjacent to it, I can push it. Since the rule is not a stop (because it's a rule, and rules can be moved unless they are STOP), I can move it. 

So the steps would be: 

1. Move up two steps to reach the ""rule `stop`"".
2. Move the rule to a different position, perhaps next to a wall, changing its property.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so I can move through them to reach the door.

But this requires navigating around the initial position. Let's see. From Baba's initial position (2 left, 2 down), moving up two steps would be to 2 left, 0 down. Is there a wall there? The map shows walls at 3 steps right and 2 step up. So maybe moving up is possible. 

Once at the ""rule `stop`"", move it to a new location. For example, move it to the position of a wall, changing its property. Then, walls wouldn't be stop anymore. 

After that, move right past the walls to reach the door. 

This seems like a possible solution. But the user is asking for the next action, which should be the first step towards this plan. So the first action would be to move up towards the ""rule `stop`"".

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the door since it's defined as win, but maybe there's a twist.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key at 7 steps to the right. Maybe I need to get that key first. But how? The problem is that some objects are stop, meaning I can't move through them. The walls are stop, so I have to avoid them.

Baba is you, so if I can move around as Baba, maybe I can push other objects? Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change the rules. The key might be important to unlock the door. But how to get the key?

The key is at 7 steps to the right, but there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. So I need to find a path around. Let me check the map structure. The player (Baba) is at 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from the reference point. The key is to the right, but blocked by walls. Maybe I can move down to get around the walls?

Wait, the door is win, but it's at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I can reach the door, that would be the win. But how to get there? The door is next to a wall, so maybe I need to move the wall or change a rule. But right now, wall is stop, so I can't push it unless I change the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to make door a stop or something else. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule ""door is win"" is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can change what door does.

But first, I need to reach the key. Let me see the path. From my current position (rule baba 2 step left and 3 steps down), to get to the key at 7 steps right, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So maybe I have to go around it by moving down or up.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps right, 2 step up; 3 steps right, 1 step up; 3 steps right (directly right); and others below. If I move down from my current position (which is 2 left, 3 down), moving down would take me to 2 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. So that's blocked.

What if I move up? From my position, moving up one step would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Then I can move right past the wall at 3 steps right? Wait, no. The wall is at 3 steps right regardless of up or down. So maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can manipulate rules, maybe I can turn a wall into something movable. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or remove the ""stop"" property. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up. If I can move that rule, say, to the wall itself, then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. But how to move the rule? I have to be adjacent to the rule text block and the target location.

Currently, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up from the rule wall. To move it, I need to be next to the ""stop"" rule and then move it elsewhere. Let's see: the ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up. My position is 2 step left and 3 step down. So moving up from here would take me to 2 left, 2 down. From there, can I reach the ""stop"" rule at 2 step up? Wait, the ""stop"" rule's position is 2 step up from where? Maybe from the reference point. The observation says the rule `wall` is 2 step left and 2 step up, so the reference point might be the starting position.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving towards the key first. To get to the key at 7 steps right, I need to move right past the wall at 3 steps right. Since I can't go through walls, maybe I can find a way around by moving down or up. Let me check the layout again.

If I move right from my current position (2 left, 3 down), each step right increases the right coordinate. The wall is at 3 steps right. So stepping right from 2 left would be towards the wall. If I can't go through walls, I need another path. Maybe moving down first.

From my current position (2 left, 3 down), moving down to 2 left, 4 down. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down, so that's blocked. What if I move up? To 2 left, 2 down. Then move right? The wall is at 3 steps right, so moving right from 2 left would reach the wall at 3 right. Not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" rule to make the key do something else. But the key is at 7 steps right, and the ""key is win"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to the key, then perhaps the key becomes the win condition. But I need to be adjacent to both the ""key is win"" rule and the key object to move it.

Alternatively, since door is win, maybe I just need to reach the door. The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. There's a wall at 3 steps right, so to get to the door, I need to go around the wall. Let's see the path: from my position (2 left, 3 down), move right two steps to reach 0 left, 3 down. Then down to 0 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. Hmm.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to manipulate the rules. If I can change ""door is win"" to something else, or make Baba have a new property. Since Baba is you, maybe I can make Baba win by creating a rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to Baba.

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 step up. My position is 2 left and 3 down. To reach the ""win"" rule, I need to move right and up, but there are walls blocking the path. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to Baba's current position.

But how? I need to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule and the target location (Baba's position). The ""win"" rule is 9 steps right and 3 step up. That's quite far from my current position. Maybe first, I need to navigate to that area, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the key is necessary to unlock the door. If I get the key at 7 steps right, then perhaps I can use it to open the door. But how does the key interact with the door? In some levels, you need a key to unlock a door. If the current rules don't account for that, maybe I need to create a new rule like ""key unlocks door"" or something. But to do that, I need to move the key and door text blocks together.

This is getting complicated. Let me recap: Active rules are wall stops, door is win, Baba is you. Need to reach door or change rules. Obstacles are walls. Maybe the solution is to move the ""door is win"" rule to somewhere else, making door not win, then change another rule to make Baba win. But how?

Alternatively, since Baba is you, if I can make Baba win by creating a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to Baba's position. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 step up. My position is 2 left and 3 down. The distance is quite large, but maybe there's a path around the walls.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. From current position (2 left, 3 down), move up to 2 left, 2 down.
2. Move right to 1 left, 2 down.
3. Move right to 0 left, 2 down. (But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up? Wait, no, the walls are at specific positions. Let me check the walls again.

Looking at the objects: walls are at 3 steps right and 2 step up, 3 steps right and 1 step up, 3 steps right, 3 steps right and 1 step down, etc. So moving right from 2 left, 2 down would take me towards 3 steps right, which is a wall. So that's blocked.

Alternative path: Move down from current position to 2 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up. If I can move that rule away from the walls, then the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule to a different position.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to both the ""stop"" rule and the target location. The ""stop"" rule is currently 2 steps up from the reference point. My position is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So moving up to reach the ""stop"" rule: from 2 left, 3 down, move up once to 2 left, 2 down. Then move up again to 2 left, 1 down. Wait, but the ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up. Maybe the reference point is the starting position, so the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up from there. If I can get to that position, I can move the rule.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I should try a different approach. Since the previous attempts to move down or up resulted in failures, perhaps the correct action is to move right, hoping that there's a way around the wall by manipulating rules. But I can't go through walls, so maybe I need to push a wall if it's not stop. Wait, walls are stop, so I can't push them.

Wait, but in some levels, you can push objects that are not stop. Since wall is stop, I can't push them. But maybe there's another object that can be moved to create a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes wall not stop. For example, move the ""stop"" rule from the wall to somewhere else. If I can remove the ""stop"" property from wall, then I can walk through them.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule text block. The ""stop"" rule is currently at 2 step up. If I can move it to a different location, say next to a wall, then that wall would no longer be stop. But how to move it.

Let me think: My position is 2 step left and 3 step down. The ""stop"" rule is 2 step up. So if I move up twice from my current position, I can reach the ""stop"" rule. Let's see:

1. Move up from 2 left, 3 down → 2 left, 2 down.
2. Move up again → 2 left, 1 down.
3. Now, I'm at 2 left, 1 down. Is the ""stop"" rule here? According to the observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up. Maybe the reference point is the starting position, so moving up two steps from there would place the ""stop"" rule there. If I can get to that location, I can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it.

Assuming that moving up twice gets me to the ""stop"" rule, then I can move it. Once moved, walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to walk through them. Then I can navigate to the key or door freely.

So the steps would be:

1. Move up twice to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule to a new location, say next to a wall, removing its stop property.
3. Then walk through the wall to reach the desired object.

But how to execute this in the given actions. Each action is a single step: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is at 7 steps right, and door is at 6 steps right and 1 down, perhaps I need to get the key first. But how?

If I can move the ""key is win"" rule to the key's location, then picking up the key would make it win. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to both the ""key is win"" rule and the key. The ""key is win"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The key is at 7 steps right. So the distance is large.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't necessary, and the real solution is to change the ""door is win"" to something else. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: Since Baba is you, maybe I can make myself win by creating a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule to Baba's position. The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 3 step up. My position is 2 left and 3 down. The distance is quite far, but perhaps there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe the current rules have a typo. In one of the previous observations, it was ""door is win"" but in another, ""key is win"". Need to check the latest observation.

In the current observation, active rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So door is the win condition. The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. To reach there, I need to go around the wall at 3 steps right.

Let me visualize the map:

Assuming the reference point is the starting position (where the rules are), the map layout might look like this:

- Up direction has walls and rules.
- Right direction has walls and the door/key.
- Down direction has more walls.

My position is somewhere near the bottom left. To get to the door at 6 right, 1 down, I need to move right past the wall at 3 right. Since I can't go through walls, maybe I need to move the wall by changing its rule. But wall is stop, so unless I remove that rule, I can't.

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule from the wall, then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule's location.
2. Move the ""stop"" rule away, making the wall passable.
3. Navigate around the wall to the door.

But how to do this step by step.

First, from my current position (2 left, 3 down), I need to move up to reach the ""stop"" rule at 2 step up. Let's see:

Each move up takes me closer. Let's try:

Action: up → new position: 2 left, 2 down.

Action: up → 2 left, 1 down.

Now, at 2 left, 1 down. Is this where the ""stop"" rule is located? According to the observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up. If the reference point is the starting position, then moving up two steps from there would place the ""stop"" rule there. If I'm at 2 left, 1 down, maybe that's not the exact location.

Alternatively, the ""stop"" rule's position is 2 step up from the rule `wall` which is 2 step left and 2 step up. So maybe the ""stop"" rule is adjacent to the wall.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Given the time constraints, maybe the best action is to move right, hoping to find a way around, or try to move the ""stop"" rule by moving up twice and then moving it.

But since each action is a single step, perhaps the correct action is to move up to reach the ""stop"" rule and then move it. However, the previous attempts to move down or up resulted in defaults to idle, so maybe the correct action now is to move up.

Wait, the last action was ""up"", and the observation didn't change much. Maybe I need to keep moving up to reach the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, since the previous actions didn't work, maybe the correct action is to move right, but that's blocked by a wall. So perhaps the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to the key, making the key the win condition. But how?

Alternatively, since door is win, maybe I can push the door if it's not stop. But door's property is win, not stop, so I can move it. If I can move the door to my position, then I become win. But the door is at 6 right, 1 down. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it.

From my current position (2 left, 3 down), moving right three times and down once would get me to 6 right, 4 down, which is not the door's location. The door is at 6 right, 1 down. That's quite far.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""key"" rule to the key's location, making it win, so picking up the key wins the level. But to do that, I need to move the ""key is win"" rule to the key.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The key is at 7 steps right. So I need to move the rule from 1 right, 2 down to 7 right. That's a distance of 6 steps right and 1 step up. That seems impossible in a single move.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't needed, and the real solution is to change the rule ""door is win"" to something else. For example, move the ""win"" rule from door to Baba.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. My position is 2 left, 3 down. So moving right 10 steps and up 6 steps is not feasible.

Given all this, I think the most plausible action is to try to move towards the ""stop"" rule to remove the wall's stop property. So moving up twice to reach it","

Let's see where I am in the game. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, walls block me, doors are what I need to reach to win, and I am Baba since ""baba is you.""

Looking at the objects on the map, I need to figure out my position and where the key and door are. The key is at 7 steps to the right, and the door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, but there's also a rule `key` at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe that's part of the key's position or another rule?

I need to reach the door to win, but the door is behind a wall? Let me parse the positions again. The wall is 3 steps to the right at various positions. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. So maybe there's a path there. But first, I need to get the key, perhaps? Because sometimes you need a key to open a door, but the rule here says door is win, so maybe just stepping on it is enough. But maybe there's a stop (wall) blocking the path.

Looking at my current position: the rule `baba` is at 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. So my position is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from where the `baba` rule is. Wait, the `baba` rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down from the reference point. But the reference point might be the initial position. I'm a bit confused about the coordinate system here. Maybe it's better to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the door. Let's see. If the door is 6 steps to the right and 1 step down from some point, but I'm at 2 left and 3 down from the `baba` rule. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should move right to approach the door. But wait, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right in several positions. For example, wall 3 steps to the right, wall 3 steps right and 1 down, etc. So moving directly right might hit a wall.

Alternatively, maybe I need to pick up the key first. The key is at 7 steps to the right. But how do I get there? There's a wall at 3 steps to the right, so moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the position of the `baba` rule) would require navigating around the walls. Let's think: my position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if the `baba` rule is at a certain coordinate, say (0,0), then I'm at (-2, -3). The walls are at 3 steps to the right (which would be (3, y)), so that's far to the right. The key is at 7 steps to the right, which is even further. Maybe there's a path through other directions.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down towards the door. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I move down from my current position, maybe I can reach the door without hitting walls. Let me check the walls around there. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, but the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. So between 3 and 6 steps right, there's a gap? Maybe I can move right past the wall at 3 steps right, but wait, there's a wall at 3 steps right at various levels. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects list:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- rule `you` 3 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- door 6 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `key` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- key 7 steps to the right
- wall 3 steps to the right
- etc.

So, moving down from my current position (let's assume I'm at the `baba` rule's position), if I go down, I can check if there's a path. The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move down once, then right 3 times, I might reach the door. But between 3 steps right and 6 steps right, are there walls? There's a wall at 3 steps right, 1 step down. Then, from 3 to 6 steps right, is there a path? The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down, so maybe after passing the wall at 3 steps right and 1 down, I can move right to 6 steps. But how do I get past the wall at 3 steps right?

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, so any object labeled as wall cannot be moved through. But I can push objects if they aren't stopped. Wait, no, the rule is ""wall is stop,"" which means that any object that is a wall has the stop property. So if there's a wall in the path, I can't move through it. But maybe I can move around it.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else, then walls wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" to form a new rule. Let's see where those are.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step up

These three form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move these text blocks to create a new rule, like ""stop is push"" or something, that might remove the stop property from walls. But how? I need to move the ""stop"" text block away from its current position so that the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, and then create a new rule.

But moving text blocks requires that the objects being moved aren't stopped. Since ""wall is stop,"" and ""stop"" is a property, but the text blocks themselves might not be walls. Wait, the text blocks like ""rule `wall`"" are separate objects. Are they considered stop? The rule is ""wall is stop,"" which affects objects that are walls, not the text blocks. So maybe I can move the text blocks.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block to a different position so that the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken.
2. Create a new rule, perhaps ""stop is you"" or ""you is win,"" to change the game mechanics.
3. Then navigate to the door or key using the new rules.

Alternatively, since the key is at 7 steps right, and the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down, maybe I can go for the door directly. But the problem is the walls blocking the path.

Let me try to visualize the grid based on the observations. Assuming the reference point is somewhere, perhaps the initial position of Baba. Let's say Baba is at position (0,0). Then:

- The `baba` rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down: so (-2, -3)
- The `is` rule next to it is 1 step to the left and 3 steps down: (-3, -3)
- The `you` rule is 3 steps down: (0, -3)
- The walls are at 3 steps to the right in various positions: (3, y) where y varies from 4 down to -3.

The door is at (6, -1), and the key is at (7, 0).

So the grid looks like:

From (0,0), moving right to (3, y) are walls. The door is at (6,-1), which is beyond the walls. The key is at (7,0), which is even further right.

To get to the door, I need to move right past the walls. But the walls at (3, y) are at various y positions. For example, there's a wall at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (3,-2), (3,-3). So from y=4 down to y=-3, there's a wall at x=3. That means I can't move right past x=3 in any y direction. Therefore, to reach the door at (6,-1), I need to find a path that doesn't go through x=3.

But how? Maybe moving up or down around the walls. For example, if I can move up from my current position at (-2,-3), perhaps there's a path. Let's see:

From (-2,-3), if I move up to (-2,-2), then check if there's a wall there. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up, which would be (3,2) in this coordinate system. Not sure. Maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, let's consider manipulating the rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-1, -2) [since the `wall` rule is 2 left and 2 up from Baba's position (-2,-3): -2 +2 = 0, -3 +2 = -1; then `is` is 1 left and 2 up: -1 -1 = -2, -1 +2 = 1; `stop` is 2 up from `wall`, so -1 +2 = 1. So the three text blocks form the rule at (-2,1)? Not sure about the exact positioning, but the idea is that those three blocks are together to make ""wall is stop.""

If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. Then walls would no longer be stop, and I could push them or move through them. Then I could move right past the walls at x=3.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block from its current position (2 step up from the `wall` rule) to a different location where it doesn't form part of the ""wall is stop"" rule anymore.
2. Once ""wall is stop"" is broken, walls are no longer blocking, so I can move right through them.
3. Then navigate to the door at (6,-1) or the key at (7,0).

But how to move the ""stop"" block? The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up from the `wall` rule. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but it's possible that the ""stop"" block is considered a stop itself? Wait, no. The rule ""wall is stop"" makes any object that is a wall have the stop property. The text blocks like ""rule `stop`"" are separate objects and are not walls unless there's a rule defining them as such. So as long as ""wall is stop"" is active, the text blocks can be moved because they aren't walls. Wait, no—the text blocks themselves are objects on the map. Are they considered walls? Only if there's a rule saying ""rule `stop` is wall"" or something. Since the current rules are ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"", and ""baba is you"", the text blocks like ""rule `stop`"" are just text blocks and not classified as walls. Therefore, I can move them.

So, the plan is:

- Move the ""stop"" text block away from its current position so that the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer formed.
- Then, create a new rule that allows movement through walls or changes the win condition.

But first, I need to locate the ""stop"" text block. According to the observation, the rule `stop` is at 2 step up. The rule `wall` is 2 step to the left and 2 step up, then rule `is` is 1 step to the left and 2 step up, and rule `stop` is 2 step up. So their positions are:

- wall rule: (-2, -3) + (2 left, 2 up) = (-4, -1)
- is rule: (-4, -1) + (1 left, 0) = (-5, -1)
- stop rule: (-4, -1) + (0, 2 up) = (-4, 1)

So the three text blocks forming ""wall is stop"" are at (-4,-1), (-5,-1), (-4,1). To break this rule, I need to move at least one of them. The easiest is to move the ""stop"" rule at (-4,1) to a different location.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Assuming my current position is at the `baba` rule, which is at (-2,-3), I need to navigate to the ""stop"" rule's position (-4,1). That's quite a distance. Let's see the path:

From (-2,-3) to (-4,1):

- Move left twice: (-4,-3)
- Move up four times: (-4,1)

But along the way, are there any walls or immovable objects? The walls are at x=3, various y's. So moving left to x=-4 is possible as long as there are no walls there. Looking at the objects list, there's no wall mentioned at x=-4, so it should be safe.

Once I reach (-4,1), the ""stop"" rule, I can move it. For example, move it down to (-4,0). That would break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

After breaking that rule, walls no longer block movement. Then I can move right past the walls at x=3.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""stop is you"", making whatever is stop now be you. But that might complicate things.

Once walls are no longer stop, I can move freely. Then go to the door at (6,-1) or the key at (7,0).

But this requires a series of moves: moving from current position to the ""stop"" rule, moving it, then navigating.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. If I can pick up the key first, then use the key to open the door. But the key is at 7 steps to the right, which is behind multiple walls. Without being able to move through walls, it's impossible.

Therefore, the key action is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how to execute this in the game? The user expects a single action, like up, down, left, right, or idle.

Given that the previous attempts resulted in failures, maybe the initial approach of moving down was incorrect. Perhaps I should first try to move towards the ""stop"" rule to alter the rules.

But the problem is that the assistant is supposed to output a single action per step. So maybe the first step is to move in a direction that brings me closer to the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is simpler. Since the door is a win condition, and the key is nearby, maybe the key isn't necessary. Maybe stepping on the door is enough. But the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down, blocked by walls.

Wait, looking at the objects again: door 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Are there walls blocking the path to the door? The wall at 3 steps right extends from y=4 down to y=-3. So from x=3, y=-3 to y=4, it's blocked. The door is at x=6, y=-1. So the path from x=3 to x=6 would require moving right past x=3, but x=3 is blocked by walls. So unless I can move the walls or break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can't get past.

Therefore, the only way is to alter the rules. The immediate action should be to move towards the ""stop"" text block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But the assistant can only output one action at a time. So the first action should be to move in a direction that gets closer to the ""stop"" rule.

Given that the ""stop"" rule is at (-4,1) from the initial position, and the assistant's current position is at (-2,-3), moving left twice and up four times would get there, but that's multiple steps. However, the game might require each action to be a single step.

Therefore, the initial action should be to move left from the current position. The current position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So moving left would take towards the ""wall"" rule.

Wait, the `baba` rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down from the reference point. If the reference point is, say, the initial position, then moving left from there would be towards negative x direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the best immediate action is to move up, trying to reach a position where I can see or interact with the rule texts.

But this is getting too vague. Given the constraints, the best action now is to move up to get closer to the ""stop"" rule's location.

So the chosen action is up.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the door since door is win, but sometimes you can change the rules.

Looking at the objects, I see a key at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how? The key is probably behind some walls. Let me check the map layout.

Baba is at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. The rule 'you' is at 4 steps down, which must be attached to Baba since baba is you. So, I'm controlling Baba. The walls are everywhere, especially to the right. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down, which is a win condition. But I might need the key to unlock it, but the current rules don't mention a door needing a key. Wait, the rule 'door is win' means just reaching the door makes you win, right?

So maybe I can go straight to the door. Let's see the path. From Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), moving down to 3 steps down is a wall. Moving right would hit a wall at 3 steps right. Up? If I go up one step, that's 1 step up from Baba, which would be position (2 left, 3 down). Is there a wall there? The map shows a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but that's not in the same column. Wait, maybe the walls are blocking movement to the right. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move left from Baba's position. Left would be 1 step left and 4 steps down. Is there a wall there? The rule `wall` is 2 steps to the left and 1 step up. Not sure. Maybe there's a path left. Let me visualize the grid:

Baba is at (0,0) assuming his position. Let's assign coordinates. The rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up from Baba would be at (-2, 4). The 'is' is at (-1,4), then 'stop' at (0,4). Wall at (3,4). Then the rule 'door' is at (6,4), etc. But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on immediate movement.

From Baba's position (2 left, 4 down), possible moves: left, right, up, down. Let's check each:

- Left: 1 step left and 4 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up is not in this direction. Maybe it's safe. But the active rules have wall is stop, so if there's a wall in that direction, I can't move. But I don't see a wall mentioned in that exact position. The walls listed are at specific positions relative to other rules. Maybe I can move left.

- Right: Straight right would be 3 steps right (since the wall is at 3 steps right and 4 step up, which is a different direction). So moving right from Baba's position (2 left,4 down) to 3 steps right (1 step right relative to Baba?) Wait, maybe the coordinates are confusing. The objects are described relative to Baba's position. For example, rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 1 step down, which would place Baba at position (0,0), and the rule is at (-2,-1). But I'm getting stuck on coordinates.

Alternatively, think about the immediate surroundings. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking. The wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 step up is not in the way here. Maybe the walls are horizontal? Like, from Baba's position, moving right would hit a wall at 3 steps right. So perhaps I can't go directly right.

The door is at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I can reach there, that would win. But how? Maybe moving down from Baba's position. Let's see: down one step would be 2 left and 5 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down is in a different position. Maybe safe.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. Since the key is win in the previous level, but now it's door. But here, door is win. So perhaps just reach the door. But the path is blocked by walls. Wait, the rule `key` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can pick up the key by moving to that position, but I need to see if it's possible.

Wait, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step down from Baba. But how to get there? There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 step up, but that's above. Maybe the path is clear to the right until a wall. Let me think step by step.

Baba's position: rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I'm at (0,0), the rule is at (-2,-1). The 'you' rule is at (1 step left, 3 steps down?), no, the 'you' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down relative to Baba. So Baba is at (0,0), 'you' is at (-1, -3). Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should focus on the possible moves.

Looking at the objects, the door is at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. To get there from Baba's position (2 left,4 down), I need to move right 8 steps and down 2 steps? That seems impossible because of walls. Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are different. Perhaps the map is laid out such that moving up or down changes the row, and left/right changes the column.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is near the door. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step down, door is at 6 right and 2 down. So if I get the key first, maybe I can use it to unlock the door, but the current rules don't mention a lock. Since door is win, maybe just reaching it is enough.

But how to reach the door without hitting walls. The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. Let's see: from Baba's position, moving right 3 steps would hit a wall at 3 steps right. So I can't go straight right. Maybe move down first, then right.

If I move down from Baba's position (2 left,4 down) to 2 left,5 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down is in a different location. Maybe safe. Then move right step by step. But after a few steps right, there's a wall at 3 steps right. So maybe I can't get past that. Unless I can move around it by going up or down.

Alternatively, move left from Baba's position. Left 1 step to 1 left,4 down. Is there a wall? The wall at 2 steps left and 1 step up is not in this direction. Maybe safe. Then continue left. But where does that lead? The rule `wall` is at 2 left and 1 up, which is not in the same path. Maybe I can reach the 'is' rule at 1 left and 3 down, which is part of the 'baba is you' rule. Not sure.

Alternatively, look for text blocks to manipulate rules. The key is at 7 right,1 down. If I can move the 'key is win' rule, but the current active rule is 'door is win'. Wait, in the previous observation, there was a 'key is win' rule, but now it's changed. Maybe I need to rewrite the rules. For example, make 'door' be 'stop' so I can push it, or make 'baba' be 'win' to win by standing on him.

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. Let's see the objects. There's a rule `key` at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can move that to create a new rule, like 'key is stop' or 'baba is win'. But how?

Baba is you, so if I can create a rule like 'baba is win', then standing on Baba would make me win. But to do that, I need to find the 'win' rule and replace it. The current 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 step up. So maybe move the 'win' rule near Baba and change it to 'baba'.

But moving requires that the objects aren't stopped. The wall is stop, so if I can move past walls. Wait, the rules say 'wall is stop', meaning walls are immovable. So any text block on a wall can't be moved. But the 'wall' rule itself is a text block. If I can move the 'wall' rule, then the wall would no longer be stop. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'you' rule. Since Baba is you, maybe creating a new 'you' rule for another object, making that object controllable. For example, make 'door is you', then you can move the door. But the door is a win condition, so if you move it onto Baba, that might work.

But this is getting too complex. Let's try a simpler approach. The immediate goal is to reach the door. If I can find a path around the walls. From Baba's position, move down, then right, then up? Let's see:

1. Down: 2 left,5 down. Is there a wall? The wall at 3 right,2 down is not here. Safe.
2. Right: 1 left,5 down. Check for walls. The wall at 3 right is in a different position. Safe.
3. Right again: 0 left,5 down. Still no wall mentioned here. Safe.
4. Right again: 1 right,5 down. Now check if there's a wall. The wall at 3 right is further right. Safe.
5. Continue right until reaching the door's position. But the door is at 6 right,2 down. So need to adjust steps.

Alternatively, move down, then right, then up to navigate around the wall at 3 right. Maybe this path is possible.

But I'm not sure. Another option is to move left, find a way to rearrange rules. For example, move the 'door is win' rule to be under Baba, making 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule which is at 8 right,2 up. But moving that requires pathing around walls.

This is tricky. Maybe the simplest solution is to try to move towards the door step by step, avoiding walls. Let's attempt:

First action: down. From Baba's position, moving down to 2 left,5 down. No wall mentioned there. Next, right to 1 left,5 down. Then right again to 0 left,5 down. Continue right until 3 right,5 down (but there's a wall at 3 right in some positions). Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up is not in this path. Maybe safe. Then move up to 3 right,4 down. Check if there's a wall. The wall at 3 right and 4 up is in a different direction. Maybe can move up. Then close to the door's position at 6 right,2 down.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: since the key is nearby, pick it up to see if it helps. The key is at 7 right,1 down. To reach there, move right 5 times (from 2 left to 7 right would be 9 steps right?), but there's a wall at 3 right. So maybe can't get there.

Alternatively, check if the 'key' rule can be moved. The 'key' rule is at 1 right,2 down. If I can move that rule to create a new rule, like 'key is stop' to remove its win property, but that might not help.

Alternatively, create a rule 'baba is win' by moving the 'win' rule to be under Baba. The 'win' rule is at 8 right,2 up. To move it, need to path around walls. From Baba's position, move up, right, up, etc., but it's a long path.

This level is challenging. Given the time I've spent, maybe the best immediate action is to move down to avoid walls and then try to maneuver around. So the first action would be down.

I need to figure out what action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let's look at the current observation again.

The active rules are still wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, the walls are stopping me, the door is the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, my position must be near the ""rule baba"" text block. The rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, how do I position myself relative to that? Maybe I need to move to that rule to manipulate it. 

The key is at 7 steps to the right. But the door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. To get to the door, which is the win, I might need the key. But the key is currently possibly blocked by walls. 

Looking at the map structure, there's a wall 3 steps to the right in various positions. The rule `key` is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to move there to get the key? But how? 

Wait, the rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from where I am. If I can move to that rule, maybe I can change it. For example, if I make ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key"", that could change things. But to do that, I might need to move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"". 

So, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move that ""is"" next to the ""baba"" rule, then I can change the property of Baba. But how do I move the ""is"" rule? The rules that are not STOP can be moved. The wall is stop, so I can't move walls. 

My current position is probably near the rule `baba` since that's a key component. If I move down once, I might reach the ""is"" rule. Let me check the positions again. 

Rule `baba` is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I'm currently at the same Y level as the ""you"" rule (3 steps down), moving left 2 steps and down 3 steps would get me to the ""baba"" rule. But maybe I need to move in a different direction. 

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on getting the key first. The key is at 7 steps to the right. But the path might be blocked by walls. Looking at the map, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right, and then the key is at 7 steps to the right. So the distance between them is quite a few steps, and there might be walls in between. 

Alternatively, maybe manipulating the rules to make walls not stop. But the current rule is ""wall is stop"", so unless I change that, walls will block movement. To change that, I need to move the ""is"" rule that says ""wall is stop"". The ""is"" rule for wall is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""is"" rule elsewhere, maybe I can make wall not stop. But how to reach that position? 

Wait, the rule `wall` is at 1 step left and 4 step up, and the corresponding ""is"" is at 1 step right and 4 step up. So the structure is ""wall IS stop"". To change that, I need to move either the ""wall"" rule, the ""stop"" rule, or the ""is"" connecting them. 

But moving the ""is"" rule would require me to be adjacent to it. The ""is"" rule for wall is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move towards that position, perhaps by moving up and right. But the current map layout has walls at 4 steps right in various positions, which might block my path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can focus on reaching the door. The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. To get there, I need to move right and down. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see: from my current position (assuming I'm at the rule `baba` position: 2 step left and 3 steps down), moving right 4 steps would get me to the wall at 4 steps right. So that's blocked. Maybe I need to find another path. 

Wait, the key is at 7 steps right. If I can get the key, maybe the door becomes accessible. But again, the path is blocked. 

Let me recap the possible actions. The valid actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. I need to choose one. 

Given that the previous attempts failed, maybe I need to try moving down again. In the last observation, moving down was the chosen action, but it didn't work. Maybe I need to move in a different direction. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move towards the ""is"" rule that's next to ""baba"". The rule `is` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. If I can move to that position, I can then move it next to the ""baba"" rule to change what Baba is. 

So, the steps would be: move right once to get to the ""is"" rule, then move down to position it next to ""baba"". Then, the rule would become ""baba is [something else]"", like ""win"" or ""key"", allowing me to interact with those objects. 

But how do I move the ""is"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but since ""is"" is a text block, I can move it if it's not defined as STOP. Currently, nothing is making ""is"" stop, so I should be able to move it. 

So, if I move right once to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down, then move down to place it next to the ""baba"" rule. Then, I can rewrite the rule to make Baba win or key. 

But I need to check if that's possible given the current map. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. If I move the ""is"" rule to be adjacent to it, say to the right, then the rule would be ""baba IS [whatever is next]"". 

Alternatively, maybe I should first get the key. To get the key at 7 steps right, I need to navigate around the walls. But the path is blocked by multiple walls. 

Another approach: since the door is win, maybe I can change the ""door is win"" rule to make something else win. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". 

The ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 2 steps up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. These are quite far apart. Maybe there's a way to move the ""win"" rule closer. 

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule that's connected to ""win"" (which is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up) to connect it to ""baba"". But that would require moving multiple text blocks. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to prioritize. The immediate goal is to reach the door, which is win. To do that, either find a way past the walls or change the rules. 

Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So maybe changing the ""wall is stop"" rule is essential. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" that connects ""wall"" to ""stop"". The ""is"" is at 1 step right and 4 step up. 

If I can move that ""is"" rule away from ""wall"" and ""stop"", then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Then walls wouldn't be stop. But how to reach that position? 

From my current position (assuming near the ""baba"" rule at 2 left, 3 down), moving up 4 steps and right 1 step would get to the ""is"" rule. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let's see: 

Current position: let's assume I'm at the position of the ""you"" rule, which is 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule for ""you"" is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So if I'm at the ""you"" rule, moving right would take me to the ""is"" rule. Then, moving up to the ""wall is stop"" area. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move down to reach certain areas. 

Alternatively, since the previous actions kept failing, maybe the solution is to move towards the ""is"" rule adjacent to ""baba"" and then move it to rewrite the rule. 

So, the plan is:

1. Move right to reach the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down.
2. Move down to position the ""is"" next to the ""baba"" rule.
3. Then, the rule becomes ""baba IS [whatever is on the other side]"", allowing Baba to have a new property.

But how to execute this movement? Let's break it down step by step. 

Current position: Assuming I'm at the ""you"" rule, which is 3 steps down. To get to the ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 3 steps down, I need to move left once. Then, from there, move down to get to the ""baba"" rule which is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe the coordinates are relative. 

This is a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the descriptions:

- rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 3 steps down from some reference point.

Assuming the player's position is near the ""you"" rule at 3 steps down, moving left 2 steps and down 3 steps would reach the ""baba"" rule. But that might not be possible if there are walls in the way. 

Alternatively, the ""baba"" rule's position is relative to another object. Maybe the player is at the same position as the ""you"" rule, which is 3 steps down. The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from there, so moving left 2 and down 3 would place the player at the ""baba"" rule. 

But if the player is at the ""you"" rule (3 steps down), moving down 3 steps would go further down, but the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps down as well. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point. 

This is getting too ambiguous without seeing the actual layout. Given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action is to move down to reach the ""is"" rule adjacent to ""baba"" and then move it. 

Alternatively, since the last action was down and it failed, maybe try moving right instead. 

But I need to make sure the action is valid. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, idle. 

Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best action is to move down to get closer to the relevant rules. 

So, the chosen action is down.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, I need to reach the door to win, but I have to avoid walls because they stop me.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. But right now, the key is probably behind some walls. Wait, there's a door at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Maybe that's the win condition. But how do I get there?

Baba is you, so I can move around, but walls block me. Let me check my position. The rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down from the wall at 3 steps to the right. Hmm, that might mean my current position is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from the wall at (3 right, 0?). Not sure about the exact coordinates, but maybe I need to move down.

There's a rule `you` at 3 steps down. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", that means I have the 'you' property. So, I can move, but need to avoid stop (walls). The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So maybe I need to go around the walls.

Looking at the map, there's a door at 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can get there, I win. But how? Let's see the path. From my current position (assuming the rule `baba` is at 2 left and 3 down from the wall at 3 right), moving down might take me closer. Alternatively, maybe moving left towards the key and door?

Wait, the key is at 7 right and 1 up, which is probably to the right and up from where I am. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so maybe I need to move around that. Alternatively, if I can rearrange the rules, maybe I can change 'key is win' or something. But the current rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the door? But I don't see any 'push' rule. Hmm. The key might not be necessary right now. The door is the win condition. So I need to reach the door at 6 right, 1 down.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps right at various positions. If I move down from my current position (rule `baba` is at 2 left and 3 down), moving down might take me to 2 left and 4 down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. Wait, not sure. Maybe I should try moving down to get closer to the door.

Alternatively, move right to avoid walls. But the wall at 3 steps right is a stop, so I can't move into it. Let me see: if I'm at 2 left and 3 down, moving right would take me to 1 left and 3 down. Is there a wall there? The wall is at 3 steps right, so maybe that's not the direction. Maybe moving down is safer.

So, the action should be down. Let me confirm: if I move down, I'd be closer to the door at 6 right, 1 down. But I need to check if there's a wall in that path. The wall at 3 right and 3 down is one step down from the current position. So moving down once would take me to 3 steps right and 4 down? Not sure. But the door is at 6 right, 1 down, which is further away. Maybe I need to get to the key first to unlock the door? But the key's rule is at 1 right and 2 down, which might be movable.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the 'door is win' rule. If I can move the 'win' text block to the key's position, then the key becomes the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the 'win' rule (which is at 8 right, 2 up) to where the key is. But how? I have to move the text blocks, but I can only move them if they're not stopped by 'stop' properties.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right and 2 up. To get there, I'd need to navigate around walls. But that might be complex. Maybe it's faster to just go to the door as it is. So, the best action is to move down towards the door.

Let's see. The current active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall. The goal is to reach a door because door is win.

Looking at the objects on the map. There's a key at 7 steps to the right and 2 steps up. But the key isn't a win condition right now; door is. So maybe I need to get the key first? Or perhaps the key isn't necessary here. Let me check the position of the door. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. So the path to the door is blocked by a wall. 

Wait, the rule 'wall is stop' means that any object labeled as wall can't be moved through. So I need a way to remove that wall or maybe change the rule. But how? The key is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can get the key, maybe there's a way to use it. But how does the key come into play here? The current rules don't associate the key with anything. 

Looking at the other rules: rule `key` is at 1 step to the right. Maybe if I move that rule somewhere else, like combining it with 'win' to make 'key is win', then the key would become the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the 'key' text block and the 'is' text block together. Let's see where those are. 

The 'key' rule is at 1 step to the right. The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. Wait, the rule `is` 1 step left and 1 step down. So if I can move the 'key' text block next to the 'is' and then somewhere else to form 'key is win', that could work. But I need to be careful about moving them without hitting a stop (wall).

Alternatively, maybe I can push the door or the wall. But the door is a win condition, so maybe pushing it isn't allowed. The walls are stop, so I can't push them either. Hmm. 

Another thought: since Baba is you, if I can change the 'baba is you' rule to something else, maybe I can become the key or the door. For example, if I make 'baba is key', then I would be a key, and maybe that helps. But how to do that? I need to move the 'baba' rule, the 'is' rule, and the 'key' rule together. 

Let me map out the positions. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The 'key' rule is at 1 step right. So if I move right towards the 'key' rule, maybe I can combine them. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so I can't go past that. 

Wait, the current position of Baba (the player) is at 2 steps left and 1 step down relative to some reference point. Let me think about the movement. The user needs to output an action like up, down, left, right, or idle. 

Looking at the objects near me: the 'baba' rule is 2 steps left and 1 step down. The 'is' rule is 1 step left and 1 step down. The 'key' rule is 1 step right. So if I move right once, I can reach the 'key' rule. But moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the position of the 'baba' entity) would take me to the 'key' rule's location. But wait, the 'key' rule is at 1 step right, so if I'm at the 'baba' rule's position, moving right would place me next to the 'key' rule. 

Once I have the 'key' rule, maybe I can move it to combine with 'is' and 'win' to make 'key is win'. But first, I need to pick up the 'key' rule. Since the rules allow moving text blocks that aren't stop, and the 'key' rule isn't marked as stop, I can move it. 

So the plan would be: move right to get the 'key' rule, then move up or down to position it next to the 'is' rule, then move it next to the 'win' rule to create 'key is win'. That way, the key becomes the win condition, and I can just grab the key to win. 

But how to do that step by step. Let's see. Current position of the 'baba' entity is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. Wait, no, the 'rule `baba`' is 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So the player (Baba) is at that position. So to move right, the player would go towards the 'key' rule. 

So action: right. Then, once next to the 'key' rule, take it. Then move up or down to reach the 'is' rule. The 'is' rule is 1 step left and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule. So if I'm at the 'key' rule's position (1 step right from 'baba'), I need to move left to get to the 'is' rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so moving left from the 'key' position would take me to 0 steps right, which might be next to the 'is' rule. Wait, the 'is' rule is 1 step left and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule. So if the 'baba' rule is at (0,0) for example, then 'is' is at (-1, -1). The 'key' rule is at (1,0). So moving from (1,0) to (-1,-1) would require moving left and down, but there are walls in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let me think. The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down from 'baba'. So if I'm at the 'key' rule's position (1 step right), I need to move left twice and down once. But between there and the 'is' rule, there's a wall at 3 steps right, which is actually at 3 steps right from the reference point. So moving left from the 'key' position (1 step right) would take me to 0 steps right, which is clear? Not sure. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to first get the key, then move it to the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. So from the 'key' rule at 1 step right, I need to move right 7 times and up 2 times. But there are walls along the way, like at 3 steps right. So that path is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules vertically. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. The 'is' rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. So if I can move the 'key' rule to 7 steps right and 2 steps up, then place 'is' next to it, making 'key is win'. 

But how to navigate there. It's going to take a lot of moves, and I might get stuck. Maybe another approach: since the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step up, and there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, perhaps I can push the wall out of the way? But the wall is a stop, so I can't push it. 

Wait, the rules are 'wall is stop', meaning that any object labeled 'wall' cannot be moved. So I can't push the wall. That's a problem. 

So the key might be the way to go. If I can make the key the win condition, then picking up the key would win the level. To do that, I need to create the rule 'key is win'. 

The current 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. The 'key' rule is at 1 step right. The 'is' rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. So perhaps I can move the 'key' rule to 7 steps right and 2 steps up, then place the 'is' rule next to it, followed by the 'win' rule. 

But moving the 'key' rule from 1 step right to 7 steps right would require moving right 6 times, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So that's impossible. 

Alternative idea: Maybe rearrange the existing 'is' and 'win' rules. The 'is' is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up, and 'win' is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the 'is' rule left to 6 steps right and 2 steps up, then place 'key' there, making 'key is win'. 

But how to move the 'is' rule. The 'is' rule is part of the existing 'door is win' rule. To move it, I need to pick it up and place it elsewhere. Since 'is' isn't a stop, I can move it. 

So steps could be:
1. Move right to get the 'key' rule (from 1 step right).
2. Move up to reach the area where 'is' and 'win' are located (2 steps up).
3. Move left past the wall at 3 steps right to reach 2 steps right.
4. Place the 'key' rule next to the 'is' rule, then the 'win' rule.

But this requires navigating around the wall. Let's see. From the 'key' position (1 step right), moving up to 2 steps up would get me to the area of the 'door' rule. Then moving left from 1 step right to 2 steps right (wait, no, moving left from 1 step right would decrease the step count. Maybe I need to adjust coordinates differently. 

This is getting too confusing without a visual. But based on the previous observations, the key is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up initially, but in the latest observation, the key is at 7 steps right. Wait, looking back, in the current observation, the key is at 7 steps to the right. So maybe the key is near the door. 

If I can reach the key, then move it to combine with 'is' and 'win', that would make key the win condition. So the plan is: move towards the key, pick it up, then move to the 'is' and 'win' rules, and rearrange them. 

But the problem is the path to the key is blocked by walls. The key is at 7 steps right, same level as the door. The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. So from the player's position (assuming near the 'baba' rule at 2 step left and 1 step down), moving right towards the key would require passing through walls at 3 steps right. 

Wait, the wall is at 3 steps right in several positions (4 step up, 3 step up, 1 step up, etc.). So moving right from the player's position (which is at the 'baba' rule's location, 2 step left and 1 step down) towards the key at 7 steps right would require moving right multiple times, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So that path is blocked. 

Alternative route: Maybe move up or down first to find a path around the wall. For example, move up to 2 step up, then right past the wall at 3 steps right. But the wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up exists, so that's still blocked. 

This is tricky. Maybe instead of going for the key, try to manipulate the existing rules. The 'door is win' rule is there. If I can make myself a door, then touching the door would make me a win. Since 'baba is you', if I can change 'baba' to 'door', then I would be a door, which is a win. 

To do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule, the 'is' rule, and the 'door' rule together. The 'baba' rule is at 2 step left and 1 step down. The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The 'door' rule is at 6 steps right and 2 step up. 

So the plan would be:
1. Move to the 'is' rule's position (1 step left and 1 step down from 'baba').
2. Swap the 'is' rule with the 'door' rule somehow.
3. Combine 'baba is door', making me a door, which is a win.

But how to physically move these rules. The 'baba' rule is 2 step left and 1 step down. To reach the 'is' rule, which is 1 step left and 1 step down, I need to move left once. Then, from there, move up or down to reach the 'door' rule. 

Alternatively, maybe move the 'is' rule next to the 'door' rule and then next to the 'baba' rule. For example:
- Move left to get to the 'is' rule.
- Move up to reach the 'door' rule's area.
- Place the 'is' rule next to 'door', making 'door is ...', then move 'baba' next to it to make 'baba is door'.

But the 'door' rule is at 6 steps right and 2 step up, which is quite far. 

This seems complicated. Another angle: the 'key' is at 7 steps right. If I can get to the key, then maybe push it towards the 'win' rule. But again, the path is blocked. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to move the wall. Since walls are stop, they can't be moved. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is not necessary, and the real solution is to rearrange the existing rules. For example, if I can make 'door is you' instead of 'door is win', then touching the door would make me win. But how? The current rules are 'door is win', 'baba is you'. 

To change 'door is win' to 'door is you', I need to move the 'win' rule away and replace it with 'you'. But the 'you' rule is already at 3 steps down. 

So maybe:
1. Move the 'win' rule from 8 steps right and 2 step up to somewhere else.
2. Bring the 'you' rule next to 'door' and 'is' to make 'door is you'.

But the 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. That's far away. 

This seems really challenging. Maybe the simplest solution is to go for the key and then make it the win condition. Even though the path is blocked, perhaps there's a way. 

Alternatively, since the door is a win, maybe there's a way to remove the wall blocking the path to the door. But the wall is a stop, so I can't push it. 

Wait, maybe if I change the 'wall is stop' rule to 'wall is', which would remove the stop property. Then I could move through walls. But how to do that. 

To change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is', I need to move the 'stop' property elsewhere. For example, create 'floor is stop' and then 'wall is'. But that requires having the 'floor' rule, which I don't see here. 

Alternatively, just break the 'wall is stop' rule by moving the 'stop' text block away. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step up. If I can move it, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. 

So steps:
1. Move to the 'stop' rule's position (2 step up).
2. Grab the 'stop' rule and move it somewhere else, like next to a different rule.

But how to reach the 'stop' rule. The player is at the 'baba' rule's position (2 step left and 1 step down). To get to the 'stop' rule at 2 step up, the player needs to move up twice. 

Action sequence:
- Move up twice to reach the 'stop' rule.
- Take the 'stop' rule and move it, say, next to the 'key' rule to make 'stop is key' or something. 

But this might not be the right approach. If I remove 'wall is stop', then walls become passable. Then I could go around them to the door. 

So, the plan is:
1. Move up to the 'stop' rule at 2 step up.
2. Move the 'stop' rule away, maybe to the right, changing the rule to 'floor is stop' or something else.
3. Now walls are not stop, so I can walk through them to reach the door.

But I need to see if that's possible. Let's see. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step up. The player needs to move up twice from their current position (assuming they start at 'baba' rule's location). Once there, they can pick up the 'stop' rule and move it. 

For example:
- Action: up (twice) to reach the 'stop' rule.
- Then, move right or left to place the 'stop' rule elsewhere. 

If I move the 'stop' rule to the right next to the 'key' rule, creating 'stop is key', that would remove the 'wall is stop' rule. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing the player to walk through them. 

Once that's done, the player could go around the wall to the door at 6 steps right and 1 step up. 

This seems like a feasible solution. So the steps would be:
1. Move up twice to reach the 'stop' rule.
2. Move the 'stop' rule to the right, say next to the 'key' rule.
3. Now walls are not stop, so move right past the wall at 3 steps right.
4. Reach the door at 6 steps right and 1 step up, which is a win.

This seems like a solid plan. So the first action should be to move up to get to the 'stop' rule.

Let's try to figure out what I need to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. I'm controlling Baba since baba is you.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. The door, which is the win object, is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's a wall blocking the path to the door. The key might be needed to open the door, but I'm not sure if that's the case in this game yet. 

First, I need to reach the key. The key is located at 7 steps right and 1 step up from my current position. Wait, where exactly am I? The rules and objects are positioned relative to other things. The rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. So, if I'm at that position, I need to move right towards the key. 

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 3 steps right. So, moving right directly might hit a wall. Hmm. The key is 7 steps to the right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Maybe I need to find a way around the wall. Let me check the map again. 

The wall at 3 steps right is a stop, so I can't push past it. Maybe I need to move up or down to get around. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I move up from my current position (2 left, 3 down), moving up one step would put me at 2 left, 2 down. Then, moving right towards the key. Wait, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So, maybe I need to move up more. 

Wait, the rule `key` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. But relative to where? Maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinates. Let me parse the object positions again. 

The rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So, if I'm at that position, moving right would be towards the wall at 3 steps right. But the key is at 7 steps right, which is way further. There must be a path. Let's see: 

The wall at 3 steps right is a stop. So, I can't move through it. Maybe I can move around it by going up or down. The key is 1 step up from 7 steps right. So, if I can reach 7 steps right and 1 step up, that's where the key is. 

But how to get there without hitting the wall at 3 steps right. Maybe moving up first. From my current position (2 left, 3 down), moving up once would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Then, can I move right? There's a wall at 3 steps right, so moving right from 2 left would be towards 3 steps right. But that's a stop. So, can't go there. 

Alternatively, maybe moving down. From 3 steps down, moving down more would take me to 4 steps down, but there's a wall there too. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to push the wall? But the wall is defined as stop, so I can't move it unless I change the rule. The current rules are wall is stop, so unless I can change that, I can't push walls. 

Another approach: Maybe the key isn't required to win. The door is the win object, and the rule says door is win. So, if I can reach the door without the key, maybe that's the way. But the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Let's see the path. From my current position (2 left, 3 down), moving right towards the door. 

But between me and the door, there's a wall at 3 steps right. So, moving right once gets me to 1 left, 3 down. Then, moving right again would hit the wall at 3 steps right. So, stuck again. 

Hmm. So maybe I need the key to unlock the door. But how? In Baba Is You, sometimes you need to push objects or use text blocks to change rules. For example, if there's a ""key is win"" rule, then picking up the key would make you win. But in this case, the active rule is door is win. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `key` at 1 step right and 2 steps down. That might be a text block that says ""key is ..."". But the current active rule is door is win. So, unless I can change the rule to make key win, picking up the key won't help. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the rule `door` is win to somewhere else, making the door not the win object. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. For example, if I can move the ""door is win"" rule away, then maybe another object becomes win. 

But how do I move the text blocks? I have to be a ""you"" object, which I am (baba is you). So, I can push other objects that aren't stop. The walls are stop, so I can't push them. The key and other rules might be movable. 

Looking at the objects, the rule `key` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. That's a text block, so if I can push it, maybe I can place it somewhere else. But to do that, I need to move towards it. 

Let me try to map out my position. The rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. Suppose my position is (0,0). Then, the rule `baba` is at (-2, -3). The rule `is` is at (-1, -3), and `you` is at (3, -3) wait, no. Wait, the positions are relative. 

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on relative movements. The key is 7 steps to the right and 1 step up from somewhere. But I think the key's position is relative to the rule blocks. Alternatively, maybe the key is at a specific coordinate on the grid. 

Alternatively, think of each object's position in terms of steps from the player. If the player is at position (0,0), then objects are located at certain steps relative to that. For example, the rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up would be at (-2, 3). 

But I'm not sure. Maybe the key is located at a position I can reach by moving right and up, avoiding the walls. Let's try to navigate step by step. 

Current position: Assume I'm at the rule `baba` position, which is 2 step left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe from the center. But this is unclear. 

Alternatively, consider that to move up, I can go towards the rules above. The active rules are at various positions. The ""wall is stop"" rule is 2 step left and 3 step up from my position. So, moving up three steps would reach that rule. 

But perhaps the best approach is to move towards the key. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move right and up, avoiding the walls. Let's see:

From my current position (let's assume it's at the start), moving right once takes me to 1 step right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So, moving right twice would get to 2 steps right, which is clear. Then, moving right again to 3 steps right is blocked by the wall. 

Alternatively, move up first. From my position, moving up once gets me to a position where I can then move right. 

Wait, the key is 1 step up from 7 steps right. So, if I can get to 7 steps right, 1 step up, that's where the key is. 

But how to get there without hitting the wall at 3 steps right. Maybe move up, then right, then down? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to push the wall by changing the rules. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move through it. To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is located at 2 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that text block, I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing me to pass through walls. 

To move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push it if it's not stopped. But the rule says wall is stop, so the text block ""wall"" is stop. Wait, the text blocks themselves might have properties. The ""wall"" text block is stop, meaning I can't push it? Or does the rule ""wall is stop"" mean that any object named wall is stop? 

This is a bit unclear. In Baba Is You, when a text block is set to stop, that object can't be moved. So, if the ""wall"" text block is defined as stop, then I can't push it. But the ""wall is stop"" rule is a separate text block that says that any wall is stop. 

So, to move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it, provided that it's not stopped. But since the rule is ""wall is stop"", it's possible that the rule itself isn't stopped unless there's another rule making it stop. 

Looking at the active rules, ""wall is stop"" is a rule, and ""baba is you"" is another. So, the ""wall is stop"" rule isn't stopped by anything, so I should be able to push it. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is located at 2 step left and 3 step up from my position. So, if I move left and up to reach that rule, then push it in a direction, I can move it elsewhere. For example, move left to get next to it, then push it right or left. 

But I need to navigate to that rule's position. From my current position (assuming it's at the ""baba"" rule), moving left would take me towards the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. So, if I move left, that's further away. Alternatively, maybe I need to move up first. 

This is getting a bit too convoluted. Maybe I should try to move towards the key directly. Let's see:

The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move right 7 times and up 1 time, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So, after moving right 2 steps (avoiding the wall), then up, then right again. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the door can be made into a key by rewriting the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule (if it exists) to make door be win, but in the current active rules, door is already win. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 8 steps right and 2 step up. That's part of the ""door is win"" rule. So, the ""door is win"" rule is made up of the text blocks ""door"", ""is"", and ""win"" placed adjacent to each other. 

If I can move those text blocks, I can change the rule. For example, if I move the ""win"" text block to be next to ""baba"", then ""baba is win"" would make me win. 

But to do that, I need to navigate to those text blocks. The ""door is win"" rule is at positions: rule `door` 6 steps right and 2 step up, rule `is` 7 steps right and 2 step up, rule `win` 8 steps right and 2 step up. 

So, those three text blocks are in a row. If I can break that rule by moving one of them, then door is no longer win. But since I'm you, maybe I can push them. 

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"", then I would win immediately. To do that, I need to place ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" in a row. 

My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 step left and 3 steps down. So, the ""baba"" text block is there. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to it, I can create ""baba is win"". 

The ""is"" text block is at 1 step left and 3 steps down (same as the ""baba"" rule's position?), or wait, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down from where? This is confusing without knowing the exact grid layout. 

Alternatively, think that each rule's position is relative to the previous one. For example, the ""door is win"" rule has ""door"" at 6 steps right and 2 step up, then ""is"" at 7 steps right and 2 step up, then ""win"" at 8 steps right and 2 step up. So, they're all in a horizontal line to the right. 

To create ""baba is win"", I need to get the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to the ""baba"" text block. The ""is"" text block is currently at 1 step to the left and 1 step down from the ""baba"" rule. Wait, no, the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down from where? The original observation says:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down
rule `you` 3 steps down

So, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 left, 1 down. Then the ""is"" rule is 1 left, 1 down. Then the ""you"" rule is directly below the ""is"" at 3 steps down. 

So, the ""baba"" text block is at 2 left, 1 down. The ""is"" is adjacent to it on the left. To make ""baba is win"", I need to get the ""win"" text block next to the ""is"". The current ""win"" is part of the ""door is win"" rule at 8 steps right and 2 step up. 

This seems quite involved. Maybe the quickest way is to push the ""win"" text block from the ""door is win"" rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"". 

To do that, I need to move to the ""win"" text block's position, which is 8 steps right and 2 step up from the ""door"" text block. But how to get there? There are walls blocking the path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the entire ""door is win"" rule to a new location. For example, push the ""door"" text block left, which would move the entire rule. 

But again, the walls are in the way. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on moving the key first. 

The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. If I can reach there, maybe I can then use it to open the door. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the door can be pushed. If the door is not stopped, I can push it. But the rule says wall is stop, but door isn't a wall. So, if there's no rule saying door is stop, I can push it. 

The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. If I can push it towards the win area (which it already is), but that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, if I can make the door into a you object, then stepping on it would make me win. To do that, create a rule ""door is you"". But to do that, I need to move the necessary text blocks. 

This is really challenging. Maybe the best approach is to try to move the ""win"" text block from the ""door is win"" rule and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"". 

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" text block at 8 steps right and 2 step up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So, how to get past that? 

Unless I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule away, then the walls are no longer stop, and I can push through them. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So, if I can move that rule, I can remove the stop property from walls. 

To move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm you, I should be able to push it if it's not stopped. But the rule itself isn't stopped; the walls are stopped because of the rule. 

So, moving the ""wall is stop"" rule would just move that specific text block, not the property. So, if I move the ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else, the property of walls being stop would still exist unless another rule defines it. Wait, no. The rule ""wall is stop"" creates the property that any wall is stop. If I remove that rule by moving it away, then walls would no longer be stop. 

Yes, that's right. So, if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule off the board, then walls are no longer stop, and I can push them or move through them. 

So, the plan is: move the ""wall is stop"" rule away. To do that, navigate to its position, which is 2 step left and 3 step up from my current position. 

My current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 step left and 1 step down. So, the ""wall is stop"" rule is 2 step left and 3 step up from there. 

Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So, to get to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 step left and 3 step up, I need to move up twice from the ""baba"" rule's position. 

Let me break it down:

1. From ""baba"" (2 left, 1 down), move up once to reach 2 left, 0 down (or 2","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. That means I can move around unless there's a wall, and the door is the win condition. The goal is to reach the door, which is a win.

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a key at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a door at 6 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the direct path. The rule `key` is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to pick up the key first?

Wait, but how do I move the key? To move objects, I need to be adjacent to them and not hit a stop. The key is at 7 steps right, 1 step up. My position must be somewhere else. The rule `baba` is 2 steps left and 3 steps down from the rightmost wall. So I'm probably located around there. Let me try to visualize the layout.

The walls are all aligned to the right, 3 steps right from the starting point. The door is at 6 steps right, which is one step left of the wall. So maybe the door is just beyond the wall. The key is at 7 steps right, 1 step up, which is beyond the door. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, 1 step up. So to get to the key, I need to avoid those walls.

But right now, the active rules don't let me change anything except by moving text blocks. The key is defined as a win, but the door is also a win. So maybe I don't need the key. But the door is behind a wall. Wait, the rule `stop` is at 3 step up. So if I go up, I might hit a wall. 

Looking at the rule `baba` is you, so I can move as Baba. The goal is to reach the door. The door is at 6 steps right. From my position, which is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down, that would place me at 1 step left and 1 step up relative to the rightmost wall. So I'm somewhere in the lower left area. To get to the door at 6 steps right, I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path.

The wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, 2 step up, 3 step up, etc., suggests that the right side is blocked by walls from up to down. The door is at 6 steps right, which is one step left of the wall at 3 steps right. Wait, maybe the door is at 6 steps right, same as the wall? No, the door is at 6 steps right, and the wall is at 3 steps right. So the door is further to the right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so how do I get past that?

Wait, maybe the walls are arranged such that moving right from my position would hit the wall at 3 steps right. So I need to find another path. Looking at the objects, there's a key at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I need to get the key first to unlock something, but the key is a win condition. Or maybe the key is just an object that can be moved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the rules. For example, if I can move the ""door is win"" rule and make ""key is win"" instead, then getting the key would be the objective. But how? I need to move the text blocks that define the rules. The rule `door` is 6 steps right and 3 step up, paired with `is` and `win`. To change the win condition, I need to move the `win` rule elsewhere.

But to move those text blocks, they can't be stopped. The wall is a stop, so I need to avoid moving into walls. The rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 3 steps down from the rightmost wall. So my position is likely at (assuming the reference point is the rightmost wall at (3,0)), then 2 left would be (1,0), 3 down would be (1, -3). But the exact coordinates might vary. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is at a position I can reach. If I move right from my current position, passing through the walls? But walls are stop, so I can't. Hmm. Maybe I need to use the key to override a rule. For example, if I can make the key a stop, then I can use it to block something, but the active rules don't allow that unless I can move the text blocks.

Wait, the key's rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can move that `key` rule somewhere else, maybe I can change its property. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the `key` text block and move it without hitting a stop. The `key` block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. My position is at rule `baba` 2 step left and 3 steps down, which would place me at (1 - 2, 0 - 3) = (-1, -3) if the rightmost wall is at (3,0). That seems off. Maybe the coordinate system is relative.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to simplify. The main goal is to reach the door, which is a win. The door is at 6 steps right. The only way past the walls is to either move the walls or find a path around them. But since walls are stop, I can't move through them. Perhaps there's a way to make the door not a stop? But the active rule is door is win, not stop. So moving towards the door shouldn't be blocked by stop unless there's a wall in the way.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right at various ups and downs. So from my position, moving right would reach 3 steps right, which is a wall. So I can't go further right. But the door is at 6 steps right, which is beyond the walls. How is that possible? Maybe the walls are only at certain levels. For example, at 3 steps right, there's a wall at 4 step up, but lower levels might be clear.

Alternatively, maybe the layout is such that there's a path around the walls. If I move up or down from my current position, perhaps I can find a route to the door. Let's check the map again.

The rule `wall` is at 2 step left and 3 step up. The `is` is adjacent, then `stop` at 3 step up. So the wall at 3 step up is part of the stop rule. Then, moving down from there, there are walls at 2 step up, 1 step up, and so on. The door is at 6 steps right, which is to the right of the wall cluster. So maybe there's a way to get to the door by moving right past the walls, but the walls are solid.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is needed to unlock the door. Since the key is a win, maybe picking it up first allows me to use it to activate the door. But how? In Baba Is You, sometimes you need to push objects or use text blocks to change rules.

Wait, if I can move the `key` text block next to the door, maybe I can make a new rule like ""door is key"" or something, but the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. To create a new rule, I need to have the subject, ""is"", and the property. The key is already a win, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make myself (Baba) a key, then maybe I can win by touching the key. But the rule is ""baba is you"", so to become a key, I would need to change the rule to ""baba is key"" and ""key is you"". But that requires moving the text blocks.

Let me think. The `key` rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The `is` is at 7 steps right and 2 step up for the door's win rule. To create a new rule ""baba is key"", I need to move the `baba` text block, the `is` text block, and the `key` text block into the correct positions. But I'm currently at the `baba` rule's position. So if I move the `baba` rule to, say, where the door is, then pair it with `is` and `key`, that could work. But how to do that?

First, I need to move the `baba` rule. The `baba` rule is at 2 step left and 3 steps down from the rightmost wall. If I move left from there, but there's a wall at 2 step left and 3 step up. Wait, maybe not. The walls are at specific positions. This is getting too vague without a visual.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move down towards the door's location. The door is at 6 steps right, and I'm at 2 step left and 3 steps down. If I move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So moving right from my position (2 left of the rightmost wall) would be towards 1 step right, then 2, then 3 (which is a wall). So I can't get past 3 steps right. But the door is at 6 steps right. That's way beyond. There must be another way.

Wait, maybe the walls are only in certain directions. For example, the wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up is blocking the way up, but maybe moving down past the wall is possible. If I move down from my current position, perhaps I can find a path around the walls.

Looking at the objects, the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. The rule `key` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move the `key` rule to near the door to create a new rule. For example, moving the `key` rule next to the door and then creating ""door is key"" or something. But I need to be adjacent to the `key` text block to move it.

The `key` text block is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 step left and 3 steps down. So from my position, moving right once gets me to 1 step left of the rightmost wall. Then moving right again would hit the wall at 3 steps right. So I can't reach the `key` block directly. Unless there's a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can push other objects. But the key is a win, and doors are win. Maybe pushing the key towards the door. But to push, I need to be adjacent and move in the direction, but the key is likely a stop unless rules say otherwise. Wait, the active rules don't specify that key is stop, only that door is win and wall is stop. So maybe the key is movable.

If the key is not a stop, I can move it. The `key` rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The actual key object is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. So the text block for key is separate from the key object. To move the key object, I need to be adjacent to it and not hit a stop. The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. From my position, which is 2 step left and 3 steps down from the rightmost wall, moving right multiple times would get me to 3 steps right (a wall), so that's blocked. Moving up from my position: the rule `wall` is at 3 step up, so moving up would hit a wall. Moving down: perhaps I can move down towards the door's location.

If I move down from my current position, maybe I can reach the area where the door is. The door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. My position is, say, at (1, -3) if the rightmost wall is at (3,0). Moving down would take me to (1, -4), but I need to see if there's a path. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So if I can get to 6 steps right and 1 step down (the door), but how?

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the `you` rule. Since I'm Baba and the rule is ""baba is you"", if I can move the `you` text block next to the door, making ""door is you"", then touching the door would make me win. But how to do that?

The `you` rule is at 3 steps down. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is near the `baba` rule. Maybe I can move the `baba` rule, then the `is` rule, and the `you` rule to form a new rule. For example, moving `baba` to where the door is, then `is`, then `you`, creating ""door is you"". That way, touching the door would make me you, and since door is win, I win.

To do that, I need to navigate to the door's location, but there are walls blocking the way. Alternatively, move the text blocks telepathically by moving them one by one. But each move requires being adjacent to the text block.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Move the `you` rule from 3 steps down to near the door.
2. To do that, I need to move it step by step. But my current position is at the `baba` rule. So first, maybe move the `baba` rule to a nearby spot, then the `is` rule, then the `you` rule.

Alternatively, since the `you` rule is at 3 steps down, and I'm at 2 steps left and 3 steps down from the rightmost wall, moving left from my position might get me to the `you` rule. But there's a wall at 2 step left and 3 step up. Wait, this is getting too confusing without a visual map.

Another approach: Since the key is a win, maybe just grab the key and then go to the door. But how to get the key? The key is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. From my position, moving right would hit the wall at 3 steps right. So perhaps I need to move up to a position where I can get around the walls.

If I move up from my current position, but there's a wall at 3 step up. So that's blocked. Moving down: perhaps there's a path. If I move down a few steps, maybe I can reach the area near the door without hitting walls.

Looking at the objects, the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So the door is one step left of that wall. Maybe I can push the wall aside by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move through it. But the rule is ""wall is stop"", so changing that would require moving the `wall` or `stop` text blocks.

The `wall` rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. The `stop` rule is at 3 step up. To make wall not a stop, I need to move either the `wall` rule or the `stop` rule. For example, moving the `stop` rule to a different location, so that wall is no longer associated with stop.

If I can move the `stop` rule away from the wall, then the wall might not be a stop anymore. The `stop` rule is at 3 step up, adjacent to the `wall` rule. So if I move the `stop` rule to another position, like next to the door, then walls might not block movement.

But how to move the `stop` rule? I need to be adjacent to it. The `stop` rule is at 3 step up, which is in the upper part of the map. My current position is lower down, so moving up there would require passing through walls. For example, from my position at 2 step left and 3 steps down, moving up 3 steps would get me to 3 step up, but there's a wall blocking that path.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move down towards the door's location, avoiding the walls by moving around them. For instance, moving down from my current position, then right past the wall at 3 steps right.

Wait, the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. My position is, let's assume, at (1, -3) relative to the rightmost wall at (3,0). Moving down to (1, -4), then right to (2, -4), (3, -4) which is a wall. So that's blocked. Alternatively, moving up first, but there's a wall at 3 step up.

Another idea: Use the key to create a new rule. If I can move the `key` text block next to the door and make a rule like ""door is key"", then touching the door would be equivalent to touching the key, which is a win. But the key is already a win, so that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make the door a key, then touching it would be a win. But the active rule is ""door is win"", so changing that would require moving the `door` or `win` text blocks.

The `door` rule is at 6 steps right and 3 step up, paired with `is` and `win`. To change it to ""door is key"", I need to move the `win` rule to another location and replace it with `key`. But how?

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move down towards the door's location and see if I can find a path. Given that the previous actions were down and up, perhaps the correct action now is to continue moving down to approach the door.

So, the chosen action is down.

Let's try to figure out what I need to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba because of ""baba is you,"" and walls are stoppable. The goal is to get to the door, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 7 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, but the door is at 6 steps to the right. Hmm. Maybe I need to get the key first? But how do I reach the key? The key is probably behind some walls that are stopping me. Let me check the positions.

The rule 'key' is located 1 step to the right and 1 step down from the wall. The wall is at 3 steps right and right step down. So the key is at (assuming my position is somewhere else) maybe I need to move down to reach it. But wait, I'm Baba. My position might be at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down. Let me parse that.

The rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down from where? Maybe from the current position. Suppose I'm at position (x, y). The rule says rule `baba` is 2 left and 1 down. So my actual position would be 2 steps right and 1 step up from that rule. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the immediate surroundings.

The active rules are wall stops, door is win, and I'm Baba. So I can move unless I hit a wall. The key is at 7 right, 1 up. The door is at 6 right. So maybe I can move right towards the door. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the key is at 7 right and 1 up. So from my current position, which is rule `baba` 2 left and 1 down, if I'm 2 right and 1 up from that rule's position, where is that rule located?

Alternatively, maybe I need to look at the positions relative to each other. Let's list all the positions:

- rule `wall` is at 2 left, 4 up from somewhere.
- rule `is` is 1 left, 4 up.
- rule `stop` is 4 up.
- wall at 3 right, 4 up.
- rule `door` at 6 right, 4 up.
- rule `is` again at 7 right, 4 up.
- rule `win` at 8 right, 4 up.
- walls at 3 right, 3 up; 2 up; 1 up; door at 6 right, 1 up; key at 7 right, 2 up; wall at 3 right, 1 down; rule `baba` at 2 left, 1 down; rule `is` at 1 left, 1 down; rule `you` at 1 down; walls further down.

Assuming I'm the Baba entity, my position is where the rule `baba` is located, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down from where? Maybe from the 'is' rule. Wait, the rule `baba` is 2 left and 1 down from the rule `is` at 1 left and 1 down. So if the rule `is` is at (x, y), then rule `baba` is at (x - 2, y - 1). But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on movement.

The goal is to reach the door at 6 right. Current position of the door is 6 steps to the right. If I can move right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, looking at the objects:

- wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up.
- door at 6 steps right and 1 step up.
- key at 7 steps right and 2 step up.
- wall at 3 steps right and 3 step down.

So maybe the path to the door is blocked by walls. But perhaps I can push objects? Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move text blocks to change rules. So maybe the solution involves moving the 'key' rule or other rules to create a new path.

Alternatively, since the key is at 7 right, 1 up, and I need to get there. Let's see: from my current position (assuming I'm at rule `baba`'s location), which is 2 left and 1 down from the rule `is` at 1 left and 1 down. So if the rule `is` is at position (x, y), then rule `baba` is at (x-2, y-1). If the rule `is` is at 1 step left and 1 down from wherever, this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for movable objects.

The key is a text block with 'key is win' somewhere. But currently, door is win. Maybe if I can make 'key is win' and then get the key, but the key is behind a wall. Alternatively, push a wall aside? But walls are 'stop', so they can't be moved unless their rule is changed.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So to move a wall, I need to change the 'wall is stop' rule. For example, if I can move the 'stop' rule to somewhere else, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Or maybe create a 'door is stop' rule to block the door, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, make 'baba is win' so that just being Baba makes me win. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule to be under 'baba'. The current 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left and 1 down. Maybe moving the 'win' rule to be adjacent to 'baba'?

But to move a rule, I have to be next to it and move it in a direction. Let's see where the 'win' rule is. It's at 8 steps right and 4 up from the starting point. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left and 1 down. So maybe I need to move the 'win' rule towards the 'baba' rule.

But how do I reach the 'win' rule? It's located at 8 right, 4 up. There are walls blocking the way. For example, at 3 steps right and 4 up is a wall. So to get to the 'win' rule, I might need to push that wall aside, but walls are stop. Unless I can change the 'wall is stop' rule.

Alternatively, create a 'key is you' so that I can pick up the key and carry it. But to do that, I need to move the 'you' rule to the 'key' text block. The current 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. The key is at 7 right, 2 up. So maybe move the 'you' rule to the key's position.

But to move the 'you' rule, I have to be adjacent to it and move it. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down, which is likely near the bottom of the map. My position is at rule `baba` which is 2 left and 1 down from the 'is' rule. If the 'is' rule is at 1 left and 1 down, then 'baba' is at 1 left -2 = -1 left and 1 down -1 = 0 down? Not sure. Maybe I need to move down to reach the 'you' rule.

Looking at the current observation, after moving down several times, the 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. So if I keep moving down, I can get to the 'you' rule. Once there, I can move it to the key's position. Then, if key is you, I can pick up the key and carry it to the door. Then, since door is win, touching it would win.

Alternatively, make 'baba is win' by moving the 'win' rule to 'baba'. But that requires getting to the 'win' rule at 8 right, 4 up, which is blocked by walls.

Another approach: use the key to unlock the door. But in Baba Is You, keys usually unlock doors, but that's a standard puzzle mechanic. However, in this level, the door is a win condition, so maybe having the key isn't necessary. But the key is probably there for a reason.

Wait, the current active rules are door is win, so touching the door wins. But there's a wall between me and the door. The door is at 6 steps right, and there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe I need to move the wall aside. But walls are stop, so unless I can change their property.

To change a wall's property, I need to manipulate the 'wall is stop' rule. For example, move the 'stop' rule elsewhere so that walls are no longer stop. Then I can move through them. So the plan would be: move the 'stop' rule away from the wall, making walls passable.

The 'stop' rule is currently at 3 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule to a different position, say next to a different object, then walls would not be stop anymore. To move the 'stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. Where is that located?

Looking at the objects:

- rule `stop` is at 3 step up. The rule `wall` is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So the 'stop' rule is one step to the right of the 'wall' rule. So if I can get to the 'stop' rule, which is at 3 step up, and move it, maybe left or right.

Assuming I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 2 left and 1 down from the 'is' rule at 1 left and 1 down. So my position is (1 left -2) = -1 left and (1 down -1) = 0 down. That seems odd. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point. This is getting too confusing without a visual.

Alternatively, think of the map grid. Let's assume the player (Baba) is near the bottom. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. So if I move down, I can reach it. Once there, I can move the 'you' rule to the key's location. Then, if key is you, I can move the key and take it to the door. Then, door is win.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to be under 'baba', making Baba the win condition. But that requires reaching the 'win' rule at 8 right, 4 up, which is blocked by walls.

Another possibility: push a wall using another object. But in Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not defined as 'stop'. Since walls are stop, you can't push them. But maybe if you change the 'wall is stop' rule, then you can push walls.

So steps could be:

1. Move the 'stop' rule away from the wall so walls are no longer stop.
2. Then push walls out of the way to reach the door or key.

But how to move the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. If I can get to the 'stop' rule, which is near the top of the map, maybe by moving up.

Looking at the current position of the 'baba' rule: it's at 2 left and 1 down. The 'is' rule is at 1 left and 1 down. So the 'baba' rule is to the left of the 'is' rule. To get to the 'stop' rule at 3 step up, I need to move up from my current position.

But how high can I move? There are walls at 3 steps right and 2 step up, 1 step up, etc. Maybe I can move up through the grid, avoiding walls.

Alternatively, use the key to unlock something. But I don't have the key yet.

Alternatively, create a 'you' rule on Baba so that I can move him. But he's already 'baba is you', so that's set.

This is tricky. Maybe the immediate action is to move down towards the 'you' rule to manipulate it. Let's see: the previous action was 'down', and the observation didn't change much. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. If I keep moving down, I might reach it.

But in the last observation, after moving down, the position of 'rule `baba`' is 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe moving down again would get me closer to the 'you' rule at 3 steps down.

Alternatively, move left or right to reach adjacent rules. Let's see: the 'key' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left and 1 down. So if I move right twice, I can get to the 'key' rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So maybe I can't get there directly.

Wait, the 'key' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from where? If the 'key' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down from the wall at 3 steps right, then it's at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. But the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. This is getting too confusing without knowing the exact map layout.

Perhaps the best action is to move down towards the 'you' rule to manipulate it and then move it to the key or door. Alternatively, try to move the 'win' rule to Baba.

But given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the next logical step is to continue moving down to reach the 'you' rule. Once there, I can move the 'you' rule to the key's position, making the key controllable, then pick it up and go to the door.

So the action would be down again.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are wall is stop and door is win, with baba is you. The objects on the map include various walls, doors, and keys arranged in specific positions.

First, I need to understand the player's position and the layout. From the observation, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down. The door, which is the win condition, is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. So the key is below the door. But there might be walls blocking the path.

The player is likely represented by Baba. To get to the door, I need to navigate around the walls. The key is necessary maybe to unlock something, but since the current win condition is the door, perhaps grabbing the key isn't mandatory unless there's a rule change needed.

Looking at the rules, door is win, so reaching the door would win the level. But there might be walls blocking the direct path. Let's check the positions:

- The key is at 5 right, 3 down. The door is at 5 right, 1 down. So moving down from the key would reach the door. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Also, there's a wall at 4 right, 2 down. So the path from the key to the door might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe moving left from the key could reach the door. But the door's position is 5 right, 1 down. If the key is at 5 right, 3 down, moving left would be towards 4 or 3 steps right. However, there's a wall at 4 right, 2 down, which might be in the way.

Another approach: check if there are any movable text blocks. For example, the ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"" might be a text block that can be moved to create a new rule. If I can move ""key IS WIN"" or something else, that could change the win condition. But currently, the win condition is door.

Wait, the current active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So to win, reach the door. But if there's a wall blocking the path, I need to move around it. Maybe the key isn't needed here. Let's check the obstacles.

Looking at the map details:

- At 4 steps right and 3 steps down: wall.
- At 4 right, 2 down: wall.
- The key is at 5 right, 3 down. So if I'm at the key's position, moving down would hit the wall at 4 right, 3 down. That's blocked. Moving left from the key would take me to 4 right, 3 down, which is a wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at a different position. Let me recheck. The player is Baba, whose rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down, and rule `is` is at 1 step left and 3 steps down. So Baba's position might be derived from those rules. This part is a bit confusing. Maybe the player is located near the ""baba is you"" rule.

Assuming the player is near the baba rule, perhaps moving down from there could lead to the key or door. The key is at 5 right, 3 down. If the player is at 2 left and 3 down, moving right 5 steps would get to the key, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 4 right, 3 up, there's a wall. So pathfinding is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the solution involves manipulating the rules. For instance, if I can make the key a win, then grabbing the key would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""key IS WIN"" text block. The current ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 step up. So if I can swap the ""win"" rule with the key's position, that might work.

But to move the text blocks, they can't be STOP. Looking at the active rules, wall is stop, so any wall can't be moved. The key's rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which isn't a stop, so it can be moved. Similarly, the ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 2 up, which isn't a stop, so it can be moved.

So the plan could be: move the ""win"" rule to the key's location, then go get the key, which would then be the win condition. Alternatively, move the key's rule to become ""key IS YOU"", making the key interactable, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the door is the win condition, but perhaps it's behind a wall. If I can move a wall rule somewhere else to clear a path. For example, if there's a ""wall IS STOP"" rule, maybe moving it away would let me pass through a wall. But the wall rules are fixed in their positions unless moved.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. The text blocks for these rules are located at specific positions. To change a rule, I need to move its text block. For example, to make wall not stop, I could move the ""wall IS STOP"" rule to a different position, effectively removing it. But that might not be safe because other rules depend on it.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""key IS WIN"" by moving the ""win"" rule to the key's position. Let's see: the ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 2 up. The key is at 7 right and 1 up. So moving the ""win"" rule down to the key's location (7 right, 1 up) would make key IS WIN. Then, going to the key would win the level.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? The player (Baba) needs to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule text block and then move in the direction while carrying the rule. Since the rule blocks are objects that can be moved if they're not STOP. The ""win"" rule's position is 8 right and 2 up. To reach there, the player would have to navigate through the grid, avoiding walls.

Alternatively, maybe the player is already near the ""win"" rule. If I can move down from the current position to reach the ""win"" rule, then move it to the key's location. But the path might be blocked by walls. For example, from the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 2 up, moving down to 8 right, 1 up (where the key is at 7 right, 1 up) might not be straightforward.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach door (win) or find a way to bypass it by changing rules.
- Possible solution: Make key the win by moving ""win"" rule to key's position.
- Steps needed: Navigate to ""win"" rule, move it to key's location, then go to key.

But how to get to the ""win"" rule? The ""win"" rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The player's position is likely near the ""baba is you"" rule, which is at 2 left and 3 down. So moving right and up from there.

Assuming the player is at position (0,0) for simplicity, the ""win"" rule is at (8,2). There are walls at various positions that might block the path. For example, at (4,3), (4,2), etc. So need to find a path around these.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the way to unlock the door. If the key is at (7,3), and the door is at (5,1), perhaps moving down from the key to the door, but blocked by walls. Maybe pushing a wall aside by moving into it, but walls are STOP, so you can't push them.

Another thought: If I can make the door not a stop, then maybe walk through it. But door is win, so it's passable. Wait, the rule is door is win, which means reaching it wins. But if there's a wall in front of it, you can't go through. Unless the wall is somehow removed.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""door IS YOU"", making Baba the door, but that might not help unless the door is a YOU object.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the ""door IS WIN"" rule to a different position, effectively removing it, and then create a new rule that makes something else win. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the key is present, maybe pick it up and use it somewhere. But the current rules don't mention a key's property. If I can make the key a tool to remove walls, like ""key IS PUSH"" or ""key ISStop"", but that requires moving text blocks.

Wait, the ""key"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So if I can move that ""key IS [something]"" rule. For example, changing ""key IS WIN"" by moving the ""win"" rule to the key's position.

But to do that, the player needs to carry the ""win"" rule text block to the key's location. Let's say the player is near the ""win"" rule. If they move down from the ""win"" rule's position (8 right, 2 up) to 8 right, 1 up (where the key's rule is at 1 right, 2 down?), maybe that's not adjacent. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the immediate action is to move towards the key or the door, trying to navigate around the walls. For example, if the player is at position (2 left, 3 down), moving right towards the door and key area, avoiding walls.

But given the previous failed attempts and the environment resetting when breaking a rule, maybe the correct approach is to manipulate the rules. Let's try to move the ""win"" rule to the key's position.

To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule text block. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 2 step up. The player's position, based on the ""baba"" rule at 2 step left and 3 steps down, might be a few steps away. So moving right and up to reach the ""win"" rule.

Once adjacent, move in the direction of the key's location. For example, move the ""win"" rule down to 8 right, 3 down (but the key is at 7 right, 1 up). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""key"" rule to become ""key IS WIN"". The ""key"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down. So if the player moves the ""key"" rule text block to a position where it says ""key IS WIN"", that would change the win condition.

But how to do that? The player would need to move the ""key"" rule's text block. For example, if the ""key"" rule is at (1,2), and the player moves it down to (1,3), then writes ""key IS WIN"" there. But the action would require picking up the ""key"" rule and placing it with the new property.

This is getting too abstract. Given the time constraints and previous failed attempts, perhaps the best immediate action is to move towards the key or door, navigating around walls. Let's check the latest observation:

Current Observation after environment reset:
Active rules: wall is stop, door is win, baba is you.
Key is at 5 right, 3 down. Door at 5 right, 1 down. Player (Baba) is near the ""baba is you"" rule at 2 left and 3 down.

So the player is likely at position (2 left, 3 down). To reach the key at (5 right, 3 down), the player needs to move right 7 steps, but there's a wall at 4 right, 3 down. So can't go directly right. Maybe move up first to avoid the wall.

For example, move up from (2 left, 3 down) to (2 left, 2 down), then right to (3 left, 2 down), then right again, avoiding walls. But this requires knowing the exact layout.

Alternatively, move down from the current position to (2 left, 4 down), but not sure if that's helpful.

Another angle: Since the key is below the door, maybe picking up the key allows traversing through walls. But the current rules don't indicate that. Unless ""key IS PUSH"" or similar, but that's not active.

Given the previous failures, perhaps the solution is to move the ""win"" rule to the key's location. To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to the ""win"" rule at 8 right, 2 up. From the player's position at 2 left, 3 down, moving right and up: right 10 steps to 8 right, then up 2 steps to 2 up. But there are walls along the way, like at 4 right, 3 up (wall), 4 right, 2 up (wall), etc. So pathfinding is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""door IS WIN"" rule to the key's position. The ""door"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. Moving it down to 6 right, 1 up (where the door is) doesn't help. Alternatively, moving the ""win"" rule from 8 right, 2 up to 7 right, 1 up (key's position). That would require moving the ""win"" rule text block down-left.

Assuming the player can reach the ""win"" rule, then move it left and down to the key's location. Once done, the key becomes the win condition, and picking it up would win.

But how to execute this in actions? The player needs to navigate to the ""win"" rule, then move it. Each move would involve actions like right, up, etc.

Given the complexity and time spent, perhaps the best next action is to move right towards the key area, trying to navigate around the walls. For example, from the player's position (assuming it's near the ""baba is you"" rule), move right to start heading towards the key.

So the chosen action would be ""right"".

I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. Let's look at the current observation again.

The active rules are still wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. That means I can move around unless there's a wall (which stops me), and I need to reach the door to win. But Wait, there's a key on the map. Maybe I need to pick up the key first? Let me check the objects.

Looking at the objects, there's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. I need to get to that key, but how? Let's see the positions. The player (Baba) seems to be nearby. The rule ""you"" is at 2 steps down, which I assume is attached to Baba since baba is you. So I'm at 2 steps down.

The walls are all aligned to the right. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up. So the path to the door is blocked. Maybe I need to move the wall rule or create a new rule to change that.

But first, the key. The key is at 4 steps right and 3 down. Let's see the path. From my current position (2 steps down), moving down to 3 steps down would get me to the key. But the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again.

The rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if Baba is at that position, then moving right would take me towards the right side. The key is at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. So from my current position (2 steps down), moving down once gets me to 3 steps down. Then, how many steps to the right? The key is 4 steps right, but the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. Let me check the walls.

There's a wall at 3 steps right, and another at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So moving right from my current position (which is rule `you` at 2 steps down) would take me to 1 step right, then 2, then 3. But the wall is at 3 steps right, so I can't go past that. Hmm, unless I can move the wall rule.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to push the wall rule out of the way. The wall rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can remove the wall blocking the path. But how?

To move a text block, I have to be next to it and it's not defined as stop. Let's see. The rule `wall` is 2 steps left and 3 steps up from where? Maybe relative to Baba's position. If I'm at 2 steps down and the rule `wall` is 2 steps left and 3 steps up, that would place the wall rule at (Baba's x -2, Baba's y +3). So if I move towards that rule, I can potentially push it.

But first, can I get to that rule? Let's think. From my current position (Baba at 2 step left and 2 steps down), moving left would take me to the rule `wall` which is 2 steps left and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. The rule `wall` is 2 step to the left and 3 step up from the current position. So if I move left twice and up three times, I reach the rule `wall`. But are there any stops in the way?

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So if I move up from my current position (2 steps down), moving up three steps would get me to 3 steps up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, but if I'm moving left from my position, which is 2 steps left and 2 steps down, moving left two more steps would be 4 steps left, and up three steps to 5 steps up. But the rule `wall` is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the immediate goal: get the key to maybe unlock the door or remove a stop. Alternatively, manipulate the rules to become the key or door.

But the door is win, so if I can make myself a door, then I could win by touching it. Or make the door a you, so I can move into it. Alternatively, change the stop property.

Wait, the current rules: wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So walls stop me, door is the win condition. To win, I need to reach the door. But there's a wall blocking the path. The wall is at 3 steps right and 3 step up. If I can remove that wall by moving its rule, that would help.

The rule `wall` is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So if I move that rule away, the wall would no longer be there. Let me try to reach that rule. From my current position (Baba's position is at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down?), wait no. The rule `baba` is located at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if that's the position of the ""baba is you"" rule, then Baba's actual position is somewhere else. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the rules. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the key first. The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. From my current position (which is at rule `you` 2 steps down), moving down once gets me to 3 steps down. Then, how many steps right? The key is 4 steps right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So I can't go past that. Unless I can move the wall rule.

The wall rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So if I can move that rule to the right, the wall would be repositioned, possibly removing the obstacle.

To move the rule `wall`, I need to be adjacent to it and it's not a stop. The wall rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps up from where? From Baba's position, I think. So if I move left twice and up three times, I reach the rule `wall`. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the rule `wall` by moving towards it. Let's see. If I move left from my current position (Baba at 2 step left and 2 steps down), moving left once gets me to 1 step left. Then left again to 0 steps left (same x as the starting point). Then up three times: from 2 steps down to 5 steps down? Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. The door is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. The wall blocking the door is at 3 steps right and 3 step up. If I can remove that wall by moving its rule, which is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So from Baba's current position, moving left twice and up three times would reach the rule `wall`. But is that possible without hitting other walls?

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. If I move up three steps from my current position (2 steps down), I'd be at 5 steps down. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the top-left corner. This is tricky without seeing the actual grid.

Alternatively, focus on moving the rule `wall` to eliminate the blocking wall. If I can move the rule `wall` from its current position (2 left, 3 up) to somewhere else, like next to the blocking wall, then the wall might no longer block the path.

But how to move the rule `wall`? I need to be adjacent to it. Let's assume that the rule `wall` is located 2 steps to the left and 3 steps up from Baba's position. So if I move left twice and up three times, I can get to the rule `wall`. But along the way, are there any stop properties?

From Baba's position (at the `you` rule, 2 steps down), moving left twice would place me at, say, position (x-2, y). Then moving up three times would be (x-2, y+3). Is there a wall there? The rule `wall` is there, but it's a text block, so if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. Wait, the rule `wall` is a text block that says ""wall is stop"", so the actual wall objects are instances of the wall rule. The text blocks themselves aren't stopped unless they have a stop property. But in this case, the rule `wall` is a text block, and the rule says ""wall is stop"", meaning any object named wall is stopped. So the text block ""wall is stop"" can be moved unless there's another rule making it stop.

But looking at the active rules, wall is stop, so the text block ""wall is stop"" itself isn't stopped unless there's a specific rule. Wait, no. The rules define properties. The text block ""wall is stop"" is a rule, and unless there's a rule saying ""rule is stop"" or something, it's movable. So I should be able to move the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So, the plan is: move to the ""wall is stop"" rule, then move it away to eliminate the wall blocking the door. Then go to the door. But how to do that step by step.

Current position: Assuming Baba is at the position of the ""you"" rule, which is 2 steps down. Let's say I need to go left twice and up three times to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. But along the way, are there any stops? The walls are at 3 steps right and such, but those are instances of the wall rule. The text blocks like ""wall is stop"" are separate and movable.

So, moving left from the ""you"" rule (2 steps down) once to 1 step left, then left again to 0 steps left. Then up three times: from 2 steps down to 5 steps down. But I need to check if there are any walls in the way. The walls are at 3 steps right and various positions, but since I'm moving left, I shouldn't hit them. So movement left twice and up three times should reach the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once there, I can move the rule either left, right, up, or down. If I move it to the position of the blocking wall (3 steps right and 3 step up), then the wall instance there would no longer exist if the rule is moved. Alternatively, moving the rule ""wall is stop"" to a different location so that the wall isn't where it's blocking.

But the goal is to remove the wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule away, then that wall instance would no longer exist. So moving the rule ""wall is stop"" to, say, 1 step right and 3 step up would mean the wall rule is now there, but the original wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up would be gone.

Once the blocking wall is removed, I can go right to the door at 6 steps right and 3 step up. But I need to get past the other walls. Alternatively, after removing the blocking wall, move right past the other walls.

Alternatively, maybe creating a new rule to become the door. For example, ""baba is door"", which would make me a win condition. Then touching the door (or any door) would win. But how to create that rule.

To create a new rule, I need to have the ""is"" text block nearby. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up from the ""wall is stop"" rule. So if I can move the ""is"" rule next to Baba and the ""baba"" rule, I can create ""baba is door"".

But first, let's focus on removing the blocking wall. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""wall is stop"" rule away from its current position.
3. Move to the door.

But how to execute this in actions.

Current position: Let's assume the ""you"" rule is at (x, y), so Baba is there. To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, I need to move left twice and up three times. Each move is a single step. So:

- Action: left (twice)
- Action: up (three times)

But I have to make sure there are no stops in between. Since the walls are at 3 steps right, which is in the opposite direction, moving left should be clear.

Once at the ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move it. Let's say I move it to the right. So action: right. Then the rule ""wall is stop"" is now at 1 step left and 3 steps up. This removes the wall instance at 3 steps right and 3 step up, because the rule defining walls has moved.

Now, the path to the door at 6 steps right and 3 step up is clear, except for other walls. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up (now gone), another at 3 steps right and 2 step up, 1 step up, etc. But I can navigate around them by moving up or down as needed.

Alternatively, after removing the blocking wall, move right towards the door. But the door is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. From the position after moving the ""wall is stop"" rule, which is now at 1 step left and 3 step up, moving right five times would get to 6 steps right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, that wall was already removed, right? Because we moved the ""wall is stop"" rule. So the wall instances are created based on the current rules. If the ""wall is stop"" rule is moved, any existing walls might disappear, or new ones appear where the rule is placed.

This is getting a bit complex. Maybe another approach: instead of moving the ""wall is stop"" rule, create a new rule that makes the door a you or win. For example, ""door is you"" or ""baba is door"".

To create ""door is you"", I need to have the ""door"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""you"" text block in positions where I can form the rule. The ""door"" rule is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. The ""you"" rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, no. Looking at the objects:

rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up

So they are all in a row to the right. So if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ""door"" rule and the ""you"" rule next to that, I can create ""door is you"".

But how to get those text blocks into position. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule left to be next to the ""door"" rule, then move the ""you"" rule left to be next to the ""is"" rule, then the three text blocks would form ""door is you"", making the door a you, so I can move into it and win.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""door"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 step up.
2. Move the ""is"" rule from 7 steps right to 6 steps right (next to door).
3. Move the ""you"" rule from 8 steps right to 7 steps right (next to is).
4. Now the rule ""door is you"" is created, so touching the door makes me win.

This seems promising. Let's see how to do this in actions.

Current position: Assuming I'm at the ""you"" rule, which is at 2 steps down. To reach the ""door"" rule at 6 steps right and 3 step up, I need to move right six times and up three times. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, which blocks the path. Unless I can move that wall's rule, which we discussed earlier.

So maybe first remove the blocking wall by moving its rule, then proceed to create the new rule.

Alternatively, create the new rule ""door is you"" by rearranging the existing ""door"", ""is"", ""win"" rules. Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. If I can rearrange ""door"", ""is"", and ""you"" (which is at 2 steps down, but the ""you"" rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up? No, looking back:

Objects on the map include:
rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 steps down
rule `you` 3 steps down
...

Wait, the ""you"" rule is at 3 steps down, not aligned with the ""door"", ""is"", ""win"" rules which are all at 3 step up. So the ""you"" rule is separate. To create ""door is you"", I need the ""you"" rule somewhere next to the ""door is"" part.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move towards the key to see if it's possible, but the key is blocked by a wall at 3 steps right. Alternatively, move the key's rule to get the key.

The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. The rule `key` is at 1 step up. So the ""key is ..."" rule is separate. If I can pick up the key by moving the ""key"" text block next to it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe becoming the key.

But to become the key, I need to create a rule ""baba is key"". To do that, I need the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" text blocks together.

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 step left and","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to get past this level in Baba Is You. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the door, which is considered a win. But sometimes the rules change, so I need to check the current setup.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. I think the key might be needed to unlock the door, but I'm not sure. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up, right? But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are stop, so I can't move through them. 

Baba is you, so if I can move Baba to the door, that should work. But the path is blocked. There's a key down at 4 steps right and 3 down. If I can get that key, maybe there's a rule that allows me to move through walls or something. Let me check the existing rules. The rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. No rules about the key yet. 

Hmm, maybe I need to create a new rule. Like, make the key a stop so I can push it, or maybe make myself able to move through walls. Wait, how do you create new rules? You have to move text blocks. For example, if there's a ""rule `key` ..."" somewhere, I could rearrange it. Let me look at the objects again.

There's a rule `key` at 1 step up. Maybe that's a text block that says ""key is something"". If I can move that text block and combine it with ""is"" and another property, I could change what the key does. For instance, if I make ""key is push"" or ""key is stop"", but I need to see where the ""is"" blocks are.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, and another at 7 steps right and 3 step up. The key's rule is at 1 step up. Maybe I can move the ""key"" text block next to an ""is"" and then another property to form a new rule. But where are the other properties? Like, if I can make ""key is you"" or ""key is win"", that might help.

Wait, the door is win, so if I can make the key win, then getting the key would make me win. But how? The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can reach it, maybe pick it up and then use it. But how do you pick up objects in Baba Is You? I think you have to be on the same space as the object and have a rule that allows it, like ""key is you"" or something.

Alternatively, maybe I need to break the wall rules. If there's a way to make walls not stop, then I could go through them. But the active rule is ""wall is stop"", so unless I change that, I can't. To change it, I need to move the ""wall"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""stop"" text block to rearrange them. For example, if I make ""stop is wall"", then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But where are those text blocks located?

The ""wall"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up, ""is"" is at 1 left and 3 up, and ""stop"" is at 3 step up. If I can move these three together to form ""stop is wall"", that would invert the rule. But I need to be able to move those text blocks. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move, but I have to avoid the walls. The path might be through the lower part.

Looking at the current position of Baba, the observation doesn't explicitly say where Baba is located. Wait, the objects listed don't include Baba's position. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's harder to plan. Maybe I need to assume a starting position or look for clues. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is the priority. If I can get the key, perhaps I can use it to unlock the door. But how? There's a door at 6 right and 3 up, which is win. If I can push the door or something. Wait, doors are usually win when you touch them. So if I can reach the door, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Looking at the map structure: there's a vertical line of walls on the right side starting from 3 steps right at various heights. The key is at 4 right and 3 down. Maybe I need to go down to get the key, then come back up. But how do I move around the walls? The walls are stop, so I can't walk through them. I have to go around them. 

The lower part has a door at 4 right and 1 down. Maybe that's a different door? Or is it part of the same door rule? Not sure. The key is at 4 right and 3 down, which is below the main structure. If I move down to get the key, then perhaps I can find a way to the door. But I need to navigate around the walls. 

Wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 left and 3 steps down. So that's Baba's position? The rule `baba` is a text block that says ""BABA IS YOU"". So Baba is located at that position. So if I can move that text block, I can change the rules. But moving text blocks requires being adjacent to them and moving them, which might be possible if the path is clear. 

From Baba's position at 2 left and 3 down, looking at the map, to the right there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 down. So I can't go straight right. But maybe down? If I move down from there, I can go to 2 left and 4 down. But is there a path? Let me visualize the map:

- Upper part has walls on the right, doors, etc.
- Lower part has a wall at 3 steps right and 3 down, and Baba's rule at 2 left and 3 down.
- The key is at 4 right and 3 down, which is to the right of the wall at 3 right and 3 down. So to get to the key, I need to go around the wall. But since walls are stop, I can't pass through. So maybe I need to move the wall rule to somewhere else to bypass it.

Alternatively, create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, ""stop is you"", which would make walls movable. But to do that, I need to rearrange the existing text blocks. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" text block next to ""is"" and ""you"", that could work. 

But how to do that? Let's see. The current rules are:

- wall is stop (rule `wall` at 2 left 3 up, rule `is` at 1 left 3 up, rule `stop` at 3 up)
- door is win (rule `door` at 6 right 3 up, rule `is` at 7 right 3 up, rule `win` at 8 right 3 up)
- baba is you (rule `baba` at 2 left 3 down, rule `is` at 1 left 3 down, rule `you` at 3 down)

So the ""stop"" rule is separate. To change ""stop"" to something else, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. For example, if I can make ""stop is you"", then walls would be you, meaning I can move through them. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" block next to ""is"" and ""you"".

Baba is at 2 left 3 down. The ""you"" rule is at 3 down, one step to the right. So from Baba's position, I can move right to 1 left 3 down (which is the ""is"" rule), then right to 3 down (the ""you"" rule). Then, if I can get the ""stop"" rule from 3 up to somewhere near ""is"" and ""you"", maybe I can form ""stop is you"".

But moving the ""stop"" rule from 3 up to 3 down would require pathing around the walls. The upper part has walls from 3 steps right up to 8 steps right. So moving down from 3 up to 3 down is possible if there's a clear path. Looking at the objects, between 3 up and 3 down, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 up, then 3 steps right and 1 up, etc. So maybe it's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe I can move horizontally. From the ""stop"" rule at 3 up, which is probably at the same horizontal level as the other upper rules. To get to the ""is"" and ""you"" rules at 3 down, I need to move down, but there might be walls in the way. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to first retrieve the key. The key is at 4 right and 3 down. To get there, I need to move from Baba's position at 2 left 3 down. Moving right twice would get to 0 left 3 down, but there's a wall at 3 right 3 down. So I can't go right past that. Maybe move down first to 2 left 4 down, then right? But I don't know if there's a path there.

Alternatively, use the existing rules to manipulate objects. For example, if I can make the key a pushable object, then maybe I can push it out of the way. But there's no ""push"" rule currently. 

Wait, the key is at 4 right 3 down. The door is at 6 right 3 up. The path between them is blocked by walls on the right. Maybe if I can move the wall rules to create a new path. 

Another thought: since the door is win, if I can make Baba into the door, then touching it would make me win. But how? To do that, I need to create a rule ""baba is door"" or ""door is you"". But the ""door"" rule is fixed as ""door is win"" unless I can move those text blocks.

The ""door"" rule is at 6 right 3 up, with ""is"" at 7 right 3 up and ""win"" at 8 right 3 up. So to change the door's property, I'd need to move those blocks. For example, making ""door is you"" would let me touch the door and win. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks.

This requires navigating to those text blocks, which are up high. From Baba's current position, it's probably a long journey up, but the path is blocked by walls. Unless there's a way around.

Alternatively, create a rule that allows moving through walls by redefining ""stop"". If I can make ""stop is you"", then walls become you, and I can walk through them. Let's see how to do that.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. The ""is"" rule is at 1 left 3 up, and ""you"" is at 3 down. So I need to move the ""stop"" block down to be near ""is"" and ""you"". But moving it would require pathing around the walls.

From the ""stop"" rule at 3 up, I can move down step by step if possible. Let's say I move down from 3 up to 2 up, then 1 up, then to the right or left. But there are walls at 3 steps right and various up positions. It might be possible to navigate down to the area of the ""you"" rule.

Once the ""stop"" rule is next to ""is"" and ""you"", I can form ""stop is you"", making walls passable. Then I can go through the walls to reach the door or the key.

This seems like a possible path. So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule from 3 up to near the ""is"" and ""you"" rules at 3 down.
2. Rearrange them to form ""stop is you"".
3. Then move through the walls to reach the key or door.

But how to physically move the ""stop"" rule? Since I'm Baba, I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" text block and move in a direction. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. Assuming Baba is at 2 left 3 down, moving up would get to 2 left 2 up, but there's a wall at 3 right 2 up. So maybe not.

Alternatively, find a way to reach the ""stop"" rule by moving horizontally. But the upper part has walls on the right, so it's blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe another approach: use the key to unlock something. If I can pick up the key, maybe there's a rule that allows using it to delete other rules. For example, in some levels, pressing a key deletes a rule. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

The key is at 4 right 3 down. To get there, I need to move from Baba's position (assuming it's at 2 left 3 down) right twice, but there's a wall at 3 right 3 down. So I can't go straight right. Maybe move down first to 2 left 4 down, then right to 1 left 4 down, then right to 0 left 4 down, etc., but I don't know if there's a clear path.

Alternatively, move the ""key"" rule to a different position. The ""key"" rule is at 1 step up. If I can move that to near ""is"" and another property, I could create a new rule. For example, ""key is win"" would make the key a win condition. But how to reach that ""key"" rule?

The ""key"" rule is at 1 step up, which is probably above the main structure. To get there, I might need to move up from Baba's position. But there are walls blocking the way. 

This level is really challenging. Maybe I need to focus on redefining the ""stop"" rule first. Let's try to outline the steps again:

- Current rules: wall is stop, door is win, baba is you.
- Goal: reach the door (6 right 3 up) or make yourself the door.
- Obstacles: walls blocking the path, need to manipulate rules.

Possible solution:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule to be near ""is"" and ""you"" to make ""stop is you"".
2. Now walls are you, so can walk through them.
3. Go through the walls to the door.

To do this, need to physically move the ""stop"" text block. Assuming Baba is at 2 left 3 down, how to reach the ""stop"" rule at 3 up.

The path from 2 left 3 down to 3 up would require moving up three steps, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 3 up, there's a wall at 3 right 3 up. So perhaps moving up isn't possible directly.

Alternative route: move horizontally to the right, then up. From 2 left 3 down, move right to 1 left 3 down (which is the ""is"" rule), then right to 3 down (the ""you"" rule). From there, move up to 3 down 1 up, but there's a wall at 3 right 1 up. Still blocked.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to grab the key and use it to delete a rule. For example, in some levels, touching a key deletes a nearby rule. If the key is at 4 right 3 down, and there's a rule nearby that says ""wall is stop"", touching the key might delete that rule, allowing passage.

But how to reach the key? Need to navigate around the walls. From Baba's position at 2 left 3 down, move down to 2 left 4 down, then right to 1 left 4 down, 0 left 4 down, and so on until reaching 4 right 3 down. But there might be walls blocking this path.

Alternatively, use the ""baba is you"" rule to push objects. If I can push a wall or a rule block, maybe rearrange them. But walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless there's a ""push"" rule.

Since there's no ""push"" rule, probably can't push. 

Another idea: create a rule that makes ""baba"" a ""win"". For example, ""baba is win"". Then touching any Baba would make you win. To do this, need to move the ""baba"" text block, ""is"", and ""win"" together.

The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left 3 down, ""is"" is at 1 left 3 down, and ""win"" is at 8 right 3 up. So it's a long way. Maybe move horizontally first to get the ""win"" rule closer.

But the ""win"" rule is far to the right. This might not be feasible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try moving in a direction that could lead to manipulating a rule. For example, moving right towards the key's area, even if blocked, to see if I can interact with text blocks there.

Alternatively, since the previous actions resulted in defaulting to idle due to invalid actions, perhaps the correct approach is to move down towards the key's location, hoping to find a way to pick it up or use it.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to move in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. My goal is probably to reach the door, which is win, but I might need to pick up the key first.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Right now, I'm not sure where I am exactly. Let me try to visualize the layout. From the observations, there are walls positioned in various places, and the rules are spread out. The key is down towards the bottom right. 

The rule `key` is at 2 steps up from the position of wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, maybe I need to check the positions more carefully. The key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So if I'm standing near the rule `baba` which is 2 steps to the left and 1 step down from the wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, that might be my current position. 

The door is at 4 steps to the right, so if I can get past the walls, I can reach it. But the key is in the way. Let me see the path. To get to the key at 4 right, 2 down, I need to move down from my current position. The wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down is there, but maybe I can move around it. Alternatively, the key is at 4 right and 2 down, which might be next to a wall. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So if I'm at the rule `baba` position (2 left, 1 down from 3 right, 1 down), moving down would take me to 1 step down from there, which is 3 steps right and 2 steps down, but there's a wall there. So I can't move straight down. Maybe I need to move right first. 

If I move right from my current position (assuming I'm at 3 right, 1 down), moving right would take me to 4 right, 1 down. Then I can check if that's blocked. The door is at 4 right, so maybe that's where the door is. But the key is at 4 right and 2 down. So after getting the key, I can move up to the door. 

But how do I get the key? The key is at 4 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move down twice from my current position. But there's a wall at 3 right and 2 down. So maybe I can move around that. If I move right to 4 right, 1 down, then down again to 4 right, 2 down, which is where the key is. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 down, but that's two steps to the left from the key's position. So maybe the path is clear? 

Wait, the wall is at 3 right and 2 down. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. So between them, there's one step to the right. So if I'm at 4 right, 1 down, moving down to 4 right, 2 down would place me next to the key. But is that step allowed? The wall is at 3 right, 2 down, so it's to the left of the key. So moving down from 4 right, 1 down to 4 right, 2 down should be possible if there's no wall there. Looking at the objects, the key is at 4 right, 2 down, and the only wall nearby is at 3 right, 2 down. So the step from 4 right,1 down to 4 right,2 down is free. 

So the plan is: move right once to get to 4 right, 1 down, then move down to 4 right, 2 down to pick up the key. Once I have the key, maybe the door's win condition changes, or I can use the key to open something. But in the current rules, door is still win. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the key rule to another position. Wait, the key rule is at 1 step up. So if I can move that rule somewhere else, perhaps I can change its property. But the key itself is an object; the rule `key` is a text block. To move the rule, I have to move the text blocks that form the rule. For example, the rule `key` is made of the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and whatever property. But in the current observation, the rule `key` is at 2 step up. Wait, looking back:

In the latest observation, the objects include ""rule `key` 2 step up"" and ""key 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down"". So the key object is separate from the rule that defines its property. The default rule is ""key is [something]"", but in the current active rules, I don't see a rule defining the key's property. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So the key's behavior isn't defined, which might mean it's passable. 

So to get the key, I just need to move to its position. Since the door is win, and it's at 4 steps to the right, perhaps after getting the key, there's a new rule that requires the key to reach the door. But in the current state, door is win, so touching it would win the level. 

But the key is at 4 right, 2 down. So moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at 3 right, 1 down) would require moving past the wall at 3 right, 2 down. Wait, no—my current position is rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 1 step down from the wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So that would place me at 3 right - 2 left = 1 step right, and 1 step down. So my position is 1 step right, 1 step down. 

Then, moving right would take me to 2 right, 1 down. Then right again to 3 right, 1 down (wall), so I can't go there. Alternatively, move down from 1 right, 1 down to 1 right, 2 down. But is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, wall is at 3 right, 2 down. So 1 right, 2 down is clear. Then from there, move right to 2 right, 2 down, then 3 right, 2 down (wall), then 4 right, 2 down (key). So that path is possible. 

But I need to check if the movement is allowed. The walls are defined as stop, so if I try to move into a wall, I can't. So steps to the key would be:

1. From current position (1 right, 1 down) move down to 1 right, 2 down (clear).
2. Move right to 2 right, 2 down.
3. Move right to 3 right, 2 down (wall, can't move).
4. Alternatively, move down again from 2 right, 2 down to 2 right, 3 down. But I don't know if there's a wall there. Looking at objects, the walls are at 3 right, 3 steps down, etc. So maybe that's clear. Then from 2 right, 3 down, move right to 3 right, 3 down (wall), then 4 right, 3 down (key's position is 4 right, 2 down). Hmm, this might not be the best path. 

Alternatively, after getting to 1 right, 2 down, move right to 2 right, 2 down, then up to 2 right, 1 down, then right to 3 right, 1 down (wall), which is blocked. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 4 right, 2 down, and the door is at 4 right, maybe I can move right to 4 right, 1 down (door's position), but the door is win, so if I can get there without the key, maybe that's the solution. But why is the key there then? Maybe the key is a red herring, or perhaps I need to pick it up to change a rule. 

Wait, another possibility: the rule `key` is at 2 step up. If I can move that rule to somewhere else, maybe I can make the key have a different property, like ""key is YOU"", so that I can pick it up. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and the property. However, the current active rules don't have a property for the key, so the rule is incomplete. The existing rule `key` 2 step up is just the subject and verb, but no property. So maybe it's a typo, or perhaps I need to complete it by moving the ""win"" or another property next to it. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 8 steps to the right and 3 step up. If I can move the ""key is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, making ""key is win"", then the key would become win, allowing me to step on it to win. Alternatively, moving ""key is you"" would make me the key. 

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule `key` is at 2 step up, which is probably near the other rules. Let's see the positions:

- rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 step up
- Then the walls on the upper right.

The rule `key` is at 2 step up, which might be in the upper middle area. If I can move the ""key is"" rule (which consists of the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and the property) to connect with another property, like ""win"" or ""you"", that could change the key's behavior. 

For example, if I move the ""is"" block from the ""key is"" rule to connect with the ""win"" rule, making ""key is win"", then the key would become win. Then stepping on the key would win the level. 

But how to move those text blocks? The player (Baba) is a ""you"" object, so I can move text blocks that are not stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. The other objects like the door, key, and rules (except stop) can be moved. 

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the position of the ""key is"" rule (2 step up).
2. Move the ""key"" and ""is"" blocks next to the ""win"" rule to form ""key is win"".
3. Then the key becomes win, and stepping on it would win the level.

Alternatively, moving ""key is you"" to make myself the key.

But let's check the current positions. The rule `key` is at 2 step up. The rule `win` is at 8 steps to the right and 3 step up. These are quite far apart. Maybe there's a more adjacent rule to connect. 

Alternatively, the rule `you` is at 2 steps down. If I can connect ""key is you"" there, that might make the key a you, allowing me to pick it up. 

But to do any of this, I need to navigate to the text blocks and rearrange them. 

Let me try to outline the steps:

- First, move to the area where the text blocks are. The ""key is"" rule is at 2 step up. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 step left and 1 step down from the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So my position is approximately 1 step right, 1 step down.

To reach the ""key is"" rule at 2 step up, I need to move up twice. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. Wait, looking at the objects:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `key` 2 step up

So the ""key is"" rule is at the same position as the wall 3 steps right and 2 step up? No, the wall is at 3 right, 2 up, and the rule `key` is at 2 step up, but where exactly? The description says ""rule `key` 2 step up"", which might mean 2 steps up from the player's current position or from another reference point. This is a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the previous observations, the text blocks are arranged in certain positions. 

Alternatively, the ""key is"" rule is located 2 steps up from the rule `wall` which is 2 steps left and 3 steps up. This is getting too vague. Maybe I should focus on moving towards the key object first and see if I can pick it up, then proceed to manipulate the rules. 

Alternatively, since the door is at 4 steps right, and it's the win condition, maybe I can just move right towards it. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so I can't go past that. Unless I can move the wall rule. 

The wall rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can change that rule to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, then the walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the text blocks of the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the text blocks: rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 step up, rule `is` 1 step left and 3 step up, and rule `stop` 3 step up. So these three are connected to form the rule. If I can move one of them, it would break the rule. 

For example, moving the ""stop"" block away from the ""is"" block would break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls not stop. Then I could move through them. 

But how to reach those text blocks? The player is at 1 step right, 1 step down. The ""wall is stop"" rule is up above. To get there, I need to move up, but there might be walls blocking the path. 

Looking at the current layout, the upper part has walls at 3 steps right and 3 step up, 2 step up, etc. It's possible that the path is blocked, making it hard to reach the text blocks to manipulate the rules. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is the way to proceed. If I can get the key, maybe the game allows carrying it and using it at the door. In some Baba Is You levels, keys can be used to unlock doors, which might involve changing the door's rule to require a key. 

So, to get the key at 4 right, 2 down, I need to navigate there. From my current position (assuming 1 right, 1 down), moving down to 1 right, 2 down (clear), then right to 2 right, 2 down, right to 3 right, 2 down (wall), so can't go there. Then down to 2 right, 3 down, right to 3 right, 3 down (wall), right to 4 right, 3 down. Then up to 4 right, 2 down (key). But this path seems possible if there are no walls in those steps. 

Alternatively, from 1 right, 1 down, move right to 2 right, 1 down (clear), then down to 2 right, 2 down, then right to 3 right, 2 down (wall), then down to 3 right, 3 down (wall), right to 4 right, 3 down, up to 4 right, 2 down (key). This also works. 

Once I have the key, I need to go to the door at 4 right. The door is at 4 right, so from the key's position (4 right, 2 down), moving up to 4 right, 1 down (door's position). The door is there, and since door is win, touching it should win the level. 

But wait, in the current observation, the door is at 4 steps to the right, and the key is also at 4 steps to the right but 2 steps down. So moving up from the key's position to 4 right, 1 down would reach the door. 

However, the path from the key to the door might be blocked. Let me check the objects between 4 right, 2 down and 4 right, 1 down. There's a door at 4 right, 1 down, and a wall at 3 right, 1 down. So the direct path is clear. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move from current position (1 right, 1 down) to the key at 4 right, 2 down.
2. Then move up to 4 right, 1 down (door) and win.

But how to move there without getting blocked? Let's break it down:

- Current position: Let's assume after previous moves, I'm at rule `baba` which is 2 step left and 1 step down from wall 3 right, 1 down. So that would be position (3 right - 2 left, 1 down) = (1 right, 1 down).

Moves to get to key (4 right, 2 down):

1. Down to 1 right, 2 down (clear).
2. Right to 2 right, 2 down.
3. Right to 3 right, 2 down (wall, can't move).
4. Down to 2 right, 3 down.
5. Right to 3 right, 3 down (wall).
6. Right to 4 right, 3 down.
7. Up to 4 right, 2 down (key).

Then from key at 4 right, 2 down:

1. Up to 4 right, 1 down (door).

But this requires navigating around walls, which might not be feasible. Alternatively, there might be a shorter path. 

Another approach: Since the key is at 4 right, 2 down, and the door is at 4 right, maybe I can move right past the walls. But the wall at 3 right blocks the direct path. Unless I can move the wall rule. 

To move the wall rule, I need to move the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". For example, if I can move the ""stop""","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are still ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"", and ""baba is you"". So, I'm Baba, and walls are stopping me. The goal is to reach the door, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. I need to get that key probably to unlock something or maybe to change a rule. But how? The key itself is just an object; unless there's a rule that says something about keys, but in the current active rules, there isn't. So maybe I need to move the key to a rule spot to create a new rule.

First, where am I currently located? The observation mentions ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down"". So, if the rule `baba` is at 2 left, 1 down from some reference point, then my position (Baba) is at that location. Let's assume the reference is the player's position. So, if I'm at 2 left and 1 down from where the rule `baba` is placed, that might mean my current position is adjusted accordingly. 

Wait, maybe the map is laid out with Baba's position somewhere, and the rules and objects are relative to that. The exact positions might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the objects again.

The key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down from wherever the reference point is. If I can move to that key's location, maybe I can pick it up or use it to create a new rule. But how do I move there? The walls are stopping me, so I need to navigate around them.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps to the right in various directions. For example, wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, wall 3 steps right and 2 steps up, etc. So, the path to the key at 4 steps right and 2 steps down might be blocked by these walls. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at position (0,0), the key is at (4, -2). The walls are at various positions around there. To get to the key, I need to move right past the walls. Let's see: from Baba's position (which is 2 left and 1 down from the rule `baba`?), maybe that's (2,1) if the rule is at (0,0). But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on actionable steps.

The key is at 4 right, 2 down. Current position of Baba is relative. Let's see: the rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 1 step down from somewhere. If that rule is part of the map's layout, perhaps Baba is at (2 left, 1 down) relative to that rule's position. But this is getting too abstract. Maybe it's better to look for possible moves.

Possible actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. Let's check which direction gets me closer to the key. If the key is 4 right and 2 down, then moving right four times and down two times. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 3 steps to the right in various positions. So, to get from current position to the key, I need to find a path that avoids walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key by pushing it, but the rules say that only non-stop objects can be moved. Since walls are stop, but the key might not be. Wait, the active rules don't specify that the key is stop, so maybe I can move it. But how? Do I need to be adjacent to it and move in the same direction?

Alternatively, maybe the key is a movable object, and I can pick it up and carry it to a rule spot to create a new rule. For example, placing ""key IS YOU"" or ""key IS WIN"" to change the game mechanics. But first, I need to get the key.

Looking at the current positions:

- The key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down.
- There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down.
- So, to reach the key at (4,2) down, I need to go past the wall at (3,2) down. But how? If I move right from my current position, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. Let me check my current position.

Assuming my position is where the rule `baba` is located, which is 2 step left and 1 step down. So if the rule `baba` is at, say, (0,0), then Baba is at (-2, -1). The key is at (4, -2). The walls are at various positions, including (3, -2) down, which is one step left of the key. So, to get to the key, I need to move right from (-2, -1) to (4, -2), but there's a wall at (3, -2). So, I can't go directly right around the wall.

Alternatively, maybe there's another path. Let's see the other walls:

- Wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up: that's (3,1) from the reference.
- Wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps up: (3,2) up.
- Wall at 3 steps right: (3,0).
- So, the path to the key is blocked at (3, -2). Maybe I can move down to avoid the wall? Let's see.

If I move down from my current position (-2, -1) to (-2, -2), is that possible? Are there walls there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, which would be (3, -2), not affecting my position. So moving down to (-2, -2) is free. Then, from there, maybe move right twice to (1, -2), then right again to (2, -2), but there's a wall at (3, -2), so I can't go further right. Then maybe move down to (2, -3), but I need to get to (4, -2). This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can move in a different direction. Let's see other possible moves. Up from (-2, -1) would be (-2, 0). Is there a wall there? Yes, wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up is (3,1), which is not in the same vertical line. So moving up to (-2,0) is possible. From there, move right to (-1,0), then (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), then down to (2, -1), but this seems like a detour.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't the immediate target. Perhaps I need to interact with the rules. The current rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. If I can change the ""door is win"" to something else, like ""key is win"", then getting the key would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""door is win"" rule and replace it with ""key is win"".

The ""door is win"" rule is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. The ""key"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So, to create ""key is win"", I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to the ""key"" rule. But how?

First, I need to locate the text blocks. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and another at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up. 

To create ""key is win"", I need to move the ""key"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block together. But text blocks that are part of active rules (like ""door is win"") might be considered immutable if they're part of a rule. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, you can move any text block that isn't part of a ""STOP"" or similar rule. So, the ""is"" and ""win"" in the ""door is win"" rule can be moved.

So, the plan could be:

1. Move to the location of the ""key"" rule (1 step right and 1 step down).
2. Bring an ""is"" rule next to it.
3. Bring a ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" to form ""key is win"".

Alternatively, since the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down, but the ""key"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down, maybe I need to move that ""key"" rule to the key's location.

Wait, the objects on the map include a ""rule `key` 1 step to the right and 1 step down"". So the ""key"" text block is separate from the actual key object. To create a new rule, I need to move the ""key"" text block, an ""is"", and a ""win"" next to each other.

So, the steps would be:

- Move to the ""key"" text block's location (1 step right, 1 step down).
- Then, move an ""is"" text block next to it, and then a ""win"" text block next to the ""is"".

But how to do that? Let's see the positions:

- ""rule `key`"" is at 1 step right and 1 step down.
- ""rule `is`"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down, and also at 7 steps right and 3 step up.
- ""rule `win`"" is at 8 steps right and 3 step up.

So, perhaps the closest ""is"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To get there from the ""key"" rule's location (1 right, 1 down), moving left two steps and down one step would reach the ""is"" rule. Then, move the ""win"" rule which is at 8 right, 3 up. That's quite far.

Alternatively, use another ""is"" rule at 7 right, 3 up. But that's also far.

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to first reach the ""key"" text block and then try to form the new rule.

Alternatively, maybe the key object itself is needed to interact with something. But since the key isn't part of any active rule, I'm not sure.

Another angle: since the door is the win condition, but I can't get past the walls to it. Maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to make walls passable. To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks that are not part of a ""STOP"" rule. So, if I can move the ""stop"" property from ""wall"" to something else, walls would no longer be stoppable.

To break ""wall is stop"", I need to move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of ""rule `wall` ..."" and ""rule `is` ..."" and ""rule `stop` ..."". So, if I can separate them, the rule is broken.

The ""wall is stop"" rule components are:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 step up

So, these three are connected to form the rule. To break it, I need to move one of these components away. For example, move the ""stop"" rule to a different position.

If I can move the ""stop"" text block that's 3 step up, maybe I can place it elsewhere. Let's see where that ""stop"" rule is. It's at 3 step up, which is in the same vertical line as the ""wall"" and ""is"" rules. To break the rule, I need to separate them.

Suppose I move the ""stop"" rule down. From its current position (3 step up), moving it down one step would place it at 2 step up. If I can do that, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because the components are no longer connected.

But can I move the ""stop"" rule? The active rules don't say that ""stop"" is stop, wait, ""wall is stop"", so the ""stop"" property is applied to walls. But the ""stop"" text block itself is a movable object unless it's part of a ""STOP"" rule. Wait, no. In Baba Is You, any text block that is not defined as ""STOP"" can be moved. Since ""stop"" here is a property applied to walls, the ""stop"" text block itself can be moved.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" text block that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule away, the rule breaks. Let's try that.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. If I move it down to 2 step up, that would break the connection between ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"". Then, walls would no longer be stoppable. That could let me pass through the walls.

So, the plan is:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule's location (3 step up).
2. Move it down one step.

But how to get there? The current position of Baba is at the rule `baba` which is 2 step left and 1 step down. Let's assume that position is (2 left, 1 down) relative to some origin. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up from that position. So, from Baba's position, moving up three steps would reach the ""stop"" rule.

But wait, the walls are in the way. For example, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So, if Baba is trying to move up from his position, he might hit that wall.

Let me visualize the relative positions again. If Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity, then:

- rule `baba` is at (0,0).
- The ""stop"" rule is at (0, 3).
- There's a wall at (3,3).
- So, moving up from (0,0) to (0,3) would require passing through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). But the wall at (3,3) is in a different x position, so that's not blocking Baba's path upwards. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and 3 step up, which would be (3,3) if the reference is (0,0). So, if Baba is at (0,0), moving up to (0,3) is possible as long as there's no wall in the way along that path. Since the wall at (3,3) is to the right, it doesn't block Baba's upward movement.

So, moving up three times from (0,0) would get to the ""stop"" rule at (0,3). Then, move the ""stop"" rule down to (0,2), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once that's done, walls are no longer stoppable, and I can pass through them.

After breaking that rule, I could then go around the walls to reach the door or the key. Alternatively, since the key is near the door area, maybe getting the key and then using it to change the win condition.

So, step-by-step:

1. Move up three times to reach the ""stop"" rule at (0,3).
2. Move the ""stop"" rule down to (0,2).
3. Now, walls are passable. Move around them to the key or door.
4. Pick up the key and use it to create a new rule, like ""key is win"", allowing me to win by reaching the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? To move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and push it in the desired direction. So, if I'm at (0,3) with the ""stop"" rule, I need to move in a direction that pushes it. For example, moving left would push the ""stop"" rule to the left, but I need to get it to (0,2). Since it's already at (0,3), moving down would require being below it, but I'm on top. So, to move the ""stop"" rule down, I need to be below it and move down, which would push it down.

Wait, in Baba Is You, to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in the direction you want to push it. So, if the ""stop"" rule is at (0,3), and I'm at (0,3), I need to move in a direction that pushes it. For example, moving down from (0,3) would push the ""stop"" rule to (0,2). Yes, that makes sense.

So, action sequence:

- Move up three times to reach (0,3) where the ""stop"" rule is.
- Then, move down once, which pushes the ""stop"" rule to (0,2), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stoppable. Then, I can move around them.

Next, head towards the key at (4, -2) or the door at (6,3). Let's say I go for the key. From (0,2), move right four times and down two times. But there's a wall at (3,2). Since walls are no longer stoppable, I can push through them? Wait, no. If the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken, then walls are just regular objects and can be moved or walked through. So, I can move past the wall at (3,2) by walking into it, since it's no longer a stop.

So, from (0,2), move right to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), then down to (4,1), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), which is the key's location.

Once I reach the key, I can pick it up (if possible) and then create a new rule. For example, move to the area where the ""key"" text block is (1 right, 1 down) and form ""key is win"".

But after breaking ""wall is stop"", the key is at (4,-2), and the ""key"" text block is at (1,1). To create ""key is win"", I need to bring the ""key"" text block, an ""is"", and","

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall. The goal is to get to the door, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. I might need that key to unlock the door, but I'm not sure yet. Let me check the positions again.

Baba's position seems to be at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down from the reference point (probably the starting point). The door is at 4 steps to the right, which is directly to the right of my current position. However, there's a wall 3 steps to the right, so I can't go straight right. There's also a door at 4 steps to the right, but maybe that's blocked by the wall.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So maybe I need to move down to get to the key first. Let's see the path. If I move right twice, I hit the wall. Hmm. Maybe I need to go down to get around the wall. Let me check the movement options.

If I move down from my current position (2 left, 1 down), moving down once would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The objects list shows walls at 3 steps right and various positions. Maybe moving down is possible if there's no wall blocking.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. Since the key is there, perhaps I need to pick it up to unlock something. But how do I get past the wall? The wall is a 'stop' property, so I can't move through it. Unless I change the rule that makes it a stop. For example, if I can make 'wall' something else, maybe it's no longer stop.

Looking at the rules, there's a 'wall is stop' rule at 2 left, 3 up. If I can move that text block somewhere else or break it, maybe I can remove the 'stop' property from walls. But to do that, I need to be able to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move objects unless they're stopped. Are the text blocks considered stop?

The 'wall is stop' rule says wall is stop, so any wall is a stop. But the text blocks themselves—are they movable? The tips mention that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar. So the rule blocks might be stop. Let me check the objects list. The rule `wall` is at 2 left, 3 up. Is that a stop? Yes, because the rule says wall is stop. So the rule blocks are probably stop, meaning I can't move them unless they're not stopped. Wait, but the rules are part of the game's structure. Maybe I can pick up the 'wall is stop' rule and move it away, which would remove the 'stop' property from walls.

So the plan would be: move the 'wall is stop' rule somewhere else to deactivate it, then go through the walls. But how? To move the rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's see where the 'wall is stop' rule is located. In the current observation, the rule `wall` is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up, and the rule `is` is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by those two text blocks. To break it, I need to move either the 'wall' or 'is' or 'stop' rule.

But the 'stop' rule is at 3 step up, same level as the wall and is. So if I can move the 'is' or 'wall' part of the 'wall is stop' rule, that would break the rule. For example, moving the 'is' block down or somewhere else.

Looking at my current position: I'm at rule `baba` which is 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So my position is relative to the other objects. Let me map this out mentally.

If I'm at 2 left, 1 down, and the 'is' part of the wall rule is at 1 left, 3 up, which is quite far. Moving there would require several steps up and left, but there might be walls in the way. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer rule that I can manipulate.

Another approach: The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to move right twice and down once. But the wall at 3 steps right blocks the direct path. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can go through it. So breaking the 'wall is stop' rule would allow moving through walls. That seems like the key.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the location of the 'wall is stop' rule.
2. Break that rule by moving either 'wall' or 'is' or 'stop' away.
3. Once the rule is broken, walls are no longer stops, allowing movement through them.
4. Then navigate to the key, pick it up (if needed), and go to the door.

Alternatively, maybe the door doesn't require a key. Let me check the active rules again. The door is win, so just reaching it would win the level. But the path is blocked by a wall. If I can remove the wall's stop property, then I can go through the wall and reach the door.

So focusing on breaking the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall' part of the rule is at 2 left, 3 up. The 'is' part is at 1 left, 3 up. To break the rule, I need to move at least one of these parts. Since I'm at 2 left, 1 down, moving up to reach the 'is' or 'wall' rule would be possible.

Let me calculate the moves needed. From my position (2 left, 1 down):

- To get to the 'is' rule at 1 left, 3 up: need to move left once and up twice.
- To get to the 'wall' rule at 2 left, 3 up: need to move up twice.

But moving up twice from my current position (1 down) would take me to 3 up. Let's see if there are any walls in the way. Between here and 3 up, are there any stop objects?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. But that's to the right, not in my path. My path is vertical. Assuming there are no walls blocking upward movement, I could move up twice to reach the 'wall' rule.

Once there, I can move the 'wall' text block. Since the rule is ""wall is stop"", moving the 'wall' part would break the rule. So moving the 'wall' text block down or left would deactivate the 'wall is stop' rule.

Alternatively, moving the 'is' part of the rule would also break it. But the 'is' is at 1 left, 3 up, which is diagonally up and left from my current position. To reach it, I need to move left once and up twice. But again, checking for obstacles.

Assuming I can move freely up, the optimal path would be to move up twice to reach the 'wall' rule at 2 left, 3 up, then move the 'wall' text block somewhere else. For example, moving it down to 2 left, 4 up. That would break the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable.

Once that's done, I can move right through the wall at 3 steps right and proceed to the door at 4 steps right.

Alternatively, if I can't move the text blocks because they are considered stop, maybe I need to find another way. Wait, the rules say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar. The 'wall is stop' rule makes walls stop, but what about the text blocks themselves? The 'rule `wall`' is a text block. Are they considered stop? The rule doesn't specify that the text blocks are stop, only that walls are stop. So maybe the text blocks can be moved as long as they're not marked as stop.

So I can move the 'rule `wall`' text block. If I move it, the 'wall is stop' rule is broken. That would make walls no longer stop. So the plan is:

1. Move up twice to reach the 'rule `wall`' text block at 2 left, 3 up.
2. Move that text block down or sideways to break the rule.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so I can walk through them.
4. Go right through the wall at 3 steps right to reach the door at 4 steps right.

But how do I move the 'rule `wall`' text block? From my position at 2 left, 1 down, moving up twice lands me at 2 left, 3 up, which is where the 'rule `wall`' is. Then I can move it in any direction, say down to 2 left, 4 up. That would break the 'wall is stop' rule.

Once that's done, moving right twice (past the wall at 3 steps right) would take me to the door at 4 steps right, which is the win condition.

So the actions needed are:

- Up, Up
- Down (or another direction to move the text block)

But the problem is choosing the correct sequence of actions in real-time based on the current observation. The latest observation shows that after some failed actions, the environment might have reset, but the active rules are still the same.

In the current observation, after previous failed actions, the agent is idle, and the observation shows the same active rules and objects. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. The door is at 4 right. The wall is at 3 right.

So the immediate action should be to move towards the 'rule `wall`' text block to break the rule. From the current position of Baba (rule `baba` at 2 left, 1 down), moving up twice would get to the 'rule `wall`' at 2 left, 3 up. Then move the text block down.

But in the action format, I can only output one action at a time. So the first step is to move up twice. However, in each step, I can only give one action. So first, move up once, then up again, then move the text block.

But in the current observation, after the previous defaults to idle, the agent is again at the same position. So the first action should be to move up to get closer to the 'rule `wall`' text block.

Looking at the latest observation, the key is at 4 right, 2 down. The agent's position is at rule `baba` 2 left, 1 down. So to reach the 'rule `wall`' text block at 2 left, 3 up, the agent needs to move up twice.

So the first valid action is 'up' to move up once. Then 'up' again. Then, once adjacent to the 'wall' rule, move it. But since we can only output one action per step, the immediate action should be 'up' to move closer.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are ""wall is stop,"" ""door is win,"" and ""baba is you."" So, I'm Baba, and walls stop me. The goal is to get to the door, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down. But right now, the key is probably behind walls or other blocks. Let me check the map layout again.

From the observation, I see the key is at 4 steps right and 3 down. But I'm currently positioned somewhere. Wait, the exact position of Baba isn't specified here. Let me infer. The key is at 4 right, 3 down. Are there walls blocking the path? There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, and another at 3 right and 1 step down. Maybe the key is accessible if I move down or right.

But the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. How do I reach there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's see. If I go right from my current position, maybe I can avoid the walls. Alternatively, moving down towards the key might be necessary to unlock the door, but the door is a win condition as it is, unless there's a rule change required.

Wait, the key is present, but there's no ""key is win"" rule. So maybe I need to get the key first? But if the door is already a win, why would I need the key? Unless the rule ""door is win"" has been changed. Wait, no, the active rules still show ""door is win,"" so stepping on the door should win the level.

But how to reach the door? Let's look at the path. From my position (assuming I'm at the default start, which is often the bottom-left or something), moving right towards the door. But there are walls at 3 steps right in various positions. For example, at 3 steps right and 1 step up is a wall. So moving up directly might hit a wall.

Looking at the objects again: rule `key` 1 step up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to move down to get to the key first. But the door is at 6 steps right and 1 step up. Perhaps I can move right past the walls.

Wait, the walls at 3 steps right are in various positions. Let me map this out mentally. Let's assume my position is at (0,0). Then:

- The wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up is at (3,3).
- The rule `door` is at (6,3).
- The key is at (4,3).
- The wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down is at (3,-1).

So to get to the door at (6,3), I need to move right from (0,0) to (6,3). But there's a wall at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and (3,-1). So the path is blocked on the right side at x=3. Maybe I need to go around the walls. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can make the walls not stop me, or change the win condition to something else. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks.

Looking at the rules on the map:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up: So the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is at (-2,3).
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up: Part of ""WALL IS STOP"".
- rule `stop` 3 step up: The ""STOP"" property is at (0,3).

If I can move the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule, I could change what walls do. But to move a rule, I have to be adjacent to both the text block and the object it's applied to, and I can't move objects that are STOP.

Assuming I'm Baba, I need to move the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule to somewhere else. Let's see where I am. If I'm at the position of ""baba"" rule, which is 2 steps to the left and 3 steps down from somewhere. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down in one of the observations. Maybe I'm at that position.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm at the position of the ""baba is you"" rule. This is getting a bit confusing without knowing my exact location. But given the previous actions, the assistant was trying to move up, down, left, right, sometimes failing.

In the last few observations, the assistant tried moving down, up, right, etc., but sometimes the action wasn't valid. Now, the current observation shows the key at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the key, then use it to unlock the door, but I don't see a lock on the door. Alternatively, maybe the key is a red herring.

Alternatively, since the door is already a win, maybe I can just path to it by moving around the walls. For example, move right, then up, avoiding the walls. Let's see:

From my current position (assuming I'm at the start), moving right three times would get to x=3, but there's a wall at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc. So moving right directly is blocked. Maybe move down first to get around the wall.

For example:

1. Move down to avoid the wall at (3,3).
2. Then move right past the wall at (3,2) by going around it down or up.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the key is needed to remove a wall. If I pick up the key and move it somewhere, perhaps it can change a rule. For instance, if there's a rule that says ""key is unlock,"" but that's not active here.

Alternatively, the key might be used to override a STOP rule. If I place the key next to a wall, maybe it becomes passable. But the active rules don't mention key properties.

Given the current active rules, the only way to win is to step on the door. So the priority is to reach the door at (6,3). To do that, need to navigate around the walls.

Looking at the wall positions:

- (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,-1) are walls.

So moving right from x=0 to x=3 is blocked. Maybe move down to x=3, y=-1, then right to x=4, then up?

Wait, the key is at (4,3). If I can get there, maybe that's useful. Let's try to outline a path:

Start at (0,0).

1. Move down to (0,-1).
2. Move right to (1,-1).
3. Move right to (2,-1).
4. Move right to (3,-1) — but that's a wall. Can't move there.
5. So instead, from (2,-1), move up to (2,0).
6. Move right to (3,0) — but (3,0) is a wall?
Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right (x=3) and various y positions. At y=0, is there a wall? The observation lists walls at 3 steps right and 1 step up, 2 step up, etc., but not at y=0. So maybe moving right to (3,0) is possible.

7. From (3,0), move up to (3,1) — but that's a wall.
8. Move up to (3,2) — also a wall.
9. Move up to (3,3) — wall again.

Alternatively, from (3,0), move right to (4,0), then up to (4,1), etc., towards the key at (4,3).

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since the door is at (6,3), maybe move directly right and up, avoiding walls by moving down where possible.

For example:

1. Move right to (1,0).
2. Move right to (2,0).
3. Move right to (3,0) — possible if no wall.
4. Move up to (3,1) — wall.
5. Move down to (3,-1) — wall.
6. Hmm, stuck.

Alternative path:

Start at (0,0).

1. Move up to (0,1).
2. Move right to (1,1).
3. Move right to (2,1).
4. Move right to (3,1) — wall.
5. Move down to (3,0).
6. Move right to (4,0).
7. Move up to (4,1).
8. Move up to (4,2).
9. Move up to (4,3) — key is here.
Pick up the key (but how? In Baba Is You, you push objects adjacent to you. So if I'm at (4,3), which has the key, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. But the key is an object, so to move it, I have to be next to it and move in a direction, pushing it if there's space.

Assuming I'm at (4,2) and move up to (4,3), which has the key. Then I can move the key to another spot, perhaps near a rule to modify it.

But the goal is to get to the door. Maybe after getting the key, there's a way to interact with it to remove a wall. But without a rule like ""key is unlock,"" it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the door's win condition can be changed. For example, if I can make ""door is stop"" or ""door is you,"" but that would prevent winning.

Alternatively, the key might be used to create a new rule. For example, placing the key next to a ""rule"" text block to create a new rule. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the previous actions, maybe the simplest path is to keep moving down towards the key and then right towards the door, avoiding walls. Alternatively, try to rearrange the rules to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

To do that, I need to move the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. The rule is at (-2,3) relative to somewhere. If I can get to that position and move the text blocks, I could change the rule. But that requires navigating to that area, which might be blocked.

Alternatively, if I can make myself ""stop,"" then I can push walls, but that's counterproductive.

Hmm. This is tricky. Given the previous valid actions were moving up, down, left, right, perhaps the best bet is to continue moving in a direction that gets closer to the door, avoiding walls.

In the current observation, the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I'm positioned somewhere above or to the left, moving down and right towards the key might help. Once I have the key, maybe I can use it to modify a rule near the door.

But without knowing the exact position, it's hard to say. Given the previous failures, maybe the correct action now is to move down towards the key, then right, then up to the door.

So, the next action could be ""down"" to approach the key's location.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need that key to open the door? But the door is at 4 steps to the right, same x-coordinate as the key. Wait, the key is 2 steps down from there. So maybe I need to go get the key first.

Currently, where am I? The rule 'baba' is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So my position is 2 left and 1 down from some reference point. Let me map this out. 

Let's consider the grid. The walls and rules are placed in specific steps. The key is at (4r, 2d), and the door is at (4r, 1u). So the key is below the door. To reach the key, I need to move down from my current position. But wait, my current position is 2 left and 1 down. So from there, moving right would get me closer to the key. Let me check the path.

If I move right once, I'm at 1 left and 1 down. Then maybe right again to 0 left and 1 down. Then right again to 1 right and 1 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, 1 step down, 2 steps down, 3 steps down, etc. So moving right from my current position (2 left, 1 down) towards the key (4r, 2d) might be blocked by some walls. Let me see:

From my position (2 left, 1 down), moving right step by step:

1. Right once: 1 left, 1 down. Is there a wall here? The walls at 3 steps right, but that's further. Maybe there's no wall here. So I can move right.

2. Right again: 0 left, 1 down. Still no wall mentioned here. So proceed.

3. Right again: 1 right, 1 down. Now, checking the walls. There's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So at 3r, 1d, there's a wall. But I'm at 1r, 1d here. So no wall yet.

4. Right again: 2 right, 1 down. Still clear.

5. Right again: 3 right, 1 down. Here's a wall. So I can't go past that. So to get to the key at 4r, 2d, I need to move right twice from my current position (to 2r, 1d), then down once to 2r, 2d, which is where the key is. Wait, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe my coordinates are different. Let me clarify.

Wait, the 'baba' rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I consider that as my position, then the reference point (maybe the top-left corner) has Baba at 2 left and 1 down. So to move right, I decrease the left steps and increase the right steps. For example, moving right once would put me at 1 left, 0 right, 1 down. Then right again to 0 left, 1 right, 1 down. Then right again to 1 right, 1 down. Then right again to 2 right, 1 down. Then down once to 2 right, 2 down. That's where the key is. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So moving from 2r,1d to 3r,1d is blocked. So I can't go further right than 2r,1d. But the key is at 4r,2d. So maybe I need to move down first to 2r,2d, then right? But 2r,2d is the key's position. Let me check if there's a wall there. The walls listed are at 3r,2d. So from 2r,2d, I can move right to 3r,2d, but there's a wall there. So that's blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. Since the key is at 4r,2d, perhaps I can pick up the key by moving to it. But if I can't get past the wall at 3r,1d, maybe I need to change a rule to bypass the wall. For example, if I can make 'wall' not a 'stop', then I can move through walls. But how?

The current rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So to make wall not stop, I need to change the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block and recombine them. For example, if I can move 'wall' to be 'stop' elsewhere, but the rules are formed by [Subject] IS [Property]. So maybe if I can move the 'wall' rule and 'stop' rule together to form a new rule. But the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, and the 'wall' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the 'wall' rule is 2 left, 3 up, and 'stop' is 4 up. So they are not adjacent. To create a new rule, I need to have the subject and property adjacent. So maybe I need to move the 'stop' rule down to be near the 'wall' rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like 'wall is not stop' by moving the 'wall' and 'stop' text blocks. But the game allows combining two adjacent text blocks into a new rule. For example, if 'wall' is next to 'stop', then you can create 'wall is stop'. But to negate it, you'd need to rearrange them. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe create a rule like 'stop is you', which would make stop not be a stop. But that's risky.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key first. If I can get the key, maybe the door becomes accessible without needing to go through walls. Wait, the door is at 4 steps right, same x as the key, but 1 step up. So if I have the key, maybe the door is no longer a wall or requires the key. But the current rule is door is win, so having the key might not be necessary. Unless there's a 'key is needed' rule that's not present here. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is a red herring, and the real solution is to push something. But I don't see other objects except walls, door, key, and rules.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So as Baba, I can move through anything except walls. So if I can reach the door, which is a win, that's the goal. But the door is at 4 steps right. From my current position (2 left,1 down), moving right four times would get me there, but there's a wall at 3 steps right,1 down. So I can't pass through that wall.

So the path is blocked. Therefore, I need to either move the wall, change the rule so walls aren't stops, or find another way around.

To move the wall, I need to be able to push it. But the rule is wall is stop, which means walls are immovable. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing, but there isn't. So that's not possible.

Changing the rule: to make 'wall' not a 'stop', I need to alter the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'wall' text block and 'stop' text block and recombine them into a different rule. For example, if I can make 'stop is wall' or 'wall is door', but that might not help. Alternatively, create a rule that 'stop is you', making stops passable.

But how to do that? Let's see the current text blocks. The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up, and the 'wall' rule is at 2 left,3 up. They're not adjacent. So I need to move them next to each other.

If I move downwards towards the 'stop' rule. Let's see:

My current position is rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, no, in the latest observation, the 'baba' rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So position is 2 left, 1 down.

The 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. So to reach it, I need to move up. But moving up from 1 down to 4 up would require moving up 5 steps. But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 3 step up, there's a wall. So moving up directly is blocked.

Alternatively, move right towards the 'stop' rule. From 2 left,1 down, moving right three times would get to 1 left,1 down, then 0 left,1 down, then 1 right,1 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right,1 down, which is beyond my current path. So moving right to 3 right,1 down is blocked. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, move down. From 1 down, moving down more. The 'stop' rule is at 4 up, so not helpful.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the key is necessary. To get the key at 4r,2d, I need to reach there. But the path is blocked by walls. Unless I can change the wall rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to move through walls. For example, 'you is stop' would make me a stop, which is bad. Or 'baba is stop', which would stop me. Not helpful.

Wait, the current rules are wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. If I can create a rule like 'stop is win', then stops would be win, but that might not help. Or 'you is win', which would make me win immediately. That could be a solution.

How to create 'you is win'? The existing 'you' rule is at 1 step down. So if I can move the 'you' and 'win' text blocks next to each other. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps to the right and 3 step up. That's far away. Not reachable without moving a lot.

Alternatively, the 'door is win' rule is present. If I can make 'baba is door', then since door is win, I would be win. So creating 'baba is door' would make me the door, which is win. That could work.

To create 'baba is door', I need to move the 'baba' rule and 'door' rule next to each other. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left,1 down. The 'door' rule is at 6 steps right,3 step up. That's quite far. So moving there would require avoiding walls and navigating the grid.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key first. Let's try to plan a path to the key.

From current position: 2 left,1 down.

Goal: key at 4r,2d.

Possible path:

1. Move down to 2 left,2 down. Is there a wall? The walls at 3r,2d. So if I move down, my position becomes 2 left,2 down. Then move right step by step:

- Right to 1 left,2 down: no wall.
- Right to 0 left,2 down: no wall.
- Right to 1r,2 down: no wall.
- Right to 2r,2 down: key is here. So that's the key's position.

Wait, the key is at 4r,2d. Wait, no, in the current observation, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So from my current position (2 left,1 down), moving right twice and down once gets me to 2r,2d, which is the key's position? Let me check:

Current position: 2 left,1 down.

Move down once: 2 left,2 down.

Move right twice: 0 left,2 down, then 1r,2 down. Still not at 4r,2d. Oh, right. The key is at 4r,2d. So from 1r,2 down, need to move right three more times. But there's a wall at 3r,2d. So can't go past that.

So even if I get to the key's x-coordinate (4r), the wall blocks the path. Unless I move the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall. But the rule says wall is stop, so I can't push it.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make 'you' the win condition. For example, create 'you is win' by moving the 'you' and 'win' text blocks next to each other.

The 'you' rule is at 1 step down. The 'win' rule is at 8r,3u. That's a long way. Alternatively, the 'door is win' rule is present. If I can make 'baba is door', then since door is win, I would be win.

To create 'baba is door', I need to move the 'baba' rule (2 left,1 down) and the 'door' rule (6r,3u) next to each other. That's a significant distance. Let's see if there's a path.

From current position (2 left,1 down), moving up to reach the 'door' rule's area. But there are walls at 3r,1d, 3r,2d, etc. Maybe move up and right cautiously.

Alternatively, focus on changing the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I need to move the 'wall' rule and 'stop' rule next to each other and rearrange them into a different rule. For example, 'stop is wall' or 'wall is key' (though that doesn't help).

The 'wall' rule is at 2 left,3 up. The 'stop' rule is at 4 up. So moving the 'wall' rule down to be next to the 'stop' rule.

From 2 left,3 up, moving down to 2 left,4 up (same as 'stop' rule's y-coordinate). Then, they are adjacent vertically. So combining 'wall' and 'stop' vertically would create a new rule. But how does the game handle combining? If they are adjacent horizontally or vertically, you can create a new rule by combining them.

So if I move the 'wall' rule down one step to be at 2 left,4 up, next to the 'stop' rule at 4 up. Then, combining them would create a new rule. For example, 'wall is stop' is already there. If I rearrange them to 'stop is wall', that would change the rule. Then 'stop' would be wall, which might not be a stop anymore. But since walls are defined as stop, this could be tricky.

Alternatively, create a rule like 'wall is door', which would make walls act as doors, which are win. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe the best immediate action is to try to move towards the key despite the walls, but given the obstacles, that might not be possible. Alternatively, move towards the 'stop' rule to change the wall rule.

But given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to reach the key's position, but considering the walls, maybe move right instead.

Wait, in the latest observation, the key is at 4r,2d. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 left,1 down. So to get to 4r,2d, I need to move right 4 times and down 1 time. But there's a wall at 3r,1d. So moving right past 3r would be blocked.

Alternatively, move down to 2 left,2d, then right to 4r,2d. But from 2 left,2d, moving right four times would require passing through 3r,2d which is a wall. So no.

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that allows movement through walls. For example, 'stop is you', making stops passable. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' and 'you' rules next to each other.

The 'you' rule is at 1 step down. The 'stop' rule is at 4 up. So moving down to 'you' rule's position.

From 2 left,1 down, moving down to 2 left,2 down, then 2 left,3 down. But there's a wall at 3r,3d. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move right towards the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 1 step down, which is in the same row as my current position (1 down). So from 2 left,1 down, moving left once would be 3 left,1 down. Not helpful.

This is quite challenging. Maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's see the objects again:

- rule `baba` at 2 left,3 down.
- rule `is` at 1 left,3 down.
- rule `you` at 3 down.
- walls at various positions.

Wait, the 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. So if I can get there and combine it with another rule, maybe I can change the 'you' property.

Alternatively, the key is at 4r,2d. Maybe I need to go there and use it. But how?

Wait, the door is at 4r,1u. So if I have the key, maybe the door requires it. But the current rule is door is win, so maybe the key is irrelevant. Unless there's a 'key is needed' rule that's not present.

Alternatively, maybe pushing a wall. But walls are stop, so I can't.

Given all this, perhaps the best action now is to move right towards the key, even though there's a wall blocking","

Let's try to figure out the best action here. The active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get to the door, which is a win condition. But I need to navigate around the walls and possibly use the key. Right now, I can see a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe picking that up will help.

Looking at the objects, Baba is me because of the ""baba is you"" rule. So, I can move around unless there's a wall. The walls are stop, meaning I can't move into them. Let me check my position. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. If I'm currently at the position where ""rule 'baba' 2 step to the left and 1 step down"" is, that might be my starting point. Wait, the rule 'baba' is located 2 steps left and 1 step down from somewhere. Maybe I need to figure out my exact location based on the map.

Alternatively, maybe I can move towards the key first. The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. If I'm standing at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 2 steps left and 1 step down from another point, perhaps moving down once would get me closer. Let me check the objects again.

The door is at 4 steps to the right, same level as the current position maybe. But there's a wall blocking the path. The wall is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So, if I move right towards the door, there's a wall there. Maybe I need the key to unlock it? But how does the key work here? In Baba Is You, keys sometimes can be used to push blocks or open doors, but the current rules don't specify that. Since the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you, I might need to change a rule to make the key usable.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule `key` 1 step to the right. Wait, no, in the current observation, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The rule `key` is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down in some previous observations. Maybe I need to grab the key and then move it to create a new rule. For example, if I take the key and place it next to a door, maybe ""key is win"" or something, but I need to be able to move the text blocks.

But right now, the only movable objects are probably the ones not defined as stop. Since wall is stop, I can't move them. The rules like ""wall is stop"" are text blocks that can be moved if they aren't stopped. Wait, the tip says you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So, if a text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, you can't move it. But in this case, the active rule is ""wall is stop"", so any wall is stop. The text blocks for the rules (like ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left..."")—are those considered stop? I think the rules themselves are objects, and if they're not part of a stop rule, they can be moved.

So, the key is at 4 right and 2 down. To get there, I need to move down from my current position. Let me see where I am. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left and 1 down. If I'm standing on the tile where the 'baba' rule is, then moving down would take me to 1 step down, which is a wall (3 steps to the right and 1 step down is a wall). So I can't move down directly there. Maybe I need to move right first to avoid the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I should move up to reach the key. The key is 2 steps up from the current position. Looking at the map, the key is at 2 step up. If I move up twice, I can get to the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 2 step up. So if I move up, I have to be careful not to hit the wall.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. If I'm currently at the position of the 'baba' rule (2 left, 1 down), then moving right twice and down once would get me to the key. Let's break it down: from 'baba' at 2 left, 1 down, moving right twice would get me to the same x as the door (4 steps right?), then down once to 2 steps down. But the key is at 4 right and 2 down. So maybe that's the path. But I need to check if there are walls in between.

Looking at the objects, between me and the key: moving right from my position (assuming I'm at 2 left, 1 down) to 4 right would require passing through steps. Let's see the map layout. The walls are at 3 steps right and various positions. So moving right from 2 left to 4 right would pass through 3 right, which has walls at different up/down positions. But if I move right twice (to 3 right and then to 4 right), I need to make sure there's no wall blocking. The wall at 3 steps right is at 4 step up, 3 step up, etc., but at 1 step up, there's a wall. Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up is a stop. So if I move right to 3 steps right, I can't go past that because it's a wall. Therefore, moving right directly to 4 steps right might be blocked by the wall at 3 steps right.

Hmm, this is complicated. Maybe I need to move down first to avoid the wall. If I move down from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to 2 left and 2 down. Is there a wall there? The objects show a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. But I'm at 2 left, so moving down would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at various positions, but I don't see a wall at 2 left, 2 down. So maybe I can move down safely. Then from there, move right towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a way to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""key is win"" or ""baba is win"", then grabbing the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule and combine it with ""key"" or ""baba"". The current ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 step up. To move that, I need to be able to move the text block. Since ""wall is stop"" is the only stop rule, unless there's another stop property, the text blocks might be movable.

So, perhaps I can move the ""key"" rule and combine it with ""is win"" or something. Let's see. The ""key"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 3 steps down in some observations, but in the current one, the key is at 4 right and 2 down, and the rule `key` is at 1 step to the right. Wait, in the current observation, the objects list includes ""rule `key` 1 step to the right"". So the text block ""key"" is located 1 step to the right from somewhere. Maybe I need to move that text block next to the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win"".

But to do that, I need to navigate to where the ""key"" text block is. It's at 1 step to the right. If I'm at my current position (2 left, 1 down), moving right three times would get me to 1 step right (since 2 left to 0 left is center, then +1 right is 1 right). But there's a wall at 3 steps right, but I'm only moving to 1 step right. Is there a wall at 1 step right? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but not at 1 step right. So moving right to 1 step right might be possible. Then, pick up the ""key"" text block and move it next to the ""win"" rule.

But first, I need to get to the ""key"" text block. It's at 1 step to the right. If I move right once from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to 1 step right, that's possible. Then, I can move the ""key"" text block to somewhere else. For example, place it next to the ""is"" rule to make ""key is win"". The ""is"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up for the door, but there's also an ""is"" rule at 1 step left and 2 steps down near me. Wait, in the current objects, there's a rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can move the ""key"" text block next to that ""is"" and the ""win"" rule, I can create ""key is win"".

But this requires multiple steps: move to the ""key"" text block, move it, then move to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. If I can get the ""key"" and then stand on it, but I don't think keys do anything by default unless there's a rule for them.

Alternatively, maybe the door is behind a wall, and the key is needed to move the wall. But since the only rule is ""wall is stop"", and the key's rule is just ""rule `key` 1 step right"", unless I change that rule to make the key affect the wall, it won't help. So perhaps the intended solution is to move the ""key is"" rule to create a new rule.

But this is getting complicated. Let's think again. The immediate goal is to reach the door, which is a win condition. The door is at 4 steps right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So unless I can move that wall, I can't get past it. To move the wall, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, make ""wall is not stop"" or something. But that would require moving the ""stop"" rule or changing the ""wall"" rule.

Alternatively, make ""baba is push"", so I can push the wall. But again, that requires creating a new rule. Let's see the available text blocks. There's a ""rule `wall` 2 step left and 4 up"", ""rule `is`""s, ""rule `stop`"" at 4 up, etc. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But moving the ""stop"" rule requires that it's not stopped itself. Since ""wall is stop"", but the ""stop"" rule is a separate text block. If the ""stop"" rule is not part of a stop rule, then it can be moved.

In the current observation, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 4 step up. So if I can move that text block, I can remove the ""stop"" property from walls. Then walls wouldn't block movement. That might be a way to proceed. So the plan would be: move the ""stop"" rule to another location, thus removing the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing movement through walls. Then go around the wall to the door.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is a text block located at 4 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's assume my current position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 2 left and 1 down. The ""stop"" rule is 4 step up. So from my position, moving up four steps would get me there, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 3 steps right and 2 step up is a wall. So maybe that's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""baba can move through walls"" by rearranging existing rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba is push"". But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule or find another way.

This is getting quite involved. Maybe there's a simpler solution. Let's check the key again. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. If I can get to the key, maybe there's a way to use it. But without a rule that states what the key does, it's probably just an object. Unless combining it with another rule.

Wait, in some Baba Is You levels, keys can be used to push blocks or open doors, but that requires specific rules. Since the current rules don't mention keys, maybe the solution is different. Let's look at the rules again: wall is stop, door is win, baba is you. So the only way to win is to reach the door, which is behind a wall. To get past the wall, either remove the ""stop"" property from walls or find a way to move the wall.

Another approach: maybe the wall is a text block that can be moved. Since ""wall is stop"" is a rule, but the wall object itself is a separate entity. If I can move the wall, perhaps by making it not a wall. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""rock is stop"", making the existing walls not stop. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule and replace it.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 left and 4 up. If I can move that text block to say, next to ""rock"", then ""rock is stop"" would be created, and the original walls would no longer be stop. But I don't see a rock on the map. Alternatively, change ""wall is stop"" to ""floor is stop"", but that might not help.

Alternatively, make ""baba is push"", allowing me to push the wall. To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is push"". The existing rules are ""baba is you"", ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"". The text blocks for these rules are located at various positions. For example, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 2 left and 4 down. If I can move that ""baba"" rule to say, next to ""push"", then ""baba is push"" would be created. But I don't see a ""push"" text block. Unless ""push"" is part of another rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""key"" to near the ""win"" rule to make ""key is win"". Let's see: the ""key"" text block is at 1 step right, and the ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. If I can move the ""key"" text block to near the ""win"" rule and combine it with an ""is"" rule, then ""key is win"" would be created. For example, move the ""key"" rule to be next to an ""is"" rule and the ""win"" rule.

The ""is"" rule near me is at 1 left and 2 down. So if I can move the ""key"" text block (which is at 1 right) to be next to that ""is"" and the ""win"" rule, then ""key is win"" would be formed. Let's plan the steps:

1. Move from current position (baba's rule at 2 left, 1 down) to the ""key"" text block at 1 right. That would require moving right once.

2. Once adjacent to the ""key"" text block, move it towards the ""is"" rule at 1 left and 2 down. But to do that, I need to move it left past my current position. Wait, if I'm at 1 right, moving left to 0 right, then to -1 left (which is 1 left), placing the ""key"" rule next to the ""is"" rule at 1 left and 2 down.

3. Once the ""key"" is adjacent to the ""is"" rule, combine them with the ""win"" rule. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up, which is far away. This seems impractical.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer ""is"" rule. Looking at the objects, there's an ""is"" rule at 7 right and 3 up (part of ""door is win""). If I can move the ""key"" text block next to that ""is"" and the ""win"" rule, creating ""key is win"". But the distance is too great.

This seems difficult. Maybe another approach: since the door is a win condition, and I'm Baba, if I can reach the door, I win. But the door is at 4 right, blocked by a wall at 3 right and 1 down. If I can move that wall, perhaps by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule.

To move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to find the text block that says ""wall is stop"". It's at 2 left and 4 up. If I can move that text block away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Let's see how to do that.

My current position is at the 'baba' rule (2 left, 1 down). To reach the ""wall is stop"" rule at 2 left and 4 up, I need to move up four steps. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at 3 right and 2 up is a wall. So moving up from 2 left, 1 down to 2 left, 4 up would require passing through steps with walls. This might not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to push the wall. But without a ""push"" rule, I can't. Unless I create one.

This is really tricky. Let's think about the possible actions. The available actions are idle, up, down, left, right. Given the current observation, what's the best single action to take?

Looking at the map, if I move down from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The objects list a wall at 3 right and 2 down, but that's to the right of my current position. So moving down should be possible. Then, from there, move right towards the key.

Alternatively, move right once to get to 1 right, then see if I can move the ""key"" text block from there. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the ""key"" text block","

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are still wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. So I can move around unless I hit a wall, which stops me. My goal is to get to the door, which is the win condition.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need to pick up the key to unlock something? But the door is at 4 steps to the right, same as the key. Wait, the door is directly to the right of me, but I might be blocked by walls. Let me check the map again.

The rule 'you' is at 1 step down, 2 steps to the left from Baba. So I'm currently controlling Baba. The walls are placed in a way that there's a structure blocking the path to the door. The key is down at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. If I go down there, maybe I can get the key and then use it? But how does the key work here? Is there a lock on the door? The door is just a door, and the rule says door is win, so touching it should win. But maybe the door is behind a wall or requires the key to be unlocked.

Wait, looking at the object positions: the door is at 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so maybe I need to move past that. But how? If I move right, I hit the wall at 3 steps right. So I need to find a way around. The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. If I can get down there, pick up the key, maybe there's a rule that allows using the key to open the door. But the current rules don't mention a key property. Maybe I need to create a new rule, like key is unlock or something. But to do that, I need to move the 'key' text block and combine it with 'is' and 'unlock' or 'door'.

But first, I need to reach the key. To get to the key at 4 steps right and 2 down, I have to move down from my current position. Let me check my current position. The rule 'baba' is at 2 step left and 1 step down. So I'm currently 2 steps left and 1 step down from the starting position? Or relative to some other reference. Maybe I'm in a specific location on the grid. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the reference point is where the 'baba' rule is, which is 2 left and 1 down. So my position is 2 steps left and 1 step down from that rule. But maybe it's better to think in terms of the grid. The walls are arranged in a pattern. The key is at 4 right and 2 down from somewhere. Let's see:

The key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down from the 'baba' rule's position (which is 2 left and 1 down). So maybe my current position is such that moving right 4 steps would get me to the key's x-coordinate, but I need to go down 2 steps as well. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, so moving right directly is blocked. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move down first to avoid the walls. Let's see the objects around me. The rule 'you' is 1 step left and 1 step down from Baba. So if I move down, I can get to that 'you' rule. But moving down from my current position (assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's location) would take me to 2 left and 2 down. Are there walls there? There's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, but that's to the right of me. So moving down might be possible if there's no wall blocking. 

Wait, the objects list includes walls at various positions. For example, wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So if I'm at 2 left and 1 down (Baba's position), moving down would take me to 2 left and 2 down. There's a wall at 3 right and 2 down, which is to the right of that position. So moving down from Baba's position would lead me to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at 3 steps right in various directions, but not specifically at 2 left and 2 down. So maybe I can move down safely.

Once I move down, I can check if there's a path. Let's think step by step. My goal is to reach the door at 4 right. The current path is blocked by walls at 3 right. So maybe I need to push those walls? But the rule says wall is stop, so I can't push them unless there's a rule allowing it. Since the default is wall is stop, I can't move past them unless I change the rule. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the wall passable. For example, if I can move the 'wall' text block and combine it with 'is' and 'stop' to break that rule. Wait, but the active rules are wall is stop, door is win, and baba is you. To break the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to move the 'wall' rule somewhere else or overwrite it. 

But to do that, I need to be able to move the text blocks. The only movable objects are those not defined as stop. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', and there's no 'stop' on Baba, I can move. So if I can reach the 'wall' rule at 2 left and 4 up, maybe I can move it. But how do I get there? The path is blocked by walls above. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to create a new rule. If I pick up the key and combine it with 'is' and 'unlock' or something, but the key's rule is at 4 right and 2 down. To get there, I need to move right and down. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, to go right from my current position, I hit the wall at 3 right. So maybe I need to move down first, then right around the wall. 

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move down to avoid the wall blocking the right path.
2. From there, move right until I can go around the wall.
3. Retrieve the key.
4. Use the key to create a new rule, like 'door is unlock' or 'key is open', allowing me to pass through the door.

But how to execute this? Let's see.

Current position: Assuming Baba is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 2 left and 3 step up? Wait, the initial observations show that the 'baba' rule is at various positions as the player moves. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to focus on the latest observation.

In the latest observation, the 'baba' rule is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down. The 'you' rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So my position is likely at the 'baba' entity, which is a tile that says ""BABA"". So if I'm on that tile, moving left would take me to the 'is' rule at 1 left and 1 down. But I need to check the map layout.

The walls are at 3 steps right in various up/down positions. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. The door is at 4 right. So if I can get to the key, maybe I can create a new rule that makes the door passable with the key. For example, 'key is unlock' and 'door is lock', so combining them would allow passing. But first, I need to move the key rule and the door rule.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the door is the win condition, maybe I can change the 'win' rule to be Baba instead of door. If I can move the 'win' rule to Baba, then touching Baba would win. But how?

The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. To move that, I need to navigate there, but again, walls block the path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can destroy the 'stop' rule for walls. If I can remove 'wall is stop', then walls become passable. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away or overwrite it. The 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that rule, I could make walls not stop.

But all these require moving text blocks, which I can do if I'm not stopped. So the plan is:

1. Move to the location of the 'key' to get it.
2. Use the key to create a new rule that interacts with the door.
3. Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to Baba.

But getting to the key is the first step. Let's see how to reach the key at 4 right and 2 down.

From the current position (baba at 2 left, 1 down), moving down once would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed include wall 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So from 2 left, 2 down, moving right would take me to 1 left (relative?), but there's a wall at 3 right, which is further right. So maybe moving right from 2 left, 2 down is possible until I hit the wall at 3 right.

Wait, perhaps the coordinate system is such that each step is in a direction from the reference point. This is getting a bit unclear. Let's try to map it out.

Assuming the reference point is the 'baba' rule's position (2 left, 1 down), then:

- Moving right from there would increase the x-coordinate.
- Moving up would decrease the y-coordinate (since up is negative y perhaps).

But the walls are at positions like 3 steps right and 4 step up from the 'baba' rule. So the wall is at x=3, y=-4 (if up is negative). The key is at x=4, y=-2. The door is at x=4, y=0.

So the path from baba's position (0,0) to the key (4,-2) is blocked by walls at x=3, y=-4 (above) and other walls. To get to the key, I need to move down to y=-1, then right to x=4.

But moving down from (0,0) to (0,-1). Is that possible? There's a wall at x=3, y=-2, but that's to the right. So moving down to (0,-1) should be okay. Then from there, move right. Each step right from x=0 to x=1, x=2, x=3, but there's a wall at x=3, y=-1 (from the observation: wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up? Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up would be at x=3, y=1. Not sure about the coordinate system here. This is getting too confusing without a visual.

Alternative approach: Look for the key and see if I can reach it by moving down and then right, avoiding walls. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. From my current position (baba's rule at 2 left, 1 down), moving down once gets me to 2 left, 2 down. Then moving right three times would get me to 4 left? Wait, no. If moving right from 2 left, each step right increases the x by 1. So moving right three times from 2 left would get to x= -1, 0, 1, 2? I'm getting mixed up.

Perhaps I should prioritize moving down to reach the 'you' rule, which is adjacent, then see if I can move right around the walls. Alternatively, try to move down to 1 step down and see if I can find a path.

In the previous steps, the assistant tried moving down, up, right, etc., but the environment kept resetting. Maybe the key is necessary, and to get it, I have to navigate to its location, which requires moving past certain walls by repositioning rules.

Another idea: since the door is the win condition, maybe I can make Baba the win by changing the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that rule to Baba, then touching Baba would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'win' text block to where Baba is. But how?

Baba's position is at the 'baba' rule, which is at 2 left and 1 down. So if I can move the 'win' rule to that position, then 'baba is win' would be active, making touching Baba win. To move the 'win' rule, I need to be able to carry it. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move text blocks that aren't stopped. The 'win' rule is a text block, so if I can reach it, I can move it.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right and 3 up from the 'baba' rule's position. So from my current position (2 left, 1 down), moving up 3 steps would take me to 2 left, 4 down (if up is negative), but the 'win' is at 8 right and 3 up, which would be x=8, y=-3 relative to the 'baba' rule. That's quite far. There are walls along the way, so it's probably not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the key is required to unlock the door. If I pick up the key and then create a rule like 'key is unlock' and 'door is lock', then combining them would allow passing. But to do that, I need to move the key rule and door rule together.

But first, I need to get the key. Let's focus on that. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. From my current position (assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's location), moving down twice would get me to 2 left, 3 down. Then moving right four times would reach 4 right, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 right and 2 down, which might block the path. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is in a position that requires moving around the walls by reassigning rules. For example, if I can make the wall passable by changing the 'wall is stop' rule, then I can move through the walls. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that rule away, then walls would no longer be stop. 

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the 'stop' rule at 3 step up.
2. Move the 'stop' rule elsewhere, say, push it down.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.
4. Go to the door and win.

But how to move the 'stop' rule? To do that, I need to be able to carry the 'stop' text block. Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move it if it's not stopped. The 'stop' rule is a text block, so unless there's a 'stop' property on it, I can move it. But the active rule is 'wall is stop', not 'stop is stop'. So the 'stop' rule itself isn't stopped; it's the walls that are stopped. Therefore, I can pick up the 'stop' rule and move it.

So the plan is:

- Move up to reach the 'stop' rule at 3 step up.
- Move the 'stop' rule away, say, down one step.
- Now, walls are no longer stopped, so I can walk through them.
- Proceed to the door and win.

Let's check if this is possible. From the current observation, the 'stop' rule is at 3 step up. So from my current position (assuming it's at the 'baba' rule's location, which is 2 left and 1 down), moving up three steps would get me to 2 left and 4 down (if up is negative). Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting too confusing without a clear map.

Alternatively, in the latest observation, the 'stop' rule is at 4 step up. So from the 'baba' rule's position (2 left, 1 down), moving up four steps would reach the 'stop' rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up. So moving up while avoiding walls might be tricky.

This is quite challenging without a visual representation. Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, perhaps the best immediate action is to move down towards the key's location, hoping to reach it and then create a new rule. Alternatively, try to move the 'stop' rule to make walls passable.

But given the previous attempts led to the environment resetting, maybe I need to try a different approach. Let's think: the door is at 4 right. If I can push the door rule somewhere else, maybe make it require a key. For example, 'door is key'. Then, if I have the key, touching the door would win. But how to do that?

To change the 'door is win' rule to 'door is key', I need to move the 'win' part. The 'win' rule is separate, at 8 right and 3 up. So if I can move the 'win' rule to the key's location or combine them.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'key is win', making the key the win condition. Then, picking up the key would win. But the default is door is win, so I need to replace that.

This requires moving the 'door is win' rule and the 'key is win' rule. But how?

Maybe the solution is to move the 'win' rule to the key's position. The 'win' rule is at 8 right and 3 up. The key is at 4 right and 2 down. So I need to move the 'win' rule from (8,3) to (4,2). That would require a series of moves, but the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, the assistant might need to simply move towards the door, hoping that by changing the rules dynamically. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think the most plausible action now is to move towards the key to retrieve it, then use it to create a new rule. The","

Let's try to figure out what the correct action here is. The current active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"", and ""baba is you"". So, as Baba, I can move around, but walls stop me. The goal is to reach the door, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. To get the key, I might need to move down or right. But first, I need to check where Baba is located. The rule ""baba"" is at 2 steps to the left and 1 step down. So, Baba's position is 2 left and 1 down from the reference point.

The key is at 4 right, 2 down. Currently, from Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), moving towards the key would require moving right and down. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me map this out:

Baba is at 2 left, 1 down. To get to the key at 4 right, 2 down, the path would be:

- Right twice (from 2 left to 0 left, then to right?), but I need to check the walls. There's a wall at 3 steps to the right in several positions. Let's see:

Looking at the wall positions:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right (base level)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down

So, all positions 3 steps to the right in various directions are walls. That means moving right from Baba's position (which is 2 left, 1 down) would take me towards the walls. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. The positions are relative. Let's clarify:

The rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, if the reference point is maybe the top-left corner, then moving right would increase the x-coordinate, and down increases the y-coordinate.

But the walls are consistently at 3 steps to the right in various ups and downs. So, if I try to move right from Baba's position, I might hit a wall at 3 steps right. For example, moving right once would take me to 1 left, 1 down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 steps right and 2 down from Baba's position. Wait, the key's position is listed as ""key 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down"" in some previous observations, but in the current one, it's ""key 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down"". So, from Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), moving right 4 steps would get to the key's x-coordinate, but the y-coordinate is 2 down. So, need to move down twice.

But the problem is the walls. Let's see the path:

From Baba's position (2 left, 1 down):

- To get to the key at 4 right, 2 down:

1. Move right twice to get to 0 left (since 2 left + 2 right = 0 left). But between there and 4 right, there's a wall at 3 steps right. So moving right beyond 3 steps would hit a wall.

2. Alternatively, maybe move down first. From 1 down to 2 down, which is where the key is vertically. Then move right. But moving right from 2 left, 2 down would require going through 1 left, 2 down; 0 left, 2 down; then 1 right, 2 down, etc. But the walls at 3 steps right would block moving further right beyond that.

Wait, the walls at 3 steps right are in various directions. For example, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up, which is far up. But closer to Baba's position, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, and 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So, if I move down to 2 down, then try to move right past 3 steps right, I hit a wall. Therefore, the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, but that's blocked by a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down.

Hmm, so maybe the key is unreachable unless there's a way to move around the walls. Alternatively, perhaps the key isn't necessary right now. The door is at 4 steps to the right. From Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), moving right 4 steps would get to the door's x-coordinate (since door is at 4 steps right). But vertically, the door is at 1 step down. So, from Baba's position (1 down), moving right 4 steps and then up or down to reach the door.

But let's check the path:

- Moving right from 2 left to 4 right would require passing through 3 steps right, which is a wall. So that path is blocked. Therefore, can't go straight right.

Alternative path: Move down to 2 down, then try to move right. But as before, at 3 steps right and 2 down is a wall. So, can't get past that.

Wait, maybe the key is a red herring. The door is at 4 steps right, 1 step down. If I can get there without the key, that would be better. But how?

From Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), moving right 4 steps would get to the door's x-coordinate (since door is at 4 steps right). But vertically, the door is at 1 step down, which is the same as Baba's current y-position. So, moving right from 2 left to 4 right would require moving right twice (since 2 left + 2 right = 0 left, then another 4 steps right would be 4 right total?), but that seems off. Maybe the coordinate system is relative.

Alternatively, perhaps the door is at 4 steps to the right from Baba's current position. So, if Baba is at position (x, y), the door is at (x + 4, y). But there's a wall at x + 3, y. So moving right from x to x+1, x+2, then hit the wall at x+3. Can't proceed further.

Therefore, to reach the door, need to find a way around the walls. Maybe moving up or down first.

Looking at the map, there's a rule `key` at 2 step up. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `key` is at 2 step up. So, perhaps the key is part of a rule, not an actual key object? Or maybe the key is a text block that can be moved.

Wait, in Baba Is You, sometimes objects like keys are represented by text blocks. So, the key here might be a text block that says ""key"", which can be moved if it's not stopped by a ""stop"" property.

But the active rules are ""wall is stop"", meaning any object with the ""stop"" property can't be moved. Looking at the objects, the walls are all stopped, but the key is just a rule `key` at 2 step up. So, maybe the key is a movable object.

If I can move the key to a different position, perhaps I can use it to unlock something, but in the current rules, the door is ""win"", so just reaching it is enough. However, the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make walls not stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I could move through them. But to do that, I need to interact with the text blocks forming the rules.

The current rules are:

- wall is stop (at 2 left, 4 up)
- is at 1 left, 4 up
- stop at 4 up

So, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" arranged horizontally. To break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. However, the text blocks that are part of active rules can be moved unless they are protected by ""stop"" or similar.

But the ""wall"" text block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since ""wall"" is not stopped (the rule is ""wall is stop"", so ""wall"" itself isn't stopped, only the combination makes it a stop). So, perhaps I can move the ""wall"" text block to break the rule.

The ""wall"" text block is located at 2 step to the left and 4 step up. If I move it, say, to the right, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, changing the rule to something else, maybe ""wall is [nothing]"" or another property.

Similarly, if I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"", then touching the door would make me win.

So, possible strategies:

1. Move the ""wall"" text block to eliminate the ""wall is stop"" rule, allowing movement through walls.
2. Move the ""you"" text block to make Baba something else, perhaps the key or door, so that interacting with them has different effects.
3. Create a new rule like ""baba is win"" or ""door is you"" to achieve victory.

Given the current position of the ""you"" rule (1 step down, 1 step left from Baba's position?), maybe I can reach it and move it.

Baba's position is at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the observation says: ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So, from the reference point (maybe the top-left corner), Baba is 2 steps left and 2 down. But the active rules mention ""baba is you"", which is formed by the text blocks at 2 left, 1 down (rule `baba`), 1 left, 1 down (rule `is`), and 1 right, 1 down (rule `you`).

So, the ""baba is you"" rule is a horizontal arrangement: ""baba"" [2 left, 1 down], ""is"" [1 left, 1 down], ""you"" [0 left, 1 down]. To break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. For example, moving the ""you"" text block to a different position would change the rule.

The ""you"" text block is at 1 step down and 1 step left relative to Baba's position? Wait, the exact positions are:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down

rule `you` 2 steps down

So, all three are aligned vertically, 2 steps down from the reference point. But the exact positions relative to each other:

- ""baba"" is 2 left, 2 down

- ""is"" is 1 left, 2 down

- ""you"" is at 0 left (same as reference), 2 down

So, the rule ""baba is you"" is a vertical rule: ""baba"" above ""is"" above ""you"". To break this, I need to move one of these blocks.

If I can move the ""you"" block down, then the rule would no longer be ""baba is you"", perhaps becoming ""baba is [nothing]"" or another arrangement.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" into a horizontal line.

The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 step up, which is far away. So, moving ""win"" to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"" would create ""baba is win"".

But the distance is a problem. From Baba's position, moving right would hit walls. Maybe moving downward first.

Alternatively, focus on breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall"" text block is at 2 left, 4 up. To reach it, Baba would need to move up and left, but there are walls in the way.

For example, to get to the ""wall"" text block at 2 left, 4 up:

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up twice would get to 2 left, 0 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up, which is in a different direction. Maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""wall is stop"" rule is on the top part of the map. To reach it, Baba would have to navigate past the walls. But given the walls at 3 steps right in various positions, it's challenging.

Another angle: The door is at 4 steps right. If I can make the door a ""win"" by default, but it's already ""door is win"". So that's not helpful.

Wait, the active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"", and ""baba is you"". To win, I just need to reach the door. But the path is blocked by walls. So, maybe I need to remove the ""stop"" property from walls.

To do that, I need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is formed by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" arranged horizontally. The ""wall"" block is at 2 left, 4 up; ""is"" at 1 left, 4 up; ""stop"" at 4 up.

To break this rule, I can move any of these three blocks. For example, moving the ""stop"" block down would break the rule.

The ""stop"" block is at 4 step up. If I can move it, say, to 1 step down, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be deleted, changing walls to not be stop.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? It needs to be pushed unless it's stopped. Since ""wall is stop"", but the ""stop"" block itself isn't stopped unless another rule says so. So, if I can move the ""stop"" block, I can do that by walking into it if it's not stopped.

The ""stop"" block is at 4 step up. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up four steps would reach 4 up, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 3 steps right and 4 up is a wall. So, path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the ""is"" block in the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""is"" block is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move that, the rule would break.

But again, moving it requires getting to that position, which is up 4 steps and left 1 step from Baba's current position, which is blocked by walls.

This seems tricky. Another approach: Create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is stop"" would make Baba a stop, which is bad. Or ""baba is not stop"", but how?

Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" so that touching anything makes Baba win. But to do that, need to arrange ""baba"", ""is"", ""win"" horizontally.

The ""win"" block is at 8 right, 4 up, which is far away. The ""baba"" block is at 2 left, 2 down. The ""is"" block is adjacent to ""baba"".

So, if I can move the ""win"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is"", that would create the rule ""baba is win"".

But moving the ""win"" block from 8 right, 4 up to, say, 1 step right and 2 down (near Baba) would require a lot of steps and avoiding walls.

Alternatively, use the existing ""key"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at 2 step up. If I can make ""baba is key"", then maybe carrying the key allows passage, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, make ""key is you"", so that picking up the key makes Baba you, but he's already you.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Need to reach the door at 4 right.
- Path is blocked by walls at 3 right.
- To remove walls' stop property, need to break ""wall is stop"" rule.
- To break that rule, need to move ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" blocks.
- All these blocks are in the top part of the map, unreachable due to walls.
- Alternative: Create a new rule that makes Baba win upon touching something.
- For example, ""baba is win"" would make touching anything (including walls) win, but that's dangerous.
- Or ""door is you"", making Baba win by touching the door.

To create ""door is you"", need to move ""door"", ""is"", ""you"" into a horizontal line.

The ""door"" block is at 6 right, 4 up. ""is"" is at 1 left, 4 up. ""you"" is at 2 down.

So, moving ""door"" down and right to align with ""is"" and ""you"" would create the rule ""door is you"", making the door a you block, so touching it would make Baba you, but he's already you. Wait, no. If the rule is ""door is you"", then the door is you, so touching it would make Baba you, but he already is you. So that might not help.

Alternatively, ""baba is door"", so Baba becomes the door, and touching the door would make him win.

But to create ""baba is door"", need to move the ""door"" block next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""baba"" block is at 2 left, 2 down. ""is"" is at 1 left, 2 down. So, placing ""door"" next to them horizontally would make ""baba is door"".

The ""door"" block is at 6 right, 4 up. Need to move it down 2 steps and left 4 steps, which is possible if there's a path.

But moving the door block past the walls at 3 right would be difficult. For example, moving it down from 4 up to 2 down (Baba's area) would require navigating around the walls at 3 right.

This seems possible but requires precise movements.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""you"" block to change the ""baba is you"" rule. For example, moving ""you"" to become part of a new rule like ""baba is win"".

The ""win"" block is at 8","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. So, the active rules are still ""wall is stop"", ""door is win"", and ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to reach the door, which is a win, but I need to figure out how to get there.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe I need that key to unlock something? But the door is at 4 steps to the right, same horizontal position as the key but maybe different vertical. Wait, the door is at 4 steps to the right, and the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. So if I go down from the door's position, I'd reach the key. But can I get to the door in the first place?

Looking at the structure, there are walls all around. The rule is ""wall is stop"", so anything labeled as wall can't be moved through. The player (Baba) is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So my position is 2 left, 1 down. The door is 4 steps to the right. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, so maybe a path that isn't blocked?

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I might need to move right from my current position. Let me map out the possible movement. From my position (2 left, 1 down), if I move right, I can go to 1 left, 1 down. Then right again to same level as the door (4 right) but maybe blocked by walls. Let me check the walls:

- There's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up. Not directly in the way down here.
- At 3 steps right and 1 step up, there's a wall. So if I try to go up from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to 2 left, 0 down (which would be 1 step up), but the wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system. The positions are described relative to Baba's location, I think. So ""2 step to the left and 4 step up"" would be relative to Baba.

So Baba's position is reference. Let's say Baba is at (0,0). Then:

- The rule `wall` is at (-2, 4).
- The `is` rule is at (-1,4).
- `stop` rule at (1,4).
- Wall at (3,4).
- Door rule at (6,4), etc.

But maybe it's better to visualize the grid. Let's assume Baba is at position (0,0). Then:

Looking at the objects:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up: (-2,4)
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 4 step up: (-1,4)
- rule `stop` 3 step up: (0,4)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up: (3,4)
- rule `door` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up: (6,4)
- etc.

But this might not be exact. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to Baba's position each time. So each step changes the position by 1 in the direction.

The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down from Baba. So if I can get to that key, maybe I can use it to open the door. But how?

The door is a win, but currently, the rule is ""door is win"", so touching the door would win. But the path might be blocked. Let's see the layout:

Baba is at (0,0) (assuming). To the right, there's a wall at (3,4), but that's way above. Downwards, there's a wall at (3,1) and (3,2), etc. The key is at (4,2). To get there, I need to move right four times? But between Baba's position and the key, there are walls at (3,1), (3,2), etc. So moving right directly might hit those walls.

Wait, the objects list includes:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up: (3,4)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up: (3,2)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up: (3,1)
- wall 3 steps to the right: (3,0)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down: (3,-1)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (3,-2)
- etc.

So the right side from Baba's position (0,0) has walls at (3, y) for various y. That means I can't move right past 3. So to get to the key at (4,2), which is beyond the wall at (3,0), that's impossible unless I can move around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different path. Let's check other objects. There's a rule `key` at 1 step to the right. So (1,0). Maybe I can pick up the key by moving right to (1,0) and then take the key? But how does that help?

Wait, the key is at (4,2). To reach there, I need to move right from (0,0) to (4,0), but there's a wall at (3,0). So I can't get past that. Unless I can manipulate the rules to make the wall not a stop.

The current rules are ""wall is stop"", so any object labeled wall is stop. If I can change the rule to make wall not stop, then I could move through them. But how?

To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, I can move ""wall"" to another property. But the rule parts are separate. The ""wall"" text block is at (-2,4), ""is"" at (-1,4), and ""stop"" at (0,4). So to change ""wall is stop"" to something else, I need to rearrange these text blocks.

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks that are part of the rules. However, some objects might be stop, so I can't move them. Wait, the rule `stop` is at (1,4), which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. But if ""wall is stop"" is a rule, then the ""stop"" text block is part of that rule. But can I move it? The rule says ""wall is stop"", so if I move the ""stop"" text block, it would break the rule. For example, if I move ""stop"" to another position, then the rule becomes ""wall is [empty]"" or something else, which might not be valid.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that overrides the existing one. For example, if I make ""wall is key"", then walls would behave like keys, which might not be stop anymore. But how to do that?

To create a new rule, I need to have the ""baba is you"" rule, which allows me to move text blocks. So as Baba, I can pick up text blocks (subject, verb, property) and place them to form a new rule.

Looking at the current objects, there are several text blocks:

- rule `wall` at (-2,4)
- rule `is` at (-1,4)
- rule `stop` at (0,4)
- rule `door` at (6,4)
- rule `is` at (7,4)
- rule `win` at (8,4)
- rule `baba` at (2 step left, 1 step down): So that's (-2,1)
- rule `is` at (1 step left, 1 step down): (-1,1)
- rule `you` at (1 step down): (0,-1)

So to create a new rule, say ""wall is key"", I would need to move the ""wall"" text block (at -2,4), the ""is"" text block (maybe from another position), and the ""key"" text block (which is at 1 step right, so (1,0)).

But the ""key"" text block is at (1,0). To pick it up, I need to move right to (1,0), which is possible. Then, move ""is"" from (-1,1) or (7,4), and ""wall"" from (-2,4). Then place them in the order [Subject] IS [Property].

But this requires navigating past walls. Let's think step by step.

First, current position of Baba: 2 step left and 1 step down from where? Maybe the initial position is somewhere, but based on the observations, Baba's position is indicated by the rule `baba` at 2 step left and 1 step down. So relative to that, other objects are positioned.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are all relative to Baba's current position. So each time the observation is given, the positions are relative to where Baba is standing.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to focus on possible actions.

The immediate goal is to get to the door, which is at 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall blocking the path. To bypass the wall, we might need to change the rule so that walls aren't stop.

To do that, we need to manipulate the ""wall is stop"" rule. The components of this rule are the ""wall"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""stop"" text block. If we can move these text blocks to form a different rule, like ""wall is you"" or ""stop is win"", that could change the behavior.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba have the ability to move through walls. For example, ""baba is stop"" would make Baba a stop, which is bad, but ""baba is key"" or something else.

But first, let's see where the text blocks are located.

From the observation:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up: So this is the ""wall"" text block, part of the ""wall is stop"" rule.
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 4 step up: The ""is"" text block for that rule.
- rule `stop` 4 step up: The ""stop"" text block, completing the ""wall is stop"" rule.
- Other ""is"" text blocks at different positions, like 1 step left and 1 step down for ""baba is you"".
- The ""you"" text block is at 1 step down.

So to change ""wall is stop"" to something else, we need to move these text blocks. For example, take the ""wall"" text block, move it to another property, say ""key"", using an ""is"" text block and the ""key"" property.

The ""key"" text block is at 1 step right (relative to Baba's position). So if I can move right to get to the ""key"" block, then use it to create a new rule.

But moving right is blocked by walls at 3 steps right. So unless we can remove those walls by changing their rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at a position that's reachable. The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to move right four times, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So that's impossible unless the wall isn't a stop anymore.

So the plan is: change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is key"", making walls behave like keys, which might not be stop. Then move through the walls.

To do that:

1. Move the ""wall"" text block (at -2,4) to a new position.
2. Use an ""is"" text block (maybe from -1,1 or 7,4) to connect.
3. Use the ""key"" text block (at 1,0) as the new property.

But how to do this step by step.

First, I need to navigate to the ""key"" text block at 1 step right. From Baba's position (which is at 2 step left and 1 step down relative to where?), moving right once would get to 1 step left. Then right again to same level as the key's x-coordinate (assuming the key is 1 step right from Baba). Wait, the key is at 1 step right, so moving right once gets there.

So action: right.

Once at the key's position, can I pick up the ""key"" text block? Since the rule is ""key is [property]"", but there's no rule defined for key yet. So maybe I can drag it elsewhere.

But to create a new rule, I need to have the ""wall"" text block, an ""is"", and the ""key"" text block.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" text block from 1 step left and 1 step down (-1,1) to connect the ""wall"" and ""key"".

So the steps could be:

1. Move right to get to the ""key"" text block.
2. Move the ""is"" text block to connect ""wall"" and ""key"".

But this requires careful movement.

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't necessary. If I can make myself (Baba) a stop, then I could move through walls. But ""baba is stop"" would make me a stop, which is bad because stops can't be moved through. So that's not helpful.

Another idea: If I can make ""you"" equivalent to ""win"", then touching anything labeled ""you"" would win. Since Baba is ""you"", that would mean touching Baba himself would make me win. But how to do that.

The current ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. If I can change that to ""win"", then ""you is win"", making Baba win upon touching himself. But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block and rearrange the rule.

For example, take the ""you"" text block (at 0,-1), move it to the position of the ""win"" rule, and adjust the ""is"" text block.

But this also requires navigating to those positions.

Given the complexity, perhaps the immediate action is to try to move towards the key or the door, but being blocked by walls. Since previous attempts to move up, down, right, left haven't worked, maybe the solution is to manipulate the rules.

But how to do that when the required text blocks are far away and blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach. The door is a win, but maybe the rule ""door is win"" can be changed. If I can make ""door is stop"", then the door becomes a stop, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is win"", making Baba himself the win condition.

To do that, I need to create the rule ""baba is win"". The components are the ""baba"" text block, ""is"", and ""win"".

The ""baba"" text block is at 2 step left and 1 step down. The ""is"" text block is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The ""win"" text block is at 8 steps right and 4 step up.

So if I can move these three text blocks together to form ""baba is win"", that would make Baba the win condition.

To do that, I need to navigate to each of these text blocks and rearrange them. However, the positions are quite far. For example, the ""win"" text block is at 8 steps right and 4 up, which is far from Baba's current position.

This seems complicated, but perhaps possible with multiple steps.

First, move towards the ""baba"" text block to pick it up. But ""baba"" is part of the ""baba is you"" rule. If I move the ""baba"" text block, the existing rule breaks, but since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can still move it.

Wait, the rule ""baba is you"" means that Baba can be moved, but the text blocks are separate. So physically moving the ""baba"" text block would change the rule.

So perhaps:

1. Move to the ""baba"" text block (2 step left, 1 step down from current position? Or is that Baba's position relative to somewhere else? This is getting confusing. Maybe the coordinates are all relative to Baba's current position each time the observation is given.

Alternatively, perhaps the ""baba"" text block is at a certain position on the grid, and I need to move there to pick it up.

Given the time I've spent and the failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to try to move towards the ""is"" text block that's part of the ""baba is you"" rule, to rearrange the rules.

Alternatively, since the previous actions kept failing, maybe the intended solution is to move down to the key, pick it up, and use it to unlock the door. But how?

The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. To get there, I need to move right four times and down two times. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right. So unless the walls are no longer stops.

This is really tricky. Maybe the answer is to move down to the key's location, pick up the key, and then use it to open the door. But how to do that when the door's rule is ""door is win"".

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the key unlock the door. For example, ""key is door"", but I don't know if that's possible.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll hazard a guess that the correct action is to move down towards the key, even though it's blocked, perhaps assuming that the walls can be manipulated.

Let's try to figure out what's going on here. The game environment just reset because the ""BABA IS YOU"" rule was broken. The current active rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""key is win"". So the win condition has changed to getting the key instead of the door.

Looking at the objects on the map, Baba is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. There's a key at 6 steps to the right. Also, there's a ball object at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. There are walls blocking some paths, specifically at 4 steps to the right in various directions. 

The active rules: ""wall is stop"" means any object labeled as wall can't be moved through. ""key is win"" changes the win condition to touching the key. So my goal now is to reach the key at 6 steps right. 

Baba's current position is 1 step left and 1 step down from some reference point. Let me map out possible moves. To get to the key at 6 steps right, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, so moving right directly might hit a wall. Wait, the key is at 6 steps right, which is past the wall at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to find a way around the wall. 

Looking at other objects: There's a ball at 6 steps right and 3 steps up. Not sure if that's useful. The rule `ball` isn't mentioned, so maybe it's a neutral object. Also, there's a rule `rule 'ball' 1 step to the right and 1 step up`, which means the text block saying ""BALL IS..."" is located there. 

Since the rules can be manipulated by moving text blocks, maybe I can change the rules to bypass the walls. For example, if I can make the ball a ""STOP"" or remove the ""STOP"" property from walls, that might help. But first, I need to reach those text blocks. 

Baba's position is 1 step left and 1 step down. If I move right twice, I can get to 3 steps right. From there, maybe move up to avoid the wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the wall at 4 steps right is at different heights. The wall at 4 steps right is at 4 steps up, 3 step up, 2 step up, 1 step up, and base level. So maybe moving up past the wall? 

Alternatively, since the key is at 6 steps right, perhaps there's a way to move around the wall by going down. Let's see: from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right three times gets to 4 steps right, but that's where the wall is. If I move right to 4 steps right, then up to 3 step up, but there's a wall there. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe I can use the rule blocks to create a new rule. The rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule to create something like ""BALL IS YOU"" or ""BALL IS WIN"", but the goal is to get the key. Alternatively, changing ""key is win"" back to ""door is win"" if possible. But that might not help. 

Alternatively, if I can make the wall not a stop by moving its rule. The rule `wall` is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop. But to do that, I need to be able to move the rule block, which requires that the object it's attached to isn't a stop. Since the rule itself isn't a stop unless defined. 

But Baba is ""you"", so I can move objects that aren't stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But I can move text blocks that are not stop. The rule `wall` is a text block; if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop"", so any wall (the object, not the rule) is stop. But the rule `wall` is a text block. Since the rule says ""wall is stop"", does that apply to the text block as well? Probably not. Text blocks are separate; their movement is only blocked if they have a ""stop"" property. 

But in this reset state, the active rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""key is win"". So text blocks might still be movable unless they are defined as stop. Let me check the objects. The rule `wall` is at 1 left, 4 up. There's no rule saying that text blocks are stop, so I can move them. 

So the plan is: move the rule `wall` to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule, which would make walls no longer stop. Then, navigate through the walls to get to the key. Alternatively, find another way to reach the key using the available rules. 

But first, how to get to the rule `wall` at 1 left, 4 up. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving up three steps gets to 4 up, which is where the rule `wall` is. But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. To reach 1 left, 4 up, need to move up three times. But between there, are there any walls? The wall at 4 steps right is at various positions, but Baba is on the left side. So maybe the path is clear. 

So action sequence: up, up, up to reach the rule `wall`. Then, take the rule `wall` and move it away to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can go through them. Then move right to the key. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. If I can make the key a ""YOU"" rule, then touching it would make me the key, but the goal is to be the key? Wait, the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key wins. So maybe I just need to reach the key. 

But the problem is the walls blocking the path. So perhaps the best approach is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the corresponding text block. 

So step by step:

1. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), move up three times to reach the rule `wall` at 1 left, 4 up.
2. Grab the rule `wall` and move it down or in another direction to remove it from the active rules.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so navigate through them to reach the key at 6 steps right.
4. Move right past the walls to get to the key.

Alternatively, check if there's another rule that can be manipulated. The rule `key` is at 7 steps right and 4 up. The rule says ""key is win"". If I can change that to ""key is you"", then touching the key would make me the key, but the goal is to be the key? Wait, no. The goal is to touch the key because ""key is win"". So changing that rule wouldn't help unless the win condition is changed. 

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", but that's not necessary. The current goal is to touch the key. 

So the main obstacle is the walls. Removing the ""wall is stop"" rule seems essential. 

So the first action is to move up to reach the rule `wall`. Let's confirm the movement:

Baba's position: 1 step left and 1 step down from the reference point (probably the center). To get to the rule `wall` at 1 left, 4 up, need to move up three times. Each move up should be possible if there's no wall in the way. 

Assuming no walls between Baba and the rule `wall`, the next action should be up. 

So the first action is up. Then, once at the rule `wall`, move it. But how to indicate moving the rule? The allowed actions are idle, up, down, left, right. So to move the rule, the agent needs to move in the direction of the rule's location and then perhaps interact? Wait, in Baba Is You, you move yourself and can push text blocks by moving into them if they are not stop. 

Since the rule `wall` is a text block, and currently, walls (the objects) are stop, but text blocks aren't stop unless defined. So the rule `wall` can be moved as long as it's not under a stop property. 

So to move the rule `wall`, Baba needs to move into it while pushing. For example, if Baba is to the left of the rule `wall`, he can move right into it, pushing it further right. 

But in this case, the rule `wall` is at 1 left, 4 up. Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. So the rule is above Baba. To reach it, Baba needs to move up three times. Once he's at 1 left, 4 up (same position as the rule), he can then move the rule by pushing it. 

But how to represent that in the allowed actions? The actions are single steps: up, down, left, right, idle. So each action is a single movement. 

So the sequence would be:

1. Up (three times) to reach the rule `wall`.
2. Then, move in a direction to push the rule `wall` away. For example, move right to push it right, removing it from the active rules.

But in the current observation, after moving up three times, Baba would be at the same position as the rule `wall` (1 left, 4 up). Then, moving right would push the rule `wall` to 2 left, 4 up. That would remove the ""wall is stop"" rule from the active rules, since the text block is no longer in the long-term context. 

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so Baba can move through them. Then, navigate to the key at 6 steps right. 

So the first action is to move up three times. But since each action is a single step, the first action should be up.

Let's take a look at the current game state. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, normally, touching a wall stops me, the key is the win condition instead of the door, and I'm controlled as Baba.

Now, the objects on the map. Let me parse their positions. 

There's a rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. Then a rule `is` at 3 steps up. Another `stop` rule 1 step to the right and 3 steps up. A wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Then a rule `key` at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up, followed by `is` and `win` rules, which makes sense because key is win now. The wall continues down to 4 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a ball at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Another rule `ball` at 1 step right. Then more walls down.

Baba is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. The `is` rule is at 2 steps down, and `you` is 1 step right and 2 steps down. So, combining the rules: baba is you, so I'm Baba and can move. The key is now the win object, located at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The door isn't here anymore; instead, grabbing the key will make me win.

Looking at my position (Baba at 1 left, 2 down), I need to get to the key at 6 right, 1 down. The path seems blocked by walls. Let's see the layout:

- Up: There's a wall 3 steps up, but maybe I can move around. The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. The rule for ball is at 1 right, so maybe ball has some property? Not sure yet.

- To the right: There's a wall at 4 steps right, so I can't go straight right. The key is at 6 right and 1 down. So maybe move down first?

If I move down from my current position (2 steps down), I'd be at 3 steps down. There's a wall there. So that's blocked. Maybe move right step by step, avoiding walls. Let's see:

From current position (1 left, 2 down):

- Move right: to 0 left, 2 down. Is there a wall? The wall is at 4 steps right, so 0 left is my original position? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. Let's clarify the positions.

Assuming Baba's position is reference. The objects are positioned relative to Baba. So, for example, ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" means that relative to Baba's current position, the wall is 1 left, 3 up.

So Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- rule `wall` is at (-1, 3)
- rule `is` at (0,3)
- rule `stop` at (1,3)
- wall at (4,3)
- rule `key` at (7,3)
- etc.

Baba's position is ( -1, -2 ) because the rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from his position. Wait, no, the rule `baba` is positioned relative to Baba. So if the rule `baba` is 1 step left and 2 steps down, that means Baba is 1 step right and 2 steps up from that rule's position. So the rule is at Baba's position minus (1 left, 2 down). So if the rule is at ( -1, -2 ), then Baba is at (0, 0) because the rule is 1 left and 2 down from him.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to map it out.

The rule `baba` is located at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from Baba's position. So if the rule is at position (x, y), then Baba is at (x + 1, y + 2).

Looking at the objects:

rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So relative to Baba's position, that rule is at (-1, -2). Therefore, Baba is at (0, 0).

Now, other objects:

- rule `wall` is at (-1, 3) → 1 left, 3 up from Baba.
- rule `is` at (0,3)
- rule `stop` at (1,3)
- wall at (4,3)
- rule `key` at (7,3)
- etc.

The key is at (6,1) because the rule `key` is at 7 right and 1 down, which would be (7, -1) relative to Baba's position (0,0), so the key itself is at (7, -1).

Wait, no. The rule `key` is an object that defines key is win. The key's position is separate. The rule `key` is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps up from Baba's position. So the rule is at (7,3), and the key object is probably nearby. But in the objects list, there's a key at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. So the key is at (6, -1).

So the goal is to reach (6, -1).

Baba is at (0,0). The path to (6,-1):

Looking at the walls:

- At (4,3) there's a wall. So moving up from (0,0) to (4,3) is blocked.
- The wall at (4,3) is a stop, so touching it would stop me.
- The ball is at (6,2), which might be movable if it's not stop. The rule `ball` is at (1,0), which could mean ball is a certain property. But since the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you, the ball's property isn't defined. So maybe ball is pushable?

But I need to get from (0,0) to (6,-1). Let's see possible routes.

Option 1: Move down to avoid the upper walls.

From (0,0), move down to (0,-1). But looking at the objects, at wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up → that's (4,1). Not directly in the way. Then down to (0,-1). There's a key at (6,-1), which is down and to the right.

But how to get there without hitting walls. Let's check the walls around:

- At (4,3) is a wall up high, but down at (4,-1) there's a wall as well (wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down is (4,-2)). So from (0,-1), moving right towards 6,-1, but there's a wall at (4,-2) which is two steps down from the wall at (4,3). So the path from (0,-1) to (6,-1) would have to go around the wall at (4,-2).

Wait, perhaps moving right step by step:

From (0,0):

1. Move down to (0,-1).
2. Move right to (1,-1). Is there a wall? The wall at (4,-1) is further right. So (1,-1) is clear.
3. Move right to (2,-1). Clear.
4. Move right to (3,-1). Clear.
5. Move right to (4,-1). There's a wall at (4,-1)? Looking at the objects: wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down is (4,-1). Yes, so can't move into (4,-1). So need to go around.

If I can't go straight right past (4,-1), maybe move down further to avoid the wall.

From (4,-1) is a wall. So maybe move from (3,-1) down to (3,-2). Is there a wall there? The wall at (4,-2) is two steps down from (4,-1). So (3,-2) is clear. Then move right to (4,-2), but that's a wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, after (3,-1), move down to (3,-2), then right to (4,-2) (wall), can't. Then maybe move up again? This seems complicated.

Another approach: Use the ball. The ball is at (6,2). If I can move the ball out of the way, but I'm not sure if I can push it. Since the only moving objects are probably the ones I can move (not stop). The active rules are wall is stop, so walls can't be moved. The ball's rule is at (1,0), which might mean ball is something else. If ball is not stop, I might be able to push it.

But how does pushing work in Baba Is You? You can push objects that are not stop. So if ball is not stop, I can move it by approaching from the side.

But first, I need to reach the ball. From (0,0) to (6,2): that's right and up. But there's a wall at (4,3), which is a stop. So can't go that way.

Alternatively, go down to (6,-1) directly. But the path is blocked by the wall at (4,-1) and (4,-2).

Wait, maybe there's another rule I can manipulate. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. If I can change the rule key is win to door is win, then maybe the door elsewhere becomes the win condition. But I don't see a door in the current objects. Wait, in the previous observation after reset, there was a door, but in the current observation, the objects are:

rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `is` 3 step up
rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 3 step up
wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `key` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 3 step up
wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
ball 6 steps to the right and 2 step up
wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `ball` 1 step to the right
wall 4 steps to the right
wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
key 6 steps to the right and 1 step down
rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `is` 2 steps down
rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So no door here. The win condition is the key. So I have to get to the key at (6,-1).

Another idea: Since the rule key is win is present, maybe I can move that rule somewhere else to make another object win. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule next to the door (if there was one), but there's no door here. Alternatively, move it to Baba, making Baba is win. But the rule ""baba is you"" is already there. If I can change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", then I could win by touching myself. But how?

To do that, I need to reposition the text blocks. The current rules are:

- wall is stop (at (-1,3))
- key is win (at (7,3))
- baba is you (at (-1,-2))

To change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""you"" text block away and add a ""win"" block next to ""baba"".

The ""you"" rule is at (1, -1) relative to Baba's position (0,0), which is the rule `you` 1 step to the right and 1 step down. So the ""you"" text block is at (1, -1).

The ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -2). To make ""baba is win"", I need to have a ""win"" text block next to the ""baba"" rule. So if I can move the ""win"" rule (which is at (9,3)) closer to Baba.

But moving text blocks requires that they are not stopped. The wall is stop, but other objects like rules may be movable if they aren't stopped. The ""key is win"" rule is at (7,3). If I can move that ""win"" block down to near Baba.

But how to move it. Let's see. The ""win"" rule is part of the ""key is win"" rule, which is at (7,3). To separate them, I need to move the ""win"" text block away from the ""key"" and place it next to ""baba"".

But first, I need to navigate to where the ""win"" rule is. From Baba's position (0,0), the ""win"" rule is at (9,3), which is far to the right and up. There's a wall at (4,3), so path is blocked. Unless there's another way.

Alternatively, focus on getting to the key. Let's try to find a path to (6,-1).

From (0,0):

1. Move down to (0,-1).
2. Move right to (1,-1). Check if there's a wall. At (4,-1) there's a wall, but (1,-1) is clear.
3. Move right to (2,-1). Clear.
4. Move right to (3,-1). Clear.
5. Move right to (4,-1). There's a wall here. Can't move right.
6. So instead of going straight right, move down to (3,-2).
7. From (3,-2), move right to (4,-2). There's a wall at (4,-2).
8. Move up to (4,-1) (wall), can't. Move right to (5,-2). Is that clear? The key is at (6,-1), so (5,-2) is adjacent.
9. From (5,-2), move up to (5,-1). Then right to (6,-1), which is the key.

But how to get from (3,-2) to (5,-2):

- From (3,-2), move right to (4,-2) (wall), can't. So move up to (4,-1) (wall), then right to (5,-1), then down to (5,-2). Then right to (6,-2), but the key is at (6,-1). So from (5,-2), move up to (5,-1), right to (6,-1). That works.

But the path requires navigating around walls. Let's outline the steps:

1. Down from (0,0) → (0,-1).
2. Right to (1,-1).
3. Right to (2,-1).
4. Right to (3,-1).
5. Down to (3,-2).
6. Right to (4,-2) (wall), can't. Move up to (4,-1) (wall), then right to (5,-1).
7. Down to (5,-2).
8. Right to (6,-2).
9. Up to (6,-1) (key).

Wait, but the key is at (6,-1), so from (6,-2), moving up gets there. But is (6,-2) clear? The objects listed have a key at (6,-1) and a wall at (4,-2). So (6,-2) should be clear.

This path seems possible. But I need to ensure that each move is valid and doesn't hit a stop wall.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path by moving up first, then right, but the wall at (4,3) blocks that.

Another idea: Use the ball to clear a path. The ball is at (6,2). If I can move the ball down to (6,-1), but that's where the key is. Maybe swap positions? But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe I can just reach it even if there's a wall nearby, as long as I don't touch the wall. But the path requires moving through open spaces.

Given the complexity, perhaps the best immediate action is to move down towards the key, step by step, avoiding walls. So from the current position (0,0), moving down to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1), etc., as outlined earlier.

But let's check the latest observation's active rules and objects again to confirm positions.

Current active rules: wall is stop, key is win, baba is you.

Objects:

- rule `wall` at (-1,3)
- rule `is` at (0,3)
- rule `stop` at (1,3)
- wall at (4,3)
- rule `key` at (7,3)
- rule `is` at (8,3)
- rule `win` at (9,3)
- wall at (4,2)
- ball at (6,2)
- wall at (4,1)
- rule `ball` at (1,0)
- wall at (4,0)
- wall at (4,-1)
- key at (6,-1)
- rule `baba` at (-1,-2)
- rule `is` at (0,-1)
- rule `you` at (1,-1)
- wall at (4,-2)
- wall at (4,-3)

So, the key is at (6,-1), which is directly to the right and down from Baba's position. The path from (0,0) to (6,-1):

- Down to (0,-1)
- Right to (1,-1)
- Right to (2,-1)
- Right to (3,-1)
- Can't go right to (4,-1) because wall.
- Down to (3,-2)
- Right to (4,-2) (wall)
- Up to (4,-1) (wall)
- Right to (5,-1)
- Down to (5,-2)
- Right to (6,-2)
- Up to (6,-1) (key)

I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. Let me look at the current observation.

The active rules are: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, walls stop me, the key makes whatever it's attached to a win condition, and I'm Baba. My goal is probably to reach the key or something that's defined as win, but the key itself is now the win condition. Wait, the active rules say key is win, so picking up the key should make me win? Or maybe standing on it? Let me check the objects.

Looking at the map, there's a key at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. Also, there's a door mentioned earlier, but in the current active rules, door isn't a win anymore; key is win. So I need to get to the key. But how?

The player (Baba) is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the rule 'you' block. Let me visualize the position. If the rules are spread out, maybe I need to move right to reach the key. But there are walls blocking the path. Let's see the objects:

- There's a wall at 4 steps to the right in multiple positions (up, same level, down). So moving directly right from Baba's position (which is 1 step left and 2 steps down) might be blocked by the wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are every 1 step to the right from position 4. So to get to the key at 6 steps right, I need to move past the walls. But how? The walls are marked as stop, so I can't move through them. Unless I can manipulate the rules to make them not stop.

The current active rules are wall is stop. If I can change that rule, maybe I can move through walls. But to change a rule, I need to move the 'is' text block associated with it. Let's look for the rule 'wall is stop'. The 'wall' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up, 'is' is at 3 step up, and 'stop' is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So to break this rule, I would need to move either 'wall', 'is', or 'stop' out of place. But all these objects might be stop, meaning I can't move them unless they're not tagged as stop. Wait, the rule says 'wall is stop', so any wall is stop. But the text blocks themselves might not be walls; they're rules. So maybe the text blocks are movable unless they're part of a rule that makes them stop. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, making 'wall' not stop by rewriting the rule. If I can move the 'is' block away from 'wall' and 'stop', that would break the rule. Let's see. The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of three text blocks: 'wall' at 1 left 3 up, 'is' at 3 up, and 'stop' at 1 right 3 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these. But can I move them? The active rules are wall is stop, so any text block that is a wall (i.e., the rule text 'wall') is stop. So moving the 'wall' rule would be blocked. Same with 'stop'—since it's defined as stop, I can't move it. The 'is' block might be movable unless there's a rule saying it's stop. Since there's no such rule, maybe I can move the 'is' block. If I move 'is' away from 'wall' and 'stop', that would break the 'wall is stop' rule.

So, the plan is: move the 'is' block from 3 step up to somewhere else, thereby breaking the wall is stop rule. Then, the walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to move through them. Once the walls are passable, I can navigate to the key.

But how to do that? Let me check the positions. The 'is' block is at 3 step up. To break the wall is stop rule, I need to separate 'wall' and 'stop' with the 'is' block. For example, move the 'is' block down so that it's not between 'wall' and 'stop'. Let's see where the 'is' block is. The 'is' at 3 step up is between 'wall' (1 left 3 up) and 'stop' (1 right 3 up). If I move the 'is' block to, say, 1 step down, then the rule 'wall is stop' would be broken because the 'is' is no longer between them.

But to move the 'is' block, I need to reach its position. The 'is' is at 3 step up. My current position is rule `baba` at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So from there, how do I get to the 'is' at 3 step up? Let me calculate the steps needed. If I move up three times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, my current position is probably at (x, y) where moving up would take me towards the 'is' block, but there might be obstacles. Alternatively, maybe I can move right first to get past some walls.

Wait, the objects on the map include walls at 4 steps right in various positions. So if I'm at 1 step left and 2 steps down, moving right would take me towards the walls. For example, moving right once gets me to 0 steps left, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. Let me try to visualize the grid.

Assuming Baba's position is at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- rule `baba` is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, so at (-1, -2).
- The 'is' block that's part of the 'wall is stop' rule is at 3 step up, which would be (-1, 2) if the reference is Baba's position.
- The 'stop' rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up, so (0, 3).
- The 'wall' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up, so (-1, 3).

To move the 'is' block (at (-1, 2)), I need to reach that position. From Baba's position (-1, -2), moving up three steps would get me to (-1, 1), then (-1, 2). But along the way, are there any walls? There's a wall at 4 steps right, but that's in the positive x direction. Moving up from (-1, -2) to (-1, 2) doesn't involve moving right, so maybe it's clear. Wait, but the map has walls at 4 steps right in various y positions. So unless there's a wall in the same column, moving up should be possible.

But the active rules say wall is stop, so if there's a wall in the path, I can't move through it. Let's check the objects again. The walls are at 4 steps right and various y positions. So if I'm moving up from (-1, -2) to (-1, 2), I'm moving vertically in the same x column. There's no wall mentioned in that column, except maybe the ones at 4 steps right. So maybe it's possible to move up.

So the plan is:

1. Move up from Baba's position to reach the 'is' block at 3 step up.
2. Once there, move the 'is' block away from the 'wall' and 'stop' rules to break 'wall is stop'.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
4. Then, navigate to the key at 6 steps right and 1 step down, avoiding the walls since they're passable now.

But how to move the 'is' block? Let's see. The 'is' block is at 3 step up from Baba's position. If I move up three times, I can get there. But each move needs to be valid. Let's see:

- Current position: 1 left, 2 down → (-1, -2)
- Move up once: (-1, -1)
- Move up again: (-1, 0)
- Move up again: (-1, 1)
- Move up again: (-1, 2) → reaches the 'is' block.

But along the way, are there any walls? The walls are at 4 steps right, which is far from this column. So movement should be possible.

Once at the 'is' block, I need to move it. The 'is' block is a text block, and unless there's a rule preventing it, I can move it. Since the only active rule is wall is stop, and 'is' isn't a wall, I should be able to move it. So after reaching (-1, 2), move the 'is' block. Where to move it? Maybe one step down to (-1, 3), which is the same row as the 'stop' block. Now the 'wall is stop' rule would be 'wall [is] stop' → which is invalid, breaking the rule.

Once the rule is broken, walls are no longer stop. Then I can move through them. The key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. From Baba's original position (-1, -2), moving right 6 steps would get to (5, -2), but there's a wall at 4 steps right (which is x=4). So after breaking the wall rule, I can move right past x=4.

But the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. Let's see the path:

From (-1, -2) after breaking the wall rule:

- Move right to 0, -2
- Right to 1, -2
- Right to 2, -2
- Right to 3, -2
- Right to 4, -2 (wall was here, but now it's passable)
- Right to 5, -2
- Right to 6, -2 → but the key is at 6 right and 1 down, which is (6, -1). So need to move down from -2 to -1.

So after reaching (6, -2), move down to (6, -1) where the key is. Then, since key is win, standing on it should make me win.

But wait, the key's position is 6 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm at (6, -2) and move down once, I get to (6, -1), which is the key's position. Then, since key is win, I win.

So the steps would be:

1. Up four times to reach the 'is' block.
2. Move the 'is' block down to break the wall is stop rule.
3. Move right past the walls to reach the key.
4. Move down to the key and win.

But how to execute this in the game? Let's map out the actions.

First, from Baba's initial position (1 left, 2 down), the actions needed are:

- up (three times?) Wait, the initial position is 1 step left and 2 steps down. To get to the 'is' block at 3 step up, how many steps up?

Assuming each 'up' action moves one step upward. So from position (x, y), up would be (x, y+1). The 'is' block is 3 steps up from Baba's position. So:

Initial position: let's assume (0,0) for simplicity, but based on the description, Baba is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from the 'you' rule. So maybe the coordinates are relative. Alternatively, perhaps the 'is' block is three steps up from Baba's current position. So the movement would be up three times.

So actions:

up → up → up → up (four times?) Wait, the initial observation says that after some actions, the 'is' you rule was broken and reset. Maybe each up moves one step. So to reach the 'is' block at 3 step up, three up actions.

But in previous steps, when the user tried up, down, right, etc., the environment sometimes reset. So need to be careful.

Alternatively, maybe the 'is' block is in a specific location. Let me check the objects again.

In the current observation, the 'is' block related to wall is stop is at 3 step up. So from Baba's position (which is at rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down), moving up three times should get to that 'is' block.

Once there, move the 'is' block. To move a text block, you have to push it with another movable object, like Baba. Since Baba is 'you', he can push objects that aren't stop. But once the wall is no longer stop, other objects might be movable.

Wait, but initially, walls are stop, so you can't push them. But if I break the wall is stop rule, then walls become passable, but are they still stop? No, because the rule is broken. So after breaking, walls are just normal objects, not stop. So then, I can move them.

But to move the 'is' block, which is not a wall, I can push it. So from the 'is' block's position (3 step up), move it down one step. That would break the wall is stop rule.

Then, I can move right past the walls.

So the sequence would be:

1. Up three times to reach the 'is' block.
2. Move the 'is' block down (push it).
3. Now, walls are passable.
4. Move right to reach the key.

But how to represent this in the actions? Each move is a single direction. To move the 'is' block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction I want to push it.

Assuming that after reaching the 'is' block at 3 step up, I need to move down to push it. Wait, no. The 'is' block is at 3 step up. If I am on the same position as the 'is' block, I can move in any direction, but to push it, I need to be next to it and move in the direction away from me. For example, if I'm on the 'is' block and move down, the 'is' block would move down as well.

So the exact steps would be:

- Move up three times to get to the 'is' block.
- Then, move down once, which would push the 'is' block down, breaking the wall is stop rule.
- Now, walls are no longer stop.
- Move right past the walls to the key's location.

But navigating to the key's position (6 steps right, 1 step down) from the initial position might require several right and down moves.

Alternatively, after breaking the wall rule, move right directly to the key.

But I need to ensure that the path is clear. Since the walls are now passable, I can move through them.

Another thing to consider: the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. From Baba's original position (1 left, 2 down), after breaking the wall rule, moving right 6 steps and down 1 step should get to the key.

So the actions would be:

up (three times) → down (once to move 'is' block) → right (six times) → down (once)

But I need to make sure that each move is valid. For example, after moving up three times and breaking the rule, can I move right past the walls at 4 steps right?

Yes, because walls are no longer stop.

But let me check the key's position again. The key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. So from Baba's new position after breaking the rule (assuming he's at the same position where he pushed the 'is' block), which would be 3 step up from original, then moving right 6 times and down once.

But maybe after pushing the 'is' block down, Baba's position would be where the 'is' block was, which is 3 step up. Then moving right from there.

Alternatively, after moving up three times to reach the 'is' block, then moving down once (both Baba and the 'is' block move down), ending up at 2 step up. Then, from there, move right.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to outline the exact steps:

1. Start at Baba's position: 1 left, 2 down.
2. Move up three times to reach the 'is' block at 3 step up.
   - Action sequence: up, up, up.
3. Now, at the 'is' block. To push it down, move down once.
   - Action: down. This moves both Baba and the 'is' block down to 2 step up.
4. Now, the 'wall is stop' rule is broken. Walls are passable.
5. From current position (2 step up), move right six times to reach 6 steps right.
   - Actions: right, right, right, right, right, right.
6. From there, move down once to reach 1 step down, which is the key's position.
   - Action: down.

Once the key is reached, since key is win, the level is completed.

But I need to ensure that all these moves are possible without hitting any stop objects. However, since after step 4, walls are no longer stop, moving right through them should be allowed.

Another possible issue: when moving the 'is' block, do I need to be adjacent to it? Yes. So after reaching the 'is' block by moving up three times, I need to be on the same tile as the 'is' block. Then, moving down would push it, and also move Baba down.

This sequence should work. Now, translating this into the required actions, each move is a single direction. So the answer should be a series of actions like up, up, up, down, right (six times), down.

But the problem is that the user's previous attempts resulted in the environment resetting when trying to break the rule. So maybe the exact path needs to be precise.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Let's see: if after breaking the wall rule, I can move right directly to the key.

But given the observations, the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. From the initial position, after breaking the wall rule, moving right 6 times and down once should reach the key.

So the final answer is a series of actions: up, up, up, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, down.

But the system might require a single action per step.","

Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get the key because key is the new win condition. I need to move towards the key at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'ball' 1 step to the right. Wait, maybe that's a movable object? Since the rules aren't specifying that ball is stop or anything, maybe I can push it. But how? The player is Baba, who is you. So, I can move around, but walls are stop.

Let me see the player's position. The rule 'baba' is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, Baba is located at 1 left, 2 down from some reference point. The key is at 6 right and 1 down. So, from Baba's position, moving right 5 steps and up 1 step would reach the key. But there might be walls in the way.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps right at various positions. Let me map this out. The walls are at 4 steps right, 3 steps up; 4 right, 2 up; 4 right, 1 up; and 4 right, 1 down. So, the path to the key (6 right, 1 down) from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down) might involve moving right past the walls. Wait, the key is at 6 right, 1 down. So starting at 1 left (which is -1), moving right 6 steps would get to position 5. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 down. So between 4 and 6, there's a gap? Or maybe the key is beyond the wall?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move around using the ball. The ball is at 6 right and 2 up. There's a rule 'ball' 1 step to the right. Maybe I can push the ball to create a path. But how? Since I'm Baba, and the ball isn't a stop, I can move into it. If I move right into the ball, it might push it. Then maybe use the ball to block a wall or reach the key.

Wait, the key is at 6 right and 1 down. The ball is at 6 right and 2 up. If I move the ball down, it could block a wall or help reach the key. Let me check the positions again. The key is 6 right, 1 down. The ball is 6 right, 2 up. So, if I move the ball down once, it would be at 6 right, 1 up. Then I could move down from there to get to the key. But how to move the ball? Since I'm you (Baba), I can move into the ball and push it.

So, the plan is: move down from Baba's position to get to the same level as the ball. Then move right into the ball to push it down. Then move down to the key's position. But let's check the steps.

Baba's position is 1 left and 2 down. So, moving right twice would get to neutral, then right again to 3, 4, 5, 6. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various directions. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving right 5 steps would get to 4 right, which is a wall. So that's blocked. Therefore, I need to find another path.

Maybe using the ball to create a tunnel. If I push the ball down from its position (6 right, 2 up) to 6 right, 1 up, then perhaps that opens a path. Let's see. If I can move the ball down, then I can move down from there to the key. But how to get to the ball's position.

Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. To reach the ball's position (6 right, 2 up), I need to move right 7 steps and up 2 steps. But there are walls at 4 right in various positions. For example, at 4 right and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, etc. So moving right past 4 right would hit a wall. Therefore, that path is blocked.

Alternative idea: Maybe rearrange the rules. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If I can change the rule 'key is win' to something else, but there's no 'win' rule anymore? Wait, in the latest observation, active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So 'win' is defined by 'key is win'. If I can move the 'win' text block to associate with Baba, then I could become the win condition. But how?

The 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 3 step up. To move that, I need to move the 'win' text block. But can I? The text blocks can be moved if they aren't defined as stop. The active rules say wall is stop, so any object named 'wall' is stop. But 'is', 'you', 'win', etc., are not stop. So maybe I can pick up the 'win' text block and move it.

But how to do that. Since I'm Baba (you), I can move around. The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 3 up. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up 5 steps and right 10 steps would reach the 'win' rule. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 right, 3 up is a wall. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe first move the 'key is win' rule to make Baba the win. If I can move the 'win' text block to be 'baba is win', that would make Baba the win condition. But the 'win' rule is currently 'key is win'. To change that, I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'is' rule is at 3 step up (from the initial position). The 'baba' rule is at 1 left and 2 down. So, if I can move the 'win' text block to be adjacent to 'baba' and 'is', then the rule would become 'baba is win'.

But to move the 'win' text block, which is at 9 right, 3 up, I need to navigate there. From Baba's position, moving right and up, but there are walls. Maybe use the ball to create a path? Or find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe push the ball to block a wall, creating a path. Let's think.

The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. If I move the ball down to 6 right, 1 up, then maybe that opens a path. Then move down to the key.

But how to move the ball. First, I need to get to the ball's position. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving right 7 steps and up 2 steps would get there, but there's a wall at 4 right. So that's not possible.

Alternative approach: Maybe the key is now the win condition, so touching the key wins. So the goal is to reach the key at 6 right, 1 down. But how to get there avoiding walls.

Baba's position is 1 left, 2 down. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. So the direct path is right 7 steps and down 1 step. But there's a wall at 4 right. So moving right past 4 right would hit the wall. So that's blocked.

Maybe go around the wall. For example, move up to avoid the wall. From Baba's position, move up once to 1 left, 1 down. Then right 4 steps (to 3 right), but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 down. So can't go further right. Then move down to original position. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move up more. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), move up 3 steps to 1 left, -1 down. Then right 4 steps (to 3 right), but again a wall at 4 right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the ball can be used to push a wall. The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. If I can move the ball to block the wall at 4 right, but I don't see how that helps.

Another idea: The 'key is win' rule means that grabbing the key makes you win. So maybe the key is interactable. In Baba Is You, touching an object that's the win condition wins. So if I can reach the key, touching it would win. But the path is blocked by walls.

So perhaps I need to move the walls out of the way. Since walls are stop, but how to move them. Unless there's a way to change their property. For example, if I can change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is you', then walls become passable. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks.

The 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. To change 'wall' to 'you', I need to move the 'stop' text block next to 'wall' and 'you' instead. But 'you' is currently at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So the current 'you' rule is 'baba is you'.

So, to create a new rule 'wall is you', I need to have the 'wall' text block next to 'is' and 'you'. The 'is' rule is at 3 step up. The 'you' rule is at 1 right and 2 down. So if I can move the 'stop' block from the 'wall is stop' rule to be next to 'wall' and 'you', then it would become 'wall is you', making walls passable.

But how to do that. The 'stop' rule is at 1 right and 3 up. The 'wall' is at 1 left and 3 up. The 'is' is at 3 step up. The 'you' is at 1 right and 2 down.

This seems complicated. Maybe it's faster to try to push the ball to create a path. Let's see.

The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. If I can move the ball down to 6 right, 1 up, then maybe I can move down from there to the key. But how to reach the ball's position.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can move down from the ball's position (6 right, 2 up) to 6 right, 1 up, then right to 6 right, 1 down. But there's a key there. So maybe moving down from the ball's position to 6 right, 1 up, then right to 6 right, 1 down (the key). But how to get to the ball's position.

Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. To reach the ball's position (6 right, 2 up), need to move right 7 steps and up 2 steps. But there's a wall at 4 right. So that's blocked. Unless there's a way around.

Wait, maybe move up first. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), move up 2 steps to 1 left, 0 down. Then right 4 steps (to 3 right), but there's a wall at 4 right, 0 down. So can't go further. Then move down back.

This isn't working. Maybe another approach. Let's look at the objects again.

Rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right. So the 'ball is' rule is at 1 step to the right. Maybe that means the ball's property is defined by that rule. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used as a pushable object. Since ball isn't stop, I can move into it and push it. So if I'm next to the ball, I can move in a direction, pushing the ball.

The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. So the ball is to the right and above Baba. To push the ball down, I need to move down towards it. But how to get close.

Alternatively, move right towards the ball. But there's a wall at 4 right. So perhaps move up to avoid the wall. Let's try:

Baba's position: 1 left, 2 down.

Move up once: 1 left, 1 down.

Move right 4 times: would get to 3 right, 1 down. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 down. Can't move further right.

Move down to original position.

Not helpful.

Alternative path: Move up twice to 1 left, -1 down.

Move right 4 times: 3 right, -1 down. Wall at 4 right, -1 down.

No good.

Maybe this level requires rearranging the rules. Let's focus on that.

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you.

To win, either reach the key (key is win) or become the win condition by changing the rules.

If I can change 'key is win' to 'baba is win', then touching Baba would win. But how?

The 'win' rule is currently 'key is win', located at 9 steps right and 3 step up. To change it to 'baba is win', I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'is' rule is at 3 step up. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left and 2 down.

So the plan is: move the 'win' block from 9 right, 3 up to be adjacent to 'baba' and 'is'.

To do that, need to navigate the 'win' block to that area. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the ball to push the 'win' block. But the 'win' block is a rule, and I'm not sure if it's movable. The rules are text blocks that can be moved if they aren't stop. Since 'win' isn't defined as stop, maybe it can be moved.

So, the 'win' rule is at 9 right, 3 up. To move it to near 'baba' and 'is', which are at 1 left, 2 down and 3 step up.

This seems very complicated. Maybe another approach: change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is you', making walls passable. Then go around the wall to the key.

To do that, need to rearrange the 'wall is stop' rule. The rule is at 1 left and 3 up. The 'stop' property is there. To change it to 'you', need to move the 'stop' block next to 'wall' and 'you'.

The 'you' rule is at 1 right and 2 down. So, if I can move the 'stop' block from the 'wall is stop' rule to be next to 'wall' and 'you', then it becomes 'wall is you'.

But how to move the 'stop' block. It's at 1 right and 3 up. The 'wall' is at 1 left and 3 up. The 'is' is at 3 step up.

So, the current 'wall is stop' rule is formed by 'wall' at 1 left, 3 up; 'is' at 3 step up; 'stop' at 1 right, 3 up.

To change it to 'wall is you', need to have 'you' instead of 'stop'. So, move the 'stop' block to be next to 'you'.

The 'you' rule is at 1 right and 2 down. So, need to move the 'stop' block from 1 right, 3 up to be adjacent to 'you' at 1 right, 2 down.

To do that, move the 'stop' block down two steps and left zero steps. So, from 1 right, 3 up to 1 right, 1 down. But is that possible?

The 'stop' block is a text block; you can move it if it's not defined as stop. Since 'stop' is a property, not a subject, maybe it's movable. So, yes, you can pick up the 'stop' block and move it.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'stop' block's position: 1 right, 3 up.

But Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. To reach 1 right, 3 up, need to move right 2 steps and up 5 steps. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 4 right, various positions. So this path is blocked.

Alternative idea: Use the ball to create a path. If I can move the ball to block a wall, allowing passage.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to push the ball to the key's position. Let's try:

Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. The key is at 6 right, 1 down.

If I can move the ball down to 6 right, 1 up, then I can move down from there to the key. But how to reach the ball.

Alternatively, move right and up towards the ball, but there's a wall at 4 right. So maybe move up first to avoid the wall.

From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down):

Move up once to 1 left, 1 down.

Move right 4 times to 3 right, 1 down. Wall at 4 right, 1 down. Can't proceed.

Move down to original position.

Move up twice to 1 left, -1 down.

Move right 4 times to 3 right, -1 down. Wall at 4 right, -1 down.

No luck.

Another angle: The key is at 6 right, 1 down. If I can move down from the key's position to reach it, but there's a wall at 4 right, 1 down. So maybe push the wall aside? But walls are stop.

Alternatively, change the rule 'wall is stop' to 'wall is push' or something, but that's not possible unless I can rearrange the rules.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the 'key is win' rule to make Baba the win. Let's see:

The 'win' rule is currently 'key is win' at 9 right, 3 up. To make 'baba is win', need to move","

The wall positions are all to the right side, blocking paths. But there's a ball at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. Wait, the key is at 6 right and 1 down. Maybe the ball is in the way. Also, there's a rule ""ball is 1 step to the right"", which might mean the ball is defined as something else? Not sure.

I need to navigate from Baba's position. Let me check his location again. The rule `baba` is 1 step left and 2 steps down. So if I'm assuming Baba is at that position, moving right might get me closer to the key. But the walls are all to the right, so moving right directly might hit a wall. Alternatively, maybe I can move up or down.

Looking at the map layout:

- The key is at 6 right and 1 down. So from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), if I move right twice, that would get me to 0 left, 2 down. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. Let me parse the objects again.

There's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 step up, 2 step up, 1 step up, etc. So maybe the path is blocked on the right. The ball is at 6 steps right and 2 step up. The key is at 6 right and 1 down. So perhaps moving down from Baba's position (2 steps down) to 1 step down would get me closer. But there's a key there at 6 right and 1 down. Also, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move right from Baba's position, I can go right once (to 0 left, 2 down), then maybe down to 1 down, but the wall at 4 steps right might block that path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to avoid the walls. Let's see: from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up once would be 1 left, 1 down. Then maybe right? But there's a wall at 4 steps right in various positions. Hmm.

Wait, the rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right. So maybe the ball is an object that can be moved? If I can move the ball out of the way, but the key is the win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules. For example, if I can make the key a stop, then the door (if there was one) would be the win. But the active rules now have key is win, so touching the key wins.

Another approach: Since I'm Baba and I can move text blocks. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move that ""you"" rule elsewhere to change what I am. But I need to reach the key first.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to push blocks. But the problem statement says you can only move objects or text that are not defined as stop. Since wall is stop, but Baba is you, and you can move unless stopped. So maybe I can move past walls by not touching them. Wait, no—walls are stop, so if you move into a wall, you can't. So need to find a path around the walls.

Looking at the map again:

Baba's position is rule `baba` at 1 left, 2 down. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. The path to the right is blocked by walls at 4 steps right. So maybe go up first. From Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), moving up to 1 left, 1 down. Then right once to 0 left, 1 down. Then up again to 0 left, 0 down. But are there walls there? Let's check:

Looking at the objects:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right (at ground level)
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down

So the walls are all clustered around 4 steps right. So moving right from Baba's position (which is 1 left, 2 down) towards the right direction, after a couple steps, there's a wall at 4 steps right. So maybe the path is blocked there. But perhaps moving up past the walls.

Alternative route: Move up from Baba's position to 1 left, 1 down. Then right to 0 left, 1 down. Then up to 0 left, 0 down. Then right to 1 left, 0 down. But I'm not sure if that's clear of walls. The walls at 4 steps right are higher up, so maybe lower down is clear.

But the key is at 6 right and 1 down. So from 0 left, 0 down, moving right four steps would reach 4 right, but there's a wall there. So maybe that's not the way.

Wait, the key is at 6 right and 1 down. If I can move around the walls to the right, perhaps by going up then right. Let's see:

From Baba (1 left, 2 down):

- Move up to 1 left, 1 down.
- Move up again to 1 left, 0 down.
- Move up again to 1 left, -1 down (if possible).
- Then move right to 0 left, -1 down.
- Continue moving right towards the key.

But I need to check if there are walls in that path. Looking at the wall positions:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right (ground level)
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down

So above ground level (y >=0), the walls are at 4 steps right up to 3 step up. So maybe moving up from Baba's position (2 down) to -1 down (which is up) might be clear. Let's see:

If I move up three times from 2 down:

1. Up to 1 down
2. Up to 0 down
3. Up to -1 down

At -1 down, check if there's a wall. Looking at the objects, the walls are at 4 steps right and up to 3 step up (which would be -1 down if the coordinate system is different). Wait, maybe the coordinate system is such that up is positive y, so 3 step up is higher y. So moving up from 2 down (y=2) to y=3, 4, 5, etc. But the walls at 4 steps right and 3 step up are at (x=4, y=3). So if I move up to y=3, x=1 (since Baba is at 1 left, which is x=-1?), this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinate system is relative. Maybe the ""1 step to the left"" means x-1, and ""3 step up"" means y+3. So Baba's position is (x=-1, y=-2) if considering down as negative y. Then the key is at (x=5, y=-1). The walls are at x=4, various y positions.

So to get from (-1, -2) to (5, -1), need to move right and up. But the walls at x=4 block the path. Maybe go around by moving up first.

From (-1, -2):

1. Move up to (-1, -1)
2. Move up to (-1, 0)
3. Move right to (0, 0)
4. Move right to (1, 0)
5. Move right to (2, 0)
6. Move right to (3, 0)
7. Move right to (4, 0) – but there's a wall at x=4, y=0 (since wall 4 steps to the right is at x=4, y=ground level). So can't go there.

Alternative path:

From (-1, -2):

1. Move right to (0, -2)
2. Move right to (1, -2)
3. Move right to (2, -2)
4. Move right to (3, -2)
5. Move right to (4, -2) – wall here.

No good. Maybe move up more.

From (-1, -2):

1. Move up to (-1, -1)
2. Move right to (0, -1)
3. Move right to (1, -1)
4. Move right to (2, -1)
5. Move right to (3, -1)
6. Move right to (4, -1) – wall here.

Still blocked. Hmm.

Another approach: Use the ball. The ball is at (5, -2) (6 steps right and 2 step up from Baba's original position?). Wait, the ball is 6 steps to the right and 2 step up from where? The rule `ball` is 1 step to the right, so maybe the ball's position is at (2, 1) if Baba is at (1, 2) down. This is getting too confusing without a visual.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at (6, 1) down, so from Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), which is (-1, -2), moving right 5 steps and up 1 step would get to (4, -1), but there's a wall at (4, -1). So maybe push the ball out of the way?

But how? The ball is at (6, -2) (if 6 steps right from Baba's position). To move the ball, I need to be able to push it, but the game mechanics for pushing might require being adjacent and moving in a direction. However, since walls are stop, pushing might not be possible if the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe change the rule that defines the key as win. For example, if I can create a new rule like ""key is stop"" and ""door is win"", but there's no door in the current active rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the key is the win condition. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the door, but there's no door mentioned here. Wait, looking back, the initial observation had a door, but now after some steps, maybe it's gone? Let me check the latest observation.

In the latest observation, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The objects include a door at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So door is still present but not defined as win. So the key is win, door is just a door. So to win, I need to get the key.

But the key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is adjacent to a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So maybe I need to move the key? But the key is an object; can I move it? The problem says you can move objects or text that are not defined as stop. Key's property is win, which isn't stop, so I can move it. So if I can move the key to a different position, maybe next to me.

But how? The key is at 6 right, 1 down. To move it, I need to be adjacent and move it in a direction. Let's say I'm at Baba's position (1 left, 2 down), which is (-1, -2). The key is at (5, -1). To move the key right, I'd have to be adjacent to it. So I need to get closer.

From (-1, -2) to (5, -1), the path is blocked by walls at x=4. So perhaps move around the walls by going up.

From (-1, -2):

1. Move up to (-1, -1)
2. Move right to (0, -1)
3. Move right to (1, -1)
4. Move right to (2, -1)
5. Move right to (3, -1)
6. Move right to (4, -1) – wall here.
7. So can't go further right. Instead, move up again to (4, 0) – but there's a wall at (4, 0).

This is tricky. Maybe another approach: Use the ""ball"" rule. The rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right. So if I can move that rule next to the key, maybe change the key's property. For example, if I can make the key a stop, then it's blocked, but I need to win by touching the key. Alternatively, create a ""key is you"" rule, but that might not help.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule to the door. The door is at 4 right, 1 down. If I can move the ""win"" rule there, then touching the door would win. But how?

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 3 step up (from the observation). So the rule ""win"" is at (7, 3) if considering right as positive x and up as positive y. To move that rule to the door's position (4, 1), I would need to move the text blocks ""win"" and ""is"" and ""door"" somehow. But this requires being adjacent to those text blocks and moving them.

But this seems complicated. Maybe focus on moving the key first. Since the key is win, touching it wins. But accessing it is blocked by walls.

Wait, the ball is at 6 steps right and 2 step up. Maybe I can move the ball out of the way. The ball's rule is at 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule to the ball's position, perhaps define the ball as something else. For example, make the ball a stop, so it blocks movement. But I need to reach the key.

Alternatively, use the ball to push past the walls. But I'm not sure how the pushing mechanics work in Baba Is You. Maybe you can push an object if there's space behind it. The ball is at (5, 1) (assuming steps right and up), and there's a wall at (4, 1). If I can push the ball into the wall, but that might not help.

This is getting too complicated. Let's try to think of the simplest path. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. Baba is at 1 left, 2 down. The only way there is through the 4 right walls. Maybe the solution is to move up past the walls and then right.

From Baba's position:

1. Move up three times to get above the walls.
2. Move right past the walls at x=4.
3. Descend to the key's position.

Let's see:

Baba at (-1, -2):

1. Up to (-1, -1)
2. Up to (-1, 0)
3. Up to (-1, 1)
4. Up to (-1, 2)
5. Now at (-1, 2), move right to (0, 2)
6. Right to (1, 2)
7. Right to (2, 2)
8. Right to (3, 2)
9. Right to (4, 2) – but there's a wall at (4, 2) (from the wall 4 steps right and 2 step up).
10. Can't proceed. So this path is blocked.

Alternative route from (-1, 2):

1. Move right to (0, 2)
2. Move right to (1, 2)
3. Move right to (2, 2)
4. Move right to (3, 2)
5. Move down to (3, 1)
6. Move right to (4, 1) – wall here.
7. Move down to (4, 0) – wall here.
8. Move left to (3, 0)
9. Move down to (3, -1)
10. Move left to (2, -1)
11. Move left to (1, -1)
12. Move left to (0, -1)
13. Move left to (-1, -1)
14. Move down to (-1, -2) – back to start. Not helpful.

This is frustrating. Maybe there's a different approach. Since I'm Baba and I can move text blocks, perhaps I can change the rules to make the walls not stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I can walk through walls. But how?

The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The text blocks for these rules are located at specific positions. To change ""wall is stop"" to something else, I need to move the ""stop"" rule away or replace it.

For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to another object, like making ""key is stop"" and ""wall is ..."", but I need to have the ""is"" rule to create a new rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 3 step up and at 1 step down. So I can move these ""is"" blocks to create new rules.

Here's a plan:

1. Move the ""is"" block at 3 step up to be next to ""wall"" and ""not stop"", but I don't have a ""not stop"" block. Alternatively, create ""wall is push"" or similar.

Wait, the available text blocks are probably the ones present on the map. Let me check the objects again.

The objects include:

- rule `wall` positions
- rule `is` positions
- rule `stop` position
- rule `key` position
- rule `ball` position
- rule `baba` position
- rule `you` position

So the available words to create new rules are wall, is, stop, key, ball, baba, you,","

42,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, normally, I'm Baba, and I need to reach the key because it's defined as the win object. But maybe there's another way. Let me look at the objects on the map.

There's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. The ball is somewhere in the map. The key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 4 steps to the right in various positions, making a sort of barrier. The ball is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up, which might be movable if I can push it. But how?

Wait, the rules say that wall is stop, so if I try to move into a wall, I can't. But if I can change the rules, maybe I can move the wall or the ball. For example, if I can make the ball a STOP, then maybe I can use it to block something. Or perhaps make the key not a win anymore? But the goal is usually to reach the win object, which is now the key.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. That might be a text block that says ""BALL IS..."" Maybe if I can move that text block to create a new rule. For instance, if I can make ""BALL IS STOP"" or ""BALL IS YOU"", that could change things. But I need to move the rule `ball` text block.

The rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right. So if I'm currently at Baba's position, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, I need to figure out where I am. If I move right, I can get to the rule `ball`. But wait, can I move right past the walls? The walls are at 4 steps right in different positions. If I move right from my current position, maybe I can reach the rule `ball` block. Let's see:

My position is rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I move right once, I'm at the same level as the rule `is` at 2 steps down. Then maybe I can move up or right to get to the rule `ball` block. But the walls are at 4 steps right, so maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, perhaps moving down to reach the key directly, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball a STOP, then maybe I can push it into a wall or use it to block a path. But to do that, I need to move the `ball` text block next to the `is` text block so I can create a new rule. For example, moving `ball` next to `is` and then next to `stop` to make ""BALL IS STOP"". Then, the ball would act as a stop, possibly blocking my path or the key's path.

So the steps would be: move to the `ball` rule, then move it next to `is`, then next to `stop` to create the new rule. Then, maybe the key's position is no longer blocked, or the ball can be used to reach the key. Alternatively, if I make ""YOU IS BALL"", then the ball would be the you, and I could control it. But that depends on moving the blocks correctly.

Let me map out the positions. The rule `ball` is 1 step to the right. The current position of Baba is 1 step left and 2 steps down. So moving right once would bring me to the same horizontal position as the `is` rule at 2 steps down. From there, maybe move up to get to the `ball` rule. Wait, the `ball` rule is 1 step to the right, so if I'm at 1 step left and 2 steps down, moving right takes me to the same x-coordinate as the `is` rule at 2 steps down. Then, moving up one step would get me to the `ball` rule which is at 1 step to the right (so x=1, y=3 step up from where? Maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing. Let's assume that each ""step"" is relative to Baba's current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 6 steps to the right and 1 step down. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. So unless I can move the wall or destroy it, I can't get past. Since walls are stop, I can't push them unless they're not stop. Wait, but wall is stop, so I can't move through them. So maybe I need to reposition the wall by changing its rule. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can walk through it. But how?

The active rules are wall is stop. If I can change that rule, like making wall a you or something else, then the walls wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the `wall` rule text block. The `wall` rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So if I can move that text block, perhaps to say ""WALL IS YOU"" or another property.

But to move the `wall` rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's see where the `wall` rule is located. From the observation, it's 1 step to the left and 3 step up from Baba's position. So to get there, I need to move left once and up three times. But moving left from my current position (1 step left of something) would take me to the left. Then up three steps. But along the way, are there any obstacles? There's a wall at 4 steps right, but maybe not in that direction.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. The key is now the win object, so I need to get to it. The key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 4 steps right. So I need to move around that wall. If I can make the wall a stop, which it already is, so that doesn't help. Unless I can move the wall itself, but walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless the wall is defined as a different property that allows movement.

Wait, maybe I can use the ball to block the wall. If I make the ball a stop, then I can push it into the wall's position, but since walls are already stops, that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make the ball a win, then maybe the key becomes irrelevant. But the active rule says key is win, so changing that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe I can become the key by creating a ""BABA IS KEY"" rule. Then, since I'm Baba and the key is win, reaching the key would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the `key` rule text block. The `key` rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. That's quite far. From my current position, moving right multiple times would get me there, but there are walls in the way.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- I'm Baba, so ""baba is you"" means I control Baba.
- The goal is to reach the key, which is ""key is win"".
- There's a wall at 4 steps right blocking the path to the key.
- The ball is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up, with a rule `ball` at 1 step right.

Possible strategies:

1. Move the `ball` rule to create a new rule, like ""BALL IS STOP"" to block paths.
2. Move the `wall` rule to change its property, like ""WALL IS YOU"" to avoid it.
3. Create a rule that makes the key accessible despite the wall, like ""WALL IS NOTHING"".
4. Make myself the key by creating ""BABA IS KEY"".

Let's try the first strategy. To make ""BALL IS STOP"", I need to move the `ball` rule next to `is` and then next to `stop`.

The `ball` rule is 1 step to the right of Baba's current position. So moving right once gets me to the `is` rule at 2 steps down. From there, moving up to reach the `ball` rule. Wait, the `ball` rule is at 1 step to the right, which might be in the same horizontal line. Maybe the coordinates are such that moving right from Baba's position gets me to the `is` rule, then moving up gets me to the `ball` rule.

Alternatively, perhaps the `ball` rule is in a different direction. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual, but let's assume that moving right from Baba's position (1 step left and 2 steps down) brings me to the `is` rule at 2 steps down. Then, moving up one step would place me next to the `ball` rule, which is 1 step to the right. So the sequence would be:

- Move right (to `is` rule)
- Move up (to `ball` rule)
- Then, move the `ball` rule next to `is` and `stop` to create ""BALL IS STOP"".

Once that's done, the ball acts as a stop, possibly blocking the wall or creating a new path. Then, maybe I can path around the wall using the blocked ball.

Alternatively, after making ""BALL IS STOP"", move the ball into the wall's position to block it. But I can't push the ball unless it's not a stop. Wait, if the ball is now a stop, I can't move it. So that might not help.

Another approach: Move the `key` rule to change its property. The `key` rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. That's quite far. To get there, I'd need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. Unless I can move the wall first.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""WALL IS NOT STOP"". But to do that, I need to move the `stop` rule. The `stop` rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So moving to that position:

- From Baba's position, move right to reach the `stop` rule's position (1 step right and 3 step up). Then, move the `stop` rule next to `is` and `wall` to create ""WALL IS NOT STOP"". That way, walls are no longer stops, and I can walk through them.

But getting to the `stop` rule would require moving right and up. Let's see:

Baba's position: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.

To get to the `stop` rule at 1 step right and 3 step up:

- Move right once (now at the same position as `is` rule at 2 steps down)
- Move up three times to reach 3 step up (but need to check if path is clear)
- Along the way, at 1 step right and 1 step up, there's a wall. So moving up from the `is` position would hit the wall at 4 steps right? Wait, no. The walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. Maybe the path is blocked by the wall at 4 steps right and 2 step up. Hmm, this is getting too complicated without visual cues.

Maybe the best immediate action is to try to move towards the `ball` rule to manipulate it. So from Baba's current position (1 step left and 2 steps down), moving right once would take me to the `is` rule at 2 steps down. Then moving up to reach the `ball` rule. Let's try that.

So the actions would be:

1. right
2. up

But need to check if those moves are possible. Since walls are stop, but the `is` rule and `ball` rule are movable if they're not stop. Wait, the `is` rule's position is 3 step up, so maybe moving up from the `is` position gets me to the `ball` rule.

Alternatively, maybe after moving right to the `is` rule, moving up once gets to the `ball` rule. Then, move the `ball` rule next to `is` and `stop` to create the new rule.

But since each action is a single step, I need to sequence the moves correctly. Let's think step by step.

Current position: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down.

To reach the `ball` rule at 1 step to the right (assuming it's in the same horizontal line), I need to move right once. Then, from there, move up to reach the `ball` rule. Once I have the `ball` rule, I can move it next to `is` and `stop` to create ""BALL IS STOP"".

So the sequence would be:

- Move right (to `is` rule)
- Move up (to `ball` rule)
- Move right again (to position next to `is`)
- Move up (to position next to `stop`)
- Then, the `ball` rule is placed next to `is` and `stop`, creating the new rule.

But this requires multiple moves, and each step might be blocked by walls. Let's check the obstacles.

After moving right once from Baba's position, I'm at the same x as the `is` rule at 2 steps down. Then moving up one step would bring me to y=3 step up, which is where the `ball` rule is located (rule `ball` 1 step to the right). Wait, the `ball` rule's position is 1 step to the right, which might be in the same x-coordinate as the `is` rule. So moving up from the `is` rule's position (which is at 3 step up) would reach the `ball` rule.

Once I have the `ball` rule, moving it to the right next to the `is` rule (which is at 3 step up), then moving up to place it next to the `stop` rule (which is at 1 step right and 3 step up). Wait, the `stop` rule is at 1 step right and 3 step up. So if I have the `ball` rule, moving it right from its current position (which is 1 step to the right of Baba's original position, so x=1, y=3) to x=2, y=3 (next to `is` at x=1, y=3?), then moving up to x=2, y=4? Not sure about the coordinate system here.

This is quite challenging without knowing the exact map layout. Perhaps the best immediate action is to try to move right to get to the `ball` rule, as that seems actionable.

So the first action would be to move right.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the key or the door, but the active rules say that the key is the win condition now. So I need to get to the key. I'm Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"". The walls are stop, so I can't go through them.

Looking at the current observation, the key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down from my position. Wait, where am I exactly? There's a rule `baba` 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So my position is 2 steps left and 2 down from that rule. Let me map this out.

If the rule `baba` is at position (x, y), then I'm at (x-2, y-2). Let's assume the rule is on the grid. To move right towards the key, which is at 5 steps right and 1 down. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up, then more walls down. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. So from my position, I need to move right and down.

But first, check if I can move right. The immediate right is a wall at 3 steps right. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to move down first. Let's see. If I move down once, am I blocked? There's a wall 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So moving down from my position would take me to (x-2, y-3), which might be next to that wall. Wait, the wall is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. If I'm at (x-2, y-2), moving down once would be to (x-2, y-3), which is adjacent to the wall at (3, 2 down). So that's a stop, I can't move there.

Hmm, maybe I need to move left first? Wait, the rule `baba` is 2 steps left, so my position is 2 steps left from there. If I move left again, would that be possible? But there's no indication of a wall to the left beyond my current position. Maybe moving left is an option. Let me check the objects. Are there any stop properties to the left? The walls are all to the right and up. So moving left might be possible.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, so any object that's a wall can't be moved through. But I can move past them as long as they are not in my path. Wait, no—Baba is you, so you can move unless there's a wall blocking. So if there's a wall in the direction I'm trying to go, I can't move there.

So, from my current position (assuming rule `baba` is at some reference point), let's think about possible moves. The key is to the right and down, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position, maybe I can change what's win. But the current active rule is ""key is win"", so unless I can move that text block, the win condition remains the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba the win. If I can create a rule ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba would win. But how? To do that, I need to find the ""win"" text block and move it next to ""baba"" and ""is"". Let me check where the ""win"" rule is. In the current objects, there's a rule `win` at 8 steps to the right and 3 step up. So it's up high. To get there, I need to navigate past walls. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a ball object. There's a ball at 6 steps right and 2 step up, and a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right. If I can make the ball a win, but that might not help directly. Or maybe manipulate the ball's properties. 

Wait, the current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the key is the win. To get to the key, which is at 5 steps right and 1 step down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. So perhaps I need to move that wall out of the way. But walls are stop, so unless I can change their property. For example, if I can make wall not stop, then I could move through it. But how?

To change a rule, I need to move the ""stop"" property from wall to something else. The current rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can move the ""stop"" text block and attach it to another object, like ball becomes stop, then wall would no longer be stop. But how to do that?

Looking at the objects, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" text block to, say, ball, then ball would be stop, and wall would not be. But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be able to move text blocks that are not stop. Since I'm Baba (you), and wall is stop, can I move other text blocks?

Wait, the rules say that only objects not defined as stop can be moved. So, if an object is stop, you can't move it. But the ""stop"" property is attached to wall. So walls are stop, meaning I can't move them. But other text blocks, like ""is"", ""you"", ""win"", etc., are they stop? The active rules don't say so, so they can be moved.

So, the ""stop"" rule is a text block that says ""wall is stop"". To move the ""stop"" property, I need to either move the ""stop"" text block itself or rewrite the rule. For example, if I can take the ""stop"" text block and attach it to another object, like ball, making ""ball is stop"", then wall would no longer be stop. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block, which is located at 3 step up.

So, possible steps: move down to reach the ""stop"" rule, then move it to the ball. But how to navigate there? Let's see. My current position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. Let's assume the reference point is the rule `baba`. So moving down from there would be towards the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So moving down might not be possible directly.

Alternatively, maybe move left first. From my position, moving left would take me towards the ""is"" rule at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Then, perhaps move down further. But I need to check the path.

Alternatively, focus on moving the key. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. To get there, I need to pass through the walls. But since walls are stop, I can't. Unless I can change the wall's property. So the plan is: find the ""stop"" text block, move it to another object, making walls no longer stop, then navigate through the walls to the key.

So steps:

1. Move from current position to the ""stop"" rule at 3 step up.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" text block.
3. Move it to the ball, which is at 6 steps right and 2 step up, or somewhere else to attach it to ball, making ""ball is stop"".
4. Now walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
5. Navigate to the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Let's see the current objects. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. My position is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule. So moving up would be towards the ""stop"" rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the wall is at 3 steps right and 3 step up, which is above the ""stop"" rule. So moving up from my position, is there a path?

If I move up once, would that be possible? Let's see. My current position is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule. Moving up one step would be 2 steps left and 1 step down from ""baba"". Are there any walls there? The wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up is above the ""stop"" rule. So maybe moving up is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the movement is relative. The observations mention steps in directions relative to the player's position. So to move up, the player would have to adjust their direction accordingly.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the grid based on the observation.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at a certain position, let's note the key points:

- Active rules: wall is stop, key is win, baba is you.
- Objects:
  - rule `wall` at 2 left, 3 up.
  - rule `is` at 1 left, 3 up.
  - rule `stop` at 3 up.
  - wall at 4 right, 3 up.
  - rule `key` at 6 right, 3 up.
  - etc.

The key is at 6 right, 3 up. Wait, no, the rule `key` is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. The actual key object is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm, maybe the key is near the rule `key`.

The player's position is rule `baba` at 2 left, 2 down. So to move towards the key, which is to the right and down, but blocked by walls.

Perhaps the best approach is to move the ""win"" rule to be over the key, making the key the win even if it's not labeled. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba the win. For that, I need to create ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block adjacent to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""win"" rule is currently at 8 steps right and 3 up. That's quite far. To reach there, I need to move through a lot of walls. But since walls are stop, I can't. Unless I can remove the stop property from walls.

So back to the original idea: move the ""stop"" rule to another object, like ball, making ball stop, then walls are no longer stop. Then navigate through the walls.

Let's outline the steps:

1. From current position, move towards the ""stop"" rule at 3 step up.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" text block.
3. Move it to the ball, which is at 6 steps right and 2 step up. So place ""stop"" next to ""ball"" to make ""ball is stop"".
4. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
5. Navigate to the key at 5 right, 1 down.

But how to execute this movement? The actions are up, down, left, right, idle.

Assuming the player can move in directions, let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` is 2 left, 2 down. So to move towards the ""stop"" rule at 3 up, the player needs to move up three times? But there's a wall at 4 right, 3 up. Maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is in a different direction. This is getting a bit too vague without a visual, but based on the text descriptions, I need to logically deduce.

Another approach: Since the key is the win, and it's located at 5 right, 1 down, perhaps I can push the key towards me. But can I push objects? The rules don't mention pushing, only moving text blocks. So maybe not.

Alternatively, use the ball to help. There's a ball at 6 right, 2 up. If I can make the ball a tool to reach the key. But not sure.

Wait, the rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right. So maybe I can move that rule to make ball do something else. For example, make ball you, so I can control the ball. But I'm already you (baba is you). So if I make ball you, then both Baba and ball are you. Then maybe I can move the ball to the key. But the key is win, so if I reach it while being you, that would win. But the key is at 5 right, 1 down. The ball is at 6 right, 2 up. So maybe move the ball down and left to reach the key.

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" rule. The current ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. If I can move that ""you"" rule to the ball, making ""ball is you"", then both Baba and ball are you. Then I can move the ball towards the key.

So steps:

1. Move to the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 2 down.
2. Pick up the ""you"" rule and move it next to the ball at 6 right, 2 up.
3. Now ball is you, so I can control it.
4. Move the ball to the key at 5 right, 1 down.

This might work. But how to execute the moves?

The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 2 down. To reach the ""you"" rule at 1 right, 2 down, the player needs to move right once and down once. But wait, the player's position is relative to the rule `baba`. So moving right would take them towards the wall at 3 right. Hmm, this is complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the key, hoping that the path is clear. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, move down towards the key. From the current position, moving down would be towards the key's location. Let's see: the key is at 5 right, 1 down. If I move down once, maybe I can get closer. But there's a wall at 3 right and 2 down. So moving down would hit that wall.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to first move the ""stop"" rule off the wall, allowing movement through walls. To do that, the player needs to navigate to the ""stop"" rule, which is at 3 up. From the current position, moving up three times would reach there, but there's a wall blocking the path. Unless the player can move around the wall.

Wait, the wall at 4 right, 3 up is to the right of the ""stop"" rule. So if the player moves up, they would be next to the ""stop"" rule, but then they need to move right to reach the wall. But walls are stop, so they can't. This suggests that the player can't reach the ""stop"" rule directly because it's blocked by a wall.

Hmm, maybe there's another way. If the player can create a new rule that removes the stop property from walls. For example, create ""wall is not stop"" by moving the ""stop"" rule to another object. But again, to do that, the player needs to access the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, take the ""is"" rule and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". But where is the ""win"" rule? It's at 8 right, 3 up. That's far away.

This level seems to require rearranging the rules to make Baba the win or to remove the stop property from walls. Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action now is to move right towards the key, hoping that the path has been cleared, or to adjust the rules dynamically.

Wait, in the last observation, after some moves, the key's position might have changed. Let me check the latest observation:

Current Observation:
Active rules:
wall is stop
key is win
baba is you

Objects on the map:
rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 3 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
ball 5 steps to the right and 2 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `ball` 1 step to the right
wall 3 steps to the right
wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
key 5 steps to the right and 1 step down
rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `you` 2 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So the key is now at 5 right and 1 down, which is closer. The player's position is rule `baba` at 2 left and 2 down. So to move towards the key, the player needs to go right and down.

But there's a wall at 3 right and 2 down. So moving down from the player's position (which is 2 left, 2 down from the rule) would be towards the wall. Unless there's a way around.

Alternatively, move right twice: first to 1 left, then to the original position (0 left), then right to 1 right, etc. But each move must avoid walls.

Let me try to map the path:

Player starts at rule `baba` 2 left, 2 down.

Goal: key at 5 right, 1 down.

Possible path:

1. Move right twice: to 0 left, 2 down.
2. Move right again: 1 right, 2 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, which is two steps right from the original position. Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and current level is at various positions. Need to check if moving right is blocked.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 3 steps to the right and various positions (3 up, 2 up, 1 up, current level, etc.)

Assuming that moving right from the player's position (2 left, 2 down) would first take them to 1 left","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. My goal is to reach the key, which is now defined as win. Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. Hmm, maybe that's important. The key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout.

Starting from where Baba is (2 steps left and 2 steps down from some reference point?), I need to move right towards the key. However, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is stop. So I can't go straight right because that's a wall. But maybe I can move around it. 

The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ball or change the rules, perhaps I can create a path. Wait, the rule `ball` is 1 step to the right. If I can move that text block, maybe I can make ball a different property. For example, if I can turn ball into something that can be stepped on or remove its stop property.

Alternatively, since ""key is win,"" maybe grabbing the key is the goal. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's check the positions again:

- Wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Then another wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 step up. So between Baba and the key, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, which is a stop. So moving right directly isn't possible.

Wait, there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the ball's property. For example, moving the ""ball is [property]"" text block to make ball a stop or win. But the rule `ball` is located 1 step to the right. So if I move that rule to, say, make ball not a stop, I could walk over it.

But how do I move the text blocks? The rules specify that only objects not defined as STOP can be moved. Let's check which objects are STOP. The active rule is wall is stop, so any wall is stop. The ball isn't listed as stop, so maybe I can move the rule `ball` 1 step to the right.

If I move the ball's rule to somewhere else, like next to the key, maybe I can change its property. For example, making ball a PUSH or something else. But I need to see where the rule is located. The rule `ball` is 1 step to the right from where? Maybe from Baba's position. 

Assuming I'm next to the rule `ball`, I can move it. Let's say I move the rule `ball` down or right to create a new rule, like ""BALL IS PUSH"" or ""BALL IS YOU"". But the goal is to reach the key, which is win. Alternatively, maybe making the key a different property, but the rule is already ""key is win"".

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to reach it. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls at 3 steps right and 1 step up, 3 steps right and 2 step up, and 3 steps right and 3 step up. So maybe I need to move the walls somewhere else by moving their rules.

The rule `wall` is 2 steps to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule, I could change where walls are. But moving that rule would require it not to be a STOP. The wall rule itself is a text block, and since wall is stop, but the rule itself is a text block. Wait, the rule `wall` is a text block, and if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. But in the active rules, wall is stop, but the rule text blocks themselves—are they considered stop? Probably not, because they are rules, not the objects they define. So maybe I can move the rule `wall` to a different position to remove the wall.

For example, if the rule `wall` is at 2 left, 3 up, moving it to 2 left, 4 up would change where the walls are placed. But I need to see if that's possible. Alternatively, moving the rule `stop` which is at 3 step up. Moving that could remove the stop property from walls.

But this is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach key (which is win).
- Obstacles: Walls blocking the path.
- Available tools: Text blocks that can be moved to change rules.

Possible steps:

1. Move the rule `ball` to change its property. For example, make ball a push so I can push walls aside. But how?

2. Move the rule `stop` to remove the stop property from walls, allowing me to move through them. But where is the rule `stop` located? It's at 3 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe to a different position, it would change what is stop.

3. Alternatively, create a new rule that makes key reachable. For example, if I can move the rule `win` to be key, but it's already key is win.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the win condition is key. So I need to reach the key.

Looking at the key's position: 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down (stop). So between me and the key, there's a wall at 3 right, 1 down. How to get past it?

If I can move that wall, maybe by moving the rule that creates it. The rule `wall` is at 2 left and 3 up. If I move that rule, perhaps I can remove the wall at 3 right, 3 up, but that's not blocking me. Alternatively, the wall at 3 right, 1 step up is part of another wall rule?

This is tricky. Maybe I need to push a ball or use the ball to move a wall. But I don't see any push rules yet. Alternatively, if I can make the ball a stop, then pushing it could block my path, but that doesn't help.

Wait, the ball is at 5 steps right and 2 step up. There's a wall at 3 right, 2 step up. If I can move the ball to be under the wall, maybe I can create a path. But I need to see if I can move the ball. Since the rule `ball` is 1 step to the right, maybe I can move that rule to make the ball a different property.

For instance, if I move the rule `ball` down to where the key is, making ""key is ball"", then the key becomes a ball, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, make ""ball is you"", so I can control the ball. But then I'd have to move the ball to the key.

Alternatively, make ""ball is win"", but the key is already win. This is confusing.

Another approach: Since Baba is you, maybe I can use text blocks to become other objects. For example, if I can move the ""baba is you"" rule to make ""you is key"", then key would be you. But that requires moving the rule.

The rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 1 step down. The rule `is` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed by those. If I can move those text blocks to create a new rule like ""key is you"", then I could turn into the key and walk over the walls.

But moving those text blocks would require them not to be stop. Since the only stop is walls, and those text blocks aren't walls, I can move them.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the ""baba is you"" rule to create ""key is you"".
2. Then, as key, go to the key's position (which is itself), thus winning.

But how to move the text blocks? Let's see their positions:

- rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 1 step down.
- rule `is` is at 1 step left and 1 step down.
- rule `you` is at 1 step down.

So the ""baba is you"" rule is made by placing ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then ""you"". To move this rule, I need to pick up the ""baba"" text block and move it, then the ""is"", then the ""you"".

Alternatively, since the text blocks are separate, maybe I can move them one by one. For example, move the ""you"" rule to a new position to form ""key is you"".

If I can move the ""you"" rule from 1 step down to be next to ""key"" and ""is"", then the new rule would be ""key is you"", making the key controllable. Then, since I'm Baba (you), I can move into the key's position.

But the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So even if I become the key, I need to get past that wall. Maybe if I change the wall's rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall not a stop. The rule `stop` is at 3 step up. If I can move that rule, say, to 3 step down, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But moving the ""stop"" rule would require it not to be stop, which it is. Wait, the rule `stop` is a text block. The rule ""wall is stop"" makes walls stop, but the ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. Since walls are stop, but the ""stop"" rule isn't a wall, it can be moved.

So if I can move the ""stop"" rule, I can remove the stop property from walls. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule to say ""floor is stop"", but that's not helpful. Or moving it to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. But text blocks can't be deleted, only moved, which would change their position and thus the rule they create.

The ""stop"" rule is currently at 3 step up. If I move it to, say, next to the ""wall"" rule, then the new rule would be ""wall is [whatever is next to it]"". But I need to see where to move it.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move the key to a different position, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, use the ball to push a wall.

Wait, there's a ball at 5 steps right and 2 step up. If I can make the ball a push, then I could push a wall out of the way. But to make the ball a push, I need to create a new rule ""ball is push"". To do that, I need to move the existing ""ball"" rule and ""is"" rule together.

The existing ""ball"" rule is at 1 step to the right. So if I can move that rule down to where the key is, and combine it with an ""is"" and ""push"" rule, but I don't have a ""push"" rule. Maybe create a new rule by moving existing text blocks.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to form new properties. For example, take the ""is"" at 3 step up and combine it with ""ball"" and ""push"" (if I can move ""push"" somewhere). But I don't see a ""push"" rule in the active rules.

This level is quite challenging. Let me try to outline possible steps again:

1. Reach the key, which is win.
2. Path blocked by walls at 3 right, 1 down; 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 3 up.
3. Need to either move the walls, remove their stop property, or find a way around.

Option 1: Remove the stop property from walls by moving the ""stop"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move it to a different position, maybe next to a wall, changing the rule. For example, moving ""stop"" to be part of another rule like ""floor is stop"", but that doesn't help. Alternatively, moving it away so that the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer in effect. But text blocks can't be deleted, only moved. So if I move the ""stop"" rule far away, the ""wall is stop"" rule would still be active unless another rule overrides it.

Option 2: Change the key's position. But keys can't be moved normally unless there's a push rule.

Option 3: Use the ball to block or move a wall. If I can make the ball a stop, then pushing it into a wall might create a new wall, but that doesn't help. Or make the ball a push, then push a wall.

But to make the ball a push, I need to create ""ball is push"" rule. To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule and ""is"" rule next to ""push"". But there's no ""push"" rule in the current active rules. So I can't create that.

Option 4: Become the key by creating ""key is you"" rule.

To do this, I need to move the ""you"" rule to be next to ""key"" and ""is"". The current ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. The ""key"" is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. The ""is"" rules are scattered.

This seems possible. Let's see:

- The ""you"" rule is at 1 step down. If I can move it to be next to ""key"" and ""is"", then the new rule would be ""key is you"".

To move the ""you"" rule, I need to walk there. The current position of Baba is at 2 step left and 2 steps down (from previous observations). Let's assume that to move the ""you"" rule, I need to go to its location and pick it up.

But the path might be blocked. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move that wall by changing its rule, perhaps.

Alternatively, use the ball to push the wall. But without a push rule, it's difficult.

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule to remove the wall's stop property. Let's try that.

The ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. If I can move it to, say, 3 step down, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. So moving the ""stop"" rule down one step.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" rule's position is at 3 step up. Assuming Baba is at 2 step left and 2 steps down, moving up to reach the ""stop"" rule.

But the path to the ""stop"" rule is clear? From Baba's position, moving up three steps would get to the ""stop"" rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- etc.

So the ""stop"" rule is at 3 step up. To get there, Baba would need to move up from their current position. Let's say Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- rule `wall` is at (-2, 3)
- rule `is` at (-1, 3)
- rule `stop` at (0, 3)
- wall at (3, 3)
- etc.

So moving up from (0,0) to (0,3) would require passing through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). But are there walls in between?

Looking at the objects:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up: That would be (3,2)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up: (3,1)
- wall 3 steps to the right: (3,0)
- So from (0,0) to (0,3), the path is clear except for the walls at (3,y) for y=0,1,2,3. But Baba is at (0,0), so moving up wouldn't pass through those walls unless Baba is at x=3, which they're not. So moving up from (0,0) to (0,3) is possible, as the walls at (3, y) are to the right of Baba.

Therefore, BABY can move up three steps to reach the ""stop"" rule at (0,3). Once there, they can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, say, (0,4), removing the stop property from walls.

But how does moving the ""stop"" rule affect the game? The current rule is ""wall is stop"". If the ""stop"" rule is moved, say, next to a ""floor"" object, then the new rule would be ""floor is stop"", which isn't helpful. But if moved away, the original ""wall is stop"" rule would still be active unless overridden.

Wait, no. Each text block creates a rule. If the ""stop"" rule is moved, it's still present, but its position determines the rule. For example, if the ""stop"" rule is at (0,3), and there's a wall at (3,3), the rule ""wall is stop"" is created by the ""wall"" text block next to ""is"" next to ""stop"". If the ""stop"" rule is moved to (0,4), then the rule would be ""wall is [whatever is at (0,4)]"", which might not be anything, so the rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer exist unless another rule creates it.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe the best action is to move the ""stop"" rule down to remove the stop property from walls. Let's try that.

So the planned action is to move the ""stop"" rule from its current position (3 step up) to a new position, say, 1 step down. This would change the rule from ""wall is stop"" to whatever is adjacent to the moved ""stop"" rule. But without knowing the adjacent objects, it's risky.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" rule to create ""key is you"". To do that,","

45,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, Baba is the player character because of ""baba is you"". The goal is to get to the key, which is now set as the win condition instead of the door.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, no, let me check again. The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up? Wait, the observation says:

Objects on the map:
rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 3 step up
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up
...

So the key is located 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up from the current position. But where is Baba? The rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba's position is 2 left, 2 down from where?

Maybe the coordinate system is relative. Let's assume that the initial position is the reference point. So if the rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down, that would place Baba at (current x - 2, current y - 2). But without knowing the exact starting point, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the map is described relative to Baba's position.

Looking at the other objects: there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up. So moving up 3 steps would hit a wall. The key is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, so to get to the key at 6 right, 3 up, you might have to go around.

Wait, but the key is now the win condition. So the goal is to reach the key. But the key is behind a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. So how to get past that wall? The active rules are wall is stop, so you can't move through walls. Unless there's a way to change the rules.

Looking at the text blocks on the map: there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. Also, there's a ball object at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Maybe the ball can be used to push the wall? But the wall is 3 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can push the wall out of the way, maybe by using the ball. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the rule `ball` is a separate rule. Since the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The other rules like ball is... are probably not active unless moved. So if I can move the rule `ball` to create a new rule, like ""ball is stop"" or ""ball is push"", but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" text blocks to create new rules. For example, if there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right, and an `is` block nearby, maybe I can combine them to make ""ball is [something]"". But I need to move the `is` block next to the `ball` rule to form a new rule.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right.
- rule `is` is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, and also at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up, etc.

So to create a new rule, I need to move an `is` next to a subject. For example, if I can move the `is` at 1 step to the left and 3 step up next to the `ball` rule at 1 step to the right, then combining them would create ""ball is [property]"". But where is the `is` located relative to the `ball` rule?

The `ball` rule is 1 step to the right. The `is` rule is 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So their positions are not adjacent. Maybe I need to move the `is` block to be next to the `ball` rule.

Alternatively, there's another `is` at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up, which is near the key. Maybe moving that `is` next to the `key` rule to change its property. But the key is the win condition, so changing that might not be helpful.

Wait, the current active rules are key is win. So if I can make a new rule that says ""key is stop"", then the key would become a stop, but that's probably not helpful. Alternatively, making ""baba is win"" so that touching Baba counts as winning. But how?

Alternatively, since Baba is the player, if I can change the ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", then standing on Baba would make the player win. But how to do that? There's a rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that `baba` rule next to an `is` and a property, maybe I can create ""baba is win"".

But the properties available are stop, win, you, etc. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 8 steps to the right and 3 step up. So if I can move the `baba` rule next to the `win` rule and an `is` block, then combining them would make ""baba is win"".

So the steps could be:

1. Move towards the `is` block that's near the `baba` rule. The `is` block is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, in the current observation, the `is` block is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up, and another at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up, etc.

Wait, the `is` blocks are at:

- 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
- 1 step to the left and 1 step down (for the `you` rule)
- etc.

The `baba` rule is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So to get the `baba` rule next to an `is` and the `win` rule, maybe move down to the area where the `is` is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down, which is part of the ""you"" rule.

Wait, the rule `you` is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to map out the positions.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position defined by the `rule baba` object, which is 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from the reference point. The reference point is probably the top-left corner, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the map is described with relative positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. So if Baba is at (0,0), then the objects are positioned relative to that. For example, the `rule baba` is at (-2, -2), which would mean 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from Baba's position.

Then, the `is` block at 1 step to the left and 3 step up would be at (-3, 1) relative to Baba. The `win` rule is at 8 steps to the right and 3 step up, which would be (8, 1) relative to Baba.

The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up, which is (6, 1) relative to Baba. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up (3,1), so to get to the key, you need to go around the wall.

But how? The wall is a stop, so you can't push it. Unless there's a way to make the wall not a stop. But the active rule is wall is stop, so unless you change that rule.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right (so (1,0) relative to Baba). And a wall at (3,1). Maybe if you can create a rule that says ""ball is push"" or ""ball is stop"", you could use the ball to push the wall. But first, you need to create such a rule.

To create a new rule, you need to move an `is` block next to a subject and a property. For example, if you move the `is` block at (-3,1) (which is 1 step left and 3 up from Baba) next to the `ball` rule at (1,0), you could create a ""ball is [property]"" rule. But the properties available are stop, win, you, etc., which are located elsewhere.

The `win` rule is at (8,1), which is quite far. The `you` rule is at (1,-1) (1 step right and 1 step down from Baba). So maybe it's possible to move the `is` block near the `ball` rule and then combine it with a property.

Alternatively, maybe move the `is` block at (-3,1) (3 up, 1 left) to be next to the `ball` rule at (1,0). But those positions are quite far apart. Baba's current position is (0,0), `ball` is at (1,0), `is` is at (-3,1). To move the `is` block to (1,0), you'd have to move it right 4 steps and up 1 step. But can Baba move freely?

Baba's movement is subject to the wall is stop rule. So walls are at certain positions. For example, there's a wall at (3,1), which is 3 steps right and 1 step up from Baba. So moving right past that would be blocked. But maybe there's a path around.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to use the ball to push the wall. If the ball can be made to push, then moving the ball into the wall might move the wall. But to make the ball pushable, you need a rule like ""ball is push"". To create that rule, you need to move the `is` block next to the `ball` rule and the `push` property. But where is the `push` property?

The active rules don't include push, so it must be a text block somewhere. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at (1,0), but no `push` rule. So maybe there's a `push` text block elsewhere that's not listed? The observation doesn't mention it, so probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to change the ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"", so that standing on Baba makes you win. To do that, you need to move the `baba` rule next to an `is` and the `win` rule.

The `baba` rule is at (-2,-2) relative to Baba's position. The `win` rule is at (8,1). The `is` blocks are at (-3,1), (7,1), (1,-1), etc. So it's a long way, but perhaps possible by moving down and right.

But Baba is at (0,0), and the `baba` rule is at (-2,-2). To reach the `baba` rule, Baba would have to move left 2 and down 2. But are there walls in that direction? Looking at the objects:

There's a wall at (3,1) (right and up), but to the left and down, are there walls? The objects include:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up (which is (3,4) if Baba is at (0,0))
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up (3,3)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up (3,2)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up (3,1)
- wall 3 steps to the right (3,0)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down (3,-1)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down (3,-2)

So moving left from Baba's position (0,0), there are no walls mentioned. The walls are all to the right (3 steps right and varying up/down). So moving left should be possible.

So the plan could be:

1. Move left to reach the `baba` rule at (-2,-2).
2. Move the `baba` rule next to an `is` block and the `win` rule to create ""baba is win"".

But how to do that? Let's break it down.

First, move Baba to the position of the `baba` rule. The `baba` rule is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from Baba's current position. So actions would be left, left, down, down. But need to check if there are any walls in the way.

Looking at the map, moving left from (0,0) is clear. Moving down 2 steps would take Baba to (0,-2). Are there walls there? The walls are all at 3 steps right, so no. So moving left twice and down twice should reach the `baba` rule.

Once there, the `baba` rule is at (-2,-2). Then, need to move this rule next to an `is` block and the `win` rule. The nearest `is` block is at (-3,1) (1 step left and 3 up from Baba's original position), but that's quite far. Alternatively, there's an `is` block at (7,1) which is near the `win` rule.

Alternatively, maybe move the `is` block from (7,1) (which is 7 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's original position) to be next to the `baba` rule and the `win` rule.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, and it's located at (6,1) (6 steps right, 1 step up), but blocked by a wall at (3,1). If we can make the wall not a stop, then we can move through it. To do that, we need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-1,3) relative to Baba (since it's 1 step left and 3 steps up). So to reach that rule, Baba would need to move left 1 and up 3. But moving up 3 steps from (0,0) would take Baba to (0,3). Are there walls there? Yes, there's a wall at (3,3), but that's to the right. So moving up 3 steps should be possible unless there's a wall in the way.

Once at the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-1,3), if we can move it next to a different property, like ""stop is nothing"" or change it to another property. But there's no ""nothing"" rule. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is key"" or something else. But not sure.

Alternatively, move the ""wall is stop"" rule to be next to a different subject. For example, move it next to the ""ball"" rule to create ""ball is stop"". Then the ball would become a stop, but that might not help.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block that's with the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""is"" block is at (-1,3) (same position as the ""wall"" rule?), or is it separate? Looking at the objects:

rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up → (-2,4)
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 4 step up → (-1,4)
rule `stop` 4 step up → (0,4)
So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the ""wall"" rule at (-2,4), ""is"" at (-1,4), and ""stop"" at (0,4).

To change this rule, you need to move one of these components. For example, move the ""stop"" to a different position and replace it with another property.

Suppose we move the ""stop"" rule to be next to the ""key"" rule, creating ""key is stop"". But that would make the key a stop, which is bad.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" block to connect ""wall"" with a different property. For example, move the ""is"" block from (-1,4) to be next to the ""ball"" rule at (1,0), creating ""ball is stop"". Then the ball becomes a stop, which blocks movement. Not helpful.

This seems too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that the key is the win condition, and even though it's behind a wall, you can jump over it or use the ball to push the wall. But since the game doesn't have jumping, maybe you need to rearrange the rules.

Another Idea: Since the key is at (6,1) and there's a ball at (5,2), maybe use the ball to push the wall. But the wall is at (3,1). To push the wall, you need to be adjacent to it and push it. But the ball is at (5,2), which is diagonally north-east of the wall at (3,1). Maybe move the ball into the wall's position, but the wall is a stop, so you can't move through it.

Alternatively, if you can make the wall not a stop, then you can move through it. To do that, change the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, move the ""stop"" part to another rule.

But how? The ""wall is stop"" rule is three blocks: wall, is, stop. To change it, you need to replace ""stop"" with another property. Suppose you move the ""stop"" block to be part of another rule, like ""key is stop"", and then create a new rule ""wall is [something else]"".

For example:

1. Move the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to be next to the ""key"" rule, forming ""key is stop"".
2. Then, take the ""is"" block from the original ""wall is stop"" rule and pair it with a new property, say ""key"" (but key is","

I need to figure out what action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by understanding the current situation.

The active rules are: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, walls stop me, the key is the goal (since it's defined as win), and I'm Baba because of the ""baba is you"" rule. My goal is to reach the key.

Looking at the objects on the map, I'll parse their positions. The player (Baba) is at ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". Let me visualize this. If I'm at that position, I need to see where the key is. The key is located at ""key 5 steps to the right and 1 step down"". 

So, from my current position, to get to the key, I need to move right multiple times and maybe down. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, check if there are any walls blocking the path. The walls are positioned at various steps. For example, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but that's probably not in the way. The walls that could be in my path are the ones at ""wall 3 steps to the right"" and ""wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down"". 

Wait, my current position is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe the reference point is the rule blocks. Let me try to sketch a rough mental map. 

Assuming the ""rule `baba`"" block is the starting point, moving right 2 steps from there would get me to the position of the ""you"" rule. Then, down 2 steps would be where the key is located. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Hmm, so if I move right from my current position, I might hit that wall. 

Let me list the positions again to clarify:

- I am at: rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down.
- The key is at: key 5 steps to the right and 1 step down.

So, relative to my position, moving right 5 steps and down 1 step. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. That wall is part of the ""stop"" rule, so I can't pass through it. 

So, how can I get around the wall? Maybe by rearranging the rules. The level has text blocks that I can move. For example, there's a ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right"". If I can move that ball rule somewhere, maybe I can create a new rule that allows me to pass through the wall. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can change the ""stop"" property. If I can make ""wall"" not a stop, then I can go through it. To do that, I need to find the ""stop is wall"" rule and rearrange or remove it. Looking at the active rules: ""wall is stop"", so ""stop"" is defined as ""wall"". If I can change that, maybe. 

But how to move the text blocks. The objects list includes various rules and their positions. For instance, the ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 steps up. To move it, I would need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, but I have to make sure I'm not moving something that's defined as ""stop"". Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move unless there's a ""stop"" on me. 

Wait, the current rules are ""wall is stop"", so any wall is stopping. But I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", so unless there's a ""stop"" on me, I can move. Let me check if I'm on a stop object. My position is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the ""rule `baba`"" block. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at ""3 steps to the right and 2 steps down"". But my position is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the rule block, so maybe that wall isn't in my immediate path. 

Alternatively, maybe the walls are placed such that my path to the key is blocked by the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down. To get around that, I need to either move the wall, change the ""stop"" rule, or find another way. 

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right"". If I can move that rule next to the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can rewrite the rules. For example, if I can make ""stop is ball"" instead of ""wall"", then the wall wouldn't be stopping. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule and the ""ball"" rule together to form ""ball is stop"" or something like that. 

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes Baba immune to stops. Like ""baba is not stop"". But to do that, I need to find the ""stop"" rule and rearrange it. 

Another approach: since the key is now the win condition (due to ""key is win""), maybe I can reach the key by moving right past the wall. But the wall is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, and the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. So between me and the key, there's a wall at 3 steps right, 1 step down. If I could move past that, but it's a stop. 

Wait, maybe I can push the wall. But in Baba Is You, typically you can't push objects unless there's a rule allowing it, like ""push is you"". Since I don't see such a rule here, I can't push. 

So, the main options are either to rearrange the rules to remove the stop property from walls or find a way to bypass the wall using other rules. 

Looking at the text blocks, there's a ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right"". If I can move that ball rule near the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""ball is stop"", which would make the ball a stop instead of the wall. Then, the wall wouldn't be a stop anymore. 

But how to do that. Let's see the positions:

- ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up.
- ""rule `ball`"" is at 1 step to the right.

If I move the ""rule `ball`"" down to the same level as the ""rule `stop`"", maybe I can place them adjacent and form ""ball is stop"". 

So, from my current position, I need to move right to reach the ""rule `ball`"". Let's check the path. 

My position: 2 left, 2 down from the rule `baba`. To get to the ""rule `ball`"" which is 1 step to the right, I need to move right once. But wait, the ""rule `ball`"" is at 1 step to the right from where? If the reference is the same as my position, moving right once would get me there. 

But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, but if I'm moving horizontally, maybe the walls are in different rows. Let me clarify the coordinates. 

Assuming that the map is a grid where each step is in a direction (up, down, left, right), and the rules and objects are placed relative to each other. 

The ""rule `wall`"" is at 2 step left and 3 step up from the reference point (probably the starting rule blocks). Similarly, other objects are positioned relative to that. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the immediate goal: reach the key at 5 right, 1 down. The obstacle is the wall at 3 right, 1 down. 

To remove the wall's stop property, I need to change the ""stop is wall"" rule. If I can make ""stop is ball"", then the wall would no longer be a stop. 

To do that, I need to move the ""rule `stop`"" and ""rule `ball`"" next to each other to form ""ball is stop"". 

So, first, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" block. Let's see where it is. The ""rule `ball`"" is at 1 step to the right. From my current position (2 left, 2 down), moving right once would get me to the position of the ""rule `ball`"". 

But wait, can I move that rule block? Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", and the rule blocks aren't marked as stop unless they're part of a stop rule. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up, which is not in my way. 

So, if I move right from my current position, I can reach the ""rule `ball`"" block. Then, from there, I need to move it down or somewhere to combine with the ""rule `stop`"" block. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""rule `stop`"" block. But it's at 3 step up, which is above me. To get there, I would need to move up, but there's a wall at 3 step up (rule `stop` is there, but it's a rule block, not a wall object). Wait, the wall objects are separate. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Move to the ""rule `ball`"" block at 1 step to the right.
2. Move this rule block to a position adjacent to the ""rule `stop`"" block (which is at 3 step up).
3. Once adjacent, rearrange them to form ""ball is stop"", changing the stop property.

But how to physically move the blocks. In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by pushing them with your character, but only if you're a ""push""able object. Since ""baba is you"", and unless there's a ""push"" rule, you can move freely unless blocked by STOP. 

Assuming I can move the rule blocks by stepping on them and moving in a direction, as long as I'm not stopped. 

So, starting from my position (2 left, 2 down), to get to the ""rule `ball`"" at 1 step right, I need to move right once. 

Is there a wall in the way? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step down, but that's further to the right. Moving right once would place me at 1 step right from my current position, which is where the ""rule `ball`"" is located. Since it's a rule block, and I'm not stopped, I can move there. 

Once I'm at the ""rule `ball`"", I need to move it. To move a rule block, I can push it by moving in the direction I want it to go, as long as there's space. So, if I move right again from the ""rule `ball`"" position, I can push it further right. But where to move it? 

The goal is to get ""rule `ball`"" next to ""rule `stop`"" so they form ""ball is stop"". The ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up. So, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" up to that position. 

But how? From the ""rule `ball`"" position (1 step right), to get to 3 step up, I need to move up 3 times. However, there's a wall at 3 steps up (rule `stop` is there, but it's a rule block, not a wall object). Wait, the wall objects are separate. For example, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So, moving up from the ""rule `ball`"" position, would I encounter any walls? 

Looking at the objects, the walls are at:

- 3 steps right and 3 step up
- 4 steps right and 3 step up
- 4 steps right and 2 step up
- etc.

So, if I move up from the ""rule `ball`"" (1 step right), I would pass through spaces that are not walls. The wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up is diagonal from my path. 

So, moving up from the ""rule `ball`"" position (1 right) to 3 step up would require moving up 3 times. Let's see:

- From 1 right, move up once: position 1 right, 1 up.
- Move up again: 1 right, 2 up.
- Move up again: 1 right, 3 up.

At 1 right and 3 up, is there a wall? Checking the objects, there's a ""rule `wall`"" at 2 left and 3 up, which is not in my path. The walls at 3 steps right are in a different column. So, I can move up to 3 step up at 1 right. 

Now, placing the ""rule `ball`"" at 1 right, 3 up, next to the ""rule `stop`"" which is at 3 step up (assuming the reference is the same starting point). Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is listed as 3 step up. If the starting point is the initial rule blocks, then moving up 3 steps from there would be where the ""rule `stop`"" is. 

So, if I move the ""rule `ball`"" to be adjacent to ""rule `stop`"", I can rearrange them. For example, if ""rule `stop`"" is at position X, and ""rule `ball`"" is moved next to it, I can push them together to form ""ball is stop"". 

Once that's done, the active rule would change from ""wall is stop"" to ""ball is stop"", meaning walls are no longer stops. Then, I can move through the wall blocking the key and reach the key. 

So, the steps would be:

1. Move right to reach the ""rule `ball`"".
2. Move up to position it near the ""rule `stop`"".
3. Rearrange the blocks to make ""ball is stop"".
4. Move past the wall to the key.

But how to execute this in the game. Each move is a single step. Let's break it down:

Current position: rule `baba` 2 left, 2 down.

To get to ""rule `ball`"" at 1 right:

- Move right once. Action: right.

Now at 1 right, 2 down.

Next, move up to reach 3 up:

- Move up three times: up, up, up.

Now at 1 right, 3 up, next to ""rule `stop`"" which is at 3 up.

But ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up from the starting point. If I'm at 1 right, 3 up, and the ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 up (same column?), then I can move right to be adjacent. 

Wait, the ""rule `stop`"" is listed as ""rule `stop` 3 step up"". So, from the starting point, moving up 3 steps lands me at the ""rule `stop`"". If I'm at 1 right, 3 up, I need to move right to 3 right to be adjacent to the ""rule `stop`"". 

So, from 1 right, 3 up, move right twice to get to 3 right, 3 up. 

But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So, I can't move there because it's a stop. 

Hmm, this is a problem. The wall at 3 right, 3 up is a stop, so I can't move into that space. Therefore, I can't place the ""rule `ball`"" adjacent to ""rule `stop`"" because there's a wall blocking the path. 

Alternative approach: Maybe move the ""rule `stop`"" block instead. 

The ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. 

From my current position (2 left, 2 down), moving up three times would get me to 3 up, but that's the position of the ""rule `stop`"". Wait, no. The ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up from the starting point. If I'm at 2 left, 2 down, moving up three times would place me at 2 left, 5 down? That doesn't seem right. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the initial rule blocks. 

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Maybe I should try a different approach. 

Another idea: Since the key is now the win condition, maybe I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is at 5 right, 1 down. There's a wall at 3 right, 1 down which is a stop. So I can't move past it. 

Wait, the key is at 5 right, 1 down. My current position is 2 left, 2 down. So, relative to the key, I'm 7 left and 1 up. That's a long way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different win condition. The active rules say ""key is win"", so reaching the key wins. But if I can change the win condition to Baba, then I could reach Baba (myself) which is at the ""rule `baba`"" position. But that's already where I am. 

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means that if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would win. But how? 

Alternatively, if I can make ""you is win"", then since I'm you (Baba), that would work. But the current rule is ""baba is you"", so maybe rearranging that. 

But this might be more complicated. Let's circle back to the original plan of changing ""stop is wall"" to ""ball is stop"". 

Even though there's a wall blocking the path to place the blocks adjacent, maybe there's another way. 

Looking at the objects again:

- ""rule `ball`"" is at 1 step to the right.
- ""rule `stop`"" is at 3 step up.

If I can move the ""rule `ball`"" up and right to be next to ""rule `stop`"". 

From ""rule `ball`"" at 1 right:

- Move up once to 1 right, 1 up.
- Move right once to 2 right, 1 up.
- Move up again to 2 right, 2 up.
- Move right again to 3 right, 2 up.
- Now, ""rule `ball`"" is at 3 right, 2 up. Is ""rule `stop`"" nearby? ""rule `stop`""","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I need to get to the key to win, right? The key is located at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But there are walls blocking the path. Also, there's a ball nearby. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map, Baba is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the current position. The key is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. But the path is blocked by walls. Wait, maybe I can move the rules to change what's stop or win. The rule ""key is win"" is there. If I can move that rule to make something else win, maybe I can reach another object. Alternatively, can I push the key by making it not a stop?

Wait, the walls are stop, so I can't move through them. But maybe I can move the rule 'stop' to change what's stop. Oh, there's a rule 'stop' at 3 steps up. If I move that rule away, maybe the walls aren't stop anymore. Then I could walk through them. But how do I move the rules? I need to find the 'is' blocks that connect the subjects and properties.

The current setup has ""wall is stop"" made by the rule `wall` 2 left 3 up connected to `is` 1 left 3 up connected to `stop` 3 up. To break this, I might need to move one of those blocks. But I can only move objects that aren't stop. So, if I can move the 'ball' rule or the 'you' rule, maybe. But the 'ball' rule is at 1 step right, and 'you' is at 2 steps down. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba into something else. Since baba is you, if I can change that to, say, ""BABA IS KEY"", then maybe I can pick up the key. Wait, but how? To create a new rule, I need to place 'baba', 'is', and the new property together. Let me see where the 'is' blocks are. There's an `is` at 1 step left 3 up, another at 7 steps right 3 up, and another at 2 steps down. 

If I move the 'baba' rule, which is at 2 left 1 down, along with an 'is' and a 'key' or 'win', maybe I can form a new rule. Suppose I move 'baba' to be next to 'is' and 'win'—then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition. That way, if I reach a wall or something, I could win by being adjacent to it. But how to move those blocks?

The problem is that I can only move objects that aren't 'stop'. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But the rules like 'wall', 'is', 'stop', 'key', 'win', 'ball', 'baba'—are those movable? The tips say you can move objects or text that are not defined as STOP or similar. So, the rules themselves (like 'wall', 'is', etc.) are probably movable unless they're part of a STOP rule. The current STOP rule is 'wall is stop', so the 'wall' text is stop, but the 'is' and 'stop' texts are not stop. Wait, no—the 'wall' object is stop because of the rule. But the rule 'wall' is a text block that can be moved. 

So, perhaps I can pick up the 'baba' rule and rearrange it. Let me look at the positions again. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down, and 'you' is at 1 step down. If I move 'baba' next to 'is' and 'key', I can create ""baba is key"", making me a key. Then, if I move onto the key, since I'm a key, key is win, so that would work. Alternatively, make ""baba is win"" so touching the door wins.

But how to do that movement? Let me visualize the map. The key is at 6 right, 3 up. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. The 'is' is at 1 left, 1 down. The 'you' is at 1 down. The 'key' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. So, to create ""baba is win"", I need to move 'baba' next to 'is' and 'win'. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 3 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is door"" if there's a door nearby, but in the current observation, the door is defined as win, not present as an object. Wait, the active rules have door is win, but in the objects on the map, I don't see a door object. The key is the win object.

Alternatively, maybe push the key by making it not a stop. The walls are stop, but the key is win. If I can remove the 'stop' rule from the wall, then I can walk through it. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps up. If I can move that somewhere else, then the wall won't be stop anymore. But how? The 'stop' rule is connected via 'is' to 'wall'. So, if I can break that connection.

Wait, the rule 'wall is stop' is formed by the 'wall' text block at 2 left 3 up, connected to 'is' at 1 left 3 up, connected to 'stop' at 3 up. To break this, I need to move one of these three blocks. The 'is' block is not stop, so I can move it. If I move the 'is' block away, then the 'wall is stop' rule is broken. Then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. So, if I can move the 'is' block from 1 left 3 up to another position, that might work.

But where to move it? The goal is to get to the key. If I can remove the 'stop' from the wall, then I can walk through the wall to reach the key. Let's see the path. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up to the wall at 3 right 3 up is blocked. If I can remove the 'stop' rule, then I can go through. So, moving the 'is' block that's part of 'wall is stop' would break that rule.

To move the 'is' block at 1 left 3 up, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. But where can I move it? The surrounding area has walls. Maybe move it to the right, towards the key area. If I move the 'is' block to connect 'wall' to something else, like 'key' instead of 'stop', then 'wall is key' would be a new rule, making walls keys, but that might not help. Alternatively, move it to create a 'baba is stop' rule, but that's bad.

Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule itself. The 'stop' rule is at 3 steps up. If I can move that to another position, say next to 'baba' and 'is', then creating a new rule like 'baba is stop', but that would make me stop, which is bad. Not helpful.

Another approach: Since the key is win, and I'm Baba who is you, maybe I can push the key by making it not a stop. But the key is at 6 right 3 up, and there's a wall at 4 right 3 up. So between me and the key, there's a wall at 3 right 3 up. If I can remove the stop rule from that wall, I can walk through. So again, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.

So the plan is: move the 'is' block that's part of 'wall is stop' to break that rule. Then, the wall is no longer stop, and I can walk through it to reach the key.

But how to move the 'is' block. The 'is' block is at 1 left 3 up. Current Baba position is 2 left 1 down. So, to get to the 'is' block, I need to move up and right. Let's see the path. From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down), moving up one step would be to 2 left 1 down. Then right to 1 left 1 down (which is the 'you' rule), then up to 1 left 0 down? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is a bit different. The observations mention steps left/right and up/down. So each step moves one grid cell.

The 'is' block is at 1 step left and 3 steps up from the current position? Wait, the observation says the 'is' block is 1 step to the left and 3 steps up from where? Maybe from Baba's position. Wait, the objects are listed with their positions relative to something. The initial description says ""Objects on the map: rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"", etc. So each object's position is relative to perhaps the player's position or a reference point. This can be a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the map is a grid, and each object has absolute coordinates. But without a visual, it's hard to tell. Let's assume that the player (Baba) is at a certain position, and the other objects are located relative to that. For example, the 'wall' rule is 2 steps left and 4 steps up from the player. The 'is' rule is 1 step left and 4 steps up, and so on.

In that case, to reach the 'is' block that's part of the 'wall is stop' rule, which is at 1 step left and 3 steps up, the player needs to move up and left. But the player is currently at, say, position (0,0). The 'is' block is at (-1, 3). The player needs to move from (0,0) to (-1,3), which would require moving left three times and up three times, but there might be obstacles.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the 'is' block by being adjacent to it and then pushing it. Since the 'is' block isn't stop, the player (Baba is you) can move it. So, the steps would be: move towards the 'is' block at 1 left 3 up, pick it up, and move it to a new position to break the 'wall is stop' rule.

But how to navigate there. Let's think step by step. The player's current position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So if the reference point is, say, the top-left corner, then moving right would decrease the left steps. This is getting a bit complicated without a visual map.

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up. To get there, the player needs to go right and up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. If we can remove the 'stop' property from that wall, then the path is clear.

To remove 'stop' from the wall, we need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. This rule is composed of the 'wall' text block at 2 left 3 up, connected via 'is' at 1 left 3 up, connected to 'stop' at 3 up. So, if we can move the 'is' block away, the rule is broken.

The 'is' block is at 1 left 3 up. The player is at 2 left 1 down. To reach the 'is' block, the player needs to move left and up. Let's see:

1. From current position (2 left, 1 down), move up once to (2 left, 0 down).
2. Move left once to (3 left, 0 down).
3. Move up three times to (3 left, 3 down)? Not sure about the coordinate system.

This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe a better approach is to look for the 'is' block that's part of the 'wall is stop' rule and try to move it. Once moved, the wall won't be stop, allowing passage.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba a key or win. For example, if we can form ""baba is win"", then touching the key (which is win) would make us win. Or ""baba is key"", then picking up the key.

To create ""baba is win"", we need to place the 'baba' rule, 'is' rule, and 'win' rule adjacent to each other. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right 3 up. That's quite far. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, create ""baba is door"" if there's a door, but in the current active rules, door is win, but there's no door object on the map. So that's not helpful.

Another idea: The ball object is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a rule 'ball' at 1 step right. Maybe if we make 'ball' win, then touching the ball would make us win. But the active rule is key is win. To change that, we need to move the 'key is win' rule and create 'ball is win' instead.

The 'key is win' rule is made by 'rule `key` 6 right 3 up', 'is' 7 right 3 up', 'win' 8 right 3 up. If we can move the 'key' or 'win' block, we can change the win condition. For example, move the 'win' block to be next to 'ball' instead of 'key'. That would make 'ball is win'.

But moving the 'win' block from 8 right 3 up to near the ball (6 right 2 up) would require a lot of steps. Maybe not practical.

Alternatively, since the key is at 6 right 3 up, and the 'key' rule is at 7 right 3 up (connected via 'is'), maybe moving the 'key' rule next to the ball and 'is' to make 'ball is key', then since I'm a key, touching the ball would make me win. But this is getting complicated.

Back to the original problem: The assistant kept failing to provide a valid action. The last correct action was 'right' which might have moved towards the key. But after that, the observations changed, and now the key is at 6 right 3 up, but the player's position might have moved.

Given the latest observation, the active rules are still wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The key is at 6 right 3 up. The player (Baba) is at 2 left 2 down. The walls are at 3 right 3 up (blocking the path). 

The immediate action needed is to either move the 'is' block to break the wall's stop rule or find a way to pass through the wall. Since moving the 'is' block requires navigating to its position, which might be difficult, maybe a quicker way is to move right towards the key, hoping that the path clears or that the wall isn't actually there anymore.

But in the previous step, moving right might have got closer to the key. Alternatively, move up to get around the wall. If the wall is at 3 right 3 up, moving up from the player's position (2 left 2 down) would be towards the wall. If the wall is stop, the player can't move through it. So, perhaps the only way is to remove the stop rule.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the best action now is to move right repeatedly to approach the key, assuming that the wall's stop rule has been removed somehow, or that there's a different path.

Let's see. The goal is to get to the key, which is the win condition here. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall. The key is to the right, but there are walls blocking the path. I need to figure out how to move past those walls by possibly rearranging the rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move that ball somewhere. But wait, how do I move text blocks? I think I can move them if they're not defined as stop. The current active rules say wall is stop, so walls can't be moved. But other objects like the ball's rule might be movable.

If I can move the `ball` rule, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I make ""ball is stop"", then any ball would become a stop, blocking the path. But that might not help. Alternatively, if I can change ""key is win"" to something else, but I need to get the key first. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move the wall rule, maybe I can remove the wall. The wall's rule is at 3 steps left and 3 step up. So, to move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since I'm currently at the position of rule `baba` which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down, maybe I can move down to get closer to the wall rule.

Alternatively, the ball's rule is at 1 step to the right. If I move that rule to somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""ball is you"" so that I become a ball. But then, if I'm a ball, and walls are stop, I can't move through walls. That might not help.

Wait, another idea: the key is the win condition. So, if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are at 2 steps right and 3 step up, 2 steps right and 2 step up, etc. Maybe I can move the wall rules away. The wall rules are at 3 steps left and 3 step up (rule `wall`), and there's another wall at 1 step left and 3 step up (rule `stop`). 

If I can move the `wall` rule, say to a different position, then the wall might no longer block. For example, if I move the `wall` rule from 3 left, 3 up to somewhere else, like next to the wall itself. Then the wall's property might change, or maybe it disappears. But how?

I need to get to the `wall` rule. The `wall` rule is 3 steps left and 3 steps up from my current position. My current position is rule `baba` at 3 left and 2 down. So to get to the `wall` rule, I need to move left 3 steps and up 3 steps. But that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 3 up. My current position is rule `baba` at 3 left and 2 down. So my actual position is probably at (0,0), but the rules and objects are positioned relative to me. So to reach the key, I need to move right and up. But the way is blocked by walls.

Another angle: maybe I can create a new rule that overrides the stop property. For example, if I can make ""you is not stop"", but I'm already you. Wait, the active rules have ""baba is you"", so I am you. The walls are stop, so as you, I can't move through walls. So I need to remove the stop property from walls or find a way around.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step right. If I can move that rule to say, next to a wall, and make it ""wall is not stop"", but I need to construct that rule. To create a new rule, I need to have ""is"" nearby. The `is` rule is at various positions. For example, there's an `is` rule at 1 step left and 3 step up, and another at 2 step left and 2 step down.

So, perhaps the plan is: move to the `is` rule, then move it next to the `wall` rule, and combine them to create a new rule like ""wall is not stop"". But how to do that step by step.

Alternatively, move the `ball` rule somewhere and combine it with `is` to make ""ball is stop"" or something else. But not sure.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can pick up the key by moving towards it. But the path is blocked. If I can make the walls non-stop, then I can pass through. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The original rule is at 3 left and 3 up. So I need to move that rule away. To move it, I have to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. My current position is rule `baba` at 3 left and 2 down. So the `wall` rule is 3 left and 3 up from me. That's quite far. Maybe I can move closer.

Wait, maybe I can move down to get to the key's area. Let's see. If I move down from my current position (3 left, 2 down), moving down would take me to 3 left, 3 down. But I need to get to the key at 5 right, 3 up. That's conflicting directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to the right, so I need to move right. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 up. If I can remove that wall's rule, then the path is clear. The wall's rule is at 3 left and 3 up. So moving that rule away.

But how to get there. Let's think about movements. My current position is where the `baba` rule is, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I move right twice, I can reach neutral position. Then up three times to get to the `wall` rule. But that's a lot of moves. Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut.

Alternatively, look for other movable objects. The `ball` rule is at 1 step right. If I move that rule to the position of the `wall` rule, maybe I can overwrite it. But I need to be adjacent to both the `ball` rule and the `wall` rule. Let's see. The `ball` rule is at 1 right. If I move right to get there, then move up to the `wall` rule's location. But the `wall` rule is at 3 left and 3 up. From the `ball` rule's position (1 right), moving left 2 steps and up 3 steps would get to the `wall` rule. Then place the `ball` rule there, replacing the `wall` rule. But would that change anything? If the `wall` rule is replaced with `ball` rule, then the wall's property would be defined by the `ball` rule, but how?

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is you"", which would make the walls something I can move through. To do that, I need to have ""wall is you"" as a rule. So I need to move the `is` rule next to the `wall` rule and combine them with ""you"".

Let's break it down:

1. Move to the `is` rule located at 1 step left and 3 step up.
2. Move the `is` rule next to the `wall` rule at 3 left and 3 up.
3. Combine them to create ""wall is you"".

But how to move the `is` rule. Starting from my position (3 left, 2 down):

To reach the `is` rule at 1 left and 3 up, I need to move left 2 steps and up 3 steps. That would take me to 1 left, 3 down. Wait, but the `is` rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So my current position is 3 left, 2 down. The difference is 2 left and 1 up. So moving left twice and up once gets me there.

Once I'm at the `is` rule, I can pick it up and move it. Then move it to the `wall` rule's position (3 left, 3 up). The distance from the `is` rule's position (1 left, 3 up) to the `wall` rule's position (3 left, 3 up) is 2 steps to the right. So move right twice with the `is` rule.

Then, place the `is` rule next to the `wall` rule. Now, the `is` rule is adjacent to the `wall` rule. Then, create a new rule by combining them with ""you"". The original `wall` rule is ""wall is stop"", but if we place ""is you"" next to it, it would become ""wall is you"", changing the rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then I can go to the key.

But this requires multiple steps and precise movement. Given that the previous attempts resulted in defaulting to idle, maybe the action needed is to start moving towards the `is` rule.

Alternatively, maybe a simpler approach is to move towards the key directly, hoping that the AI can find a way around. But given the walls, that's unlikely.

Another observation: there's a key at 5 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe if I can move down to reach the key's area. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the current objects:

- The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down.
- My position is rule `baba` at 3 left and 2 steps down.
- So to reach the key, I need to move right 8 steps and down 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different position relative to me. The observation says ""key 6 steps to the right and 1 step down"" in one of the previous states, but now it's at 5 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe the map is changing.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to move right towards the key, hoping that there's a way through or that a rule can be changed on the fly.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The goal is to get the key, which is set as ""win"", so moving towards it makes sense. First, check the current active rules: ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". That means I'm Baba, so if I touch a wall, I stop, which is bad. The key is where I need to go, and touching it should win the level since it's defined as win.

Looking at the objects on the map, I'm at the position of the rule `baba` which is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from that position. Let me map out the path. 

To the right from my current position, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but maybe that's part of the upper structure. The key is directly one step to the right and down a bit. Let me check if there are any obstacles in between. 

Looking at the objects: there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, then a ball at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Then a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the path is blocked by walls or other objects. Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the rule `baba` position. So from my current position (3 left, 2 down), moving right once gets me to 2 left, 2 down. Then maybe right again to 1 left, 2 down. But then there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up, but that's above. Wait, maybe the path down when moving right? Let me visualize the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move right to reach the key. Let's see: the key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down from the original position? Wait, the observation says the key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from the rule `baba` position. So if I'm at rule `baba` 3 left, 2 down, moving right once would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 left, 2 down. Then down once to 1 left, 3 down? But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. Hmm, maybe not. 

Wait, the key's position is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from the rule `baba`. So if rule `baba` is at (0,0) for simplicity, then key is at (4, -1). The walls are at various positions. Let me check the walls around that area. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, which is (2,1). Then a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down (2,-3). The key is at (4,-1). So moving right from (0,0) to (1,0), then (2,0), but there's a wall at (2,1) which is above, not blocking the path down. Then from (2,0), can I move right to (3,0), (4,0), then down to (4,-1)? But need to check if there are walls in between. 

Wait, the wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up is (2,3), which is higher up, not in the way. The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is (2,1). So moving from (2,0) right to (3,0) and (4,0) should be possible unless there's a wall there. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, but that's (2,-3), not in the path. The ball is at (4,1), which is above the key. So moving down from (4,1) to (4,-1) would reach the key. 

But how do I get to (4,1) first? From the current position (0,0), moving right four times would get to (4,0). But there's a wall at (2,1), which is above. Wait, maybe I need to move up first? Let's see. If I move up from (0,0) to (0,1), but is that possible? Are there any walls above? The wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up is (2,3), so not in the way. But moving up from (0,0) to (0,1) is possible if there's no wall there. Checking the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right, which is (1,0). So maybe moving up is clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the path is right, right, right, down. Let's see: from (0,0) to (1,0) (right), (2,0) (right), (3,0) (right), (4,0) (right), then down to (4,-1). But does (4,0) have a wall? Looking at the objects, the wall is at 2 steps right and 1 step up (2,1), and 2 steps right and 3 steps down (2,-3). So (4,0) should be clear. Then moving down to (4,-1) where the key is. 

But wait, the key is defined as 'win', so touching it should win. However, the active rules still have 'key is win', so that's correct. The problem might be that the path is blocked by other objects. Let me check again. 

Another thing: the ball is at (4,1), which is above the key. But the ball has a rule `ball is ...`? Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right, which is (1,0). So the ball's properties might be defined elsewhere. But since the active rules are 'wall is stop', 'key is win', and 'baba is you', the ball's properties aren't specified, so it's probably just an object that can be walked over unless there's a rule against it. 

So, the plan is to move right four times to reach (4,0), then down to (4,-1) to get the key. But need to make sure there are no walls in between. The only walls near that area are at (2,1) and (2,-3), which are not in the path. Therefore, moving right and down should work. 

The previous actions tried 'right' a few times, but maybe the agent needs to keep moving right until reaching the key's x-position, then move down. Since the last action was 'right' and the observation shows movement, perhaps continuing to move right is necessary. However, after moving right a few times, the next step would be down. 

But according to the last observation, after moving 'right', the agent's position is now 2 steps to the left and 3 steps up relative to the initial rule `baba`? Wait, the observation keeps changing based on movement. Maybe the agent is moving towards the key correctly. 

In the current observation, after moving right, the agent's position might be closer to the key. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the rule `baba`. So if the agent is now at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down (from previous moves), moving right again would get closer. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is right, right, down, right, down. But need to follow the current position. 

Given the latest observation, the agent is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, no, in the last observation before this, the agent's position was rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down after moving right. Now, in the current observation, it's 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe I need to recheck. 

Wait, the current observation shows rule `baba` at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if the agent wants to get to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step down from rule `baba`, the direction would be to the right and down. 

From 3 left, 2 down: moving right once would make it 2 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 left, 2 down. Then right again to 0 left (origin), 2 down. Then right to 1 right, 2 down. Then down to 1 right, 3 down. But the key is at 4 right, 1 down. So maybe the path is right, right, right, down, right, down. But that seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move right four times to reach the key's x-coordinate, then down once. But given the layout, perhaps there's a wall blocking that path. 

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up (2,1), which is above the key's area. The wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down (2,-3) is far below. So moving right from (3 left, 2 down) to (0 left, 2 down) should be possible. Then moving right to (1,2 down), (2,2 down), (3,2 down), (4,2 down). Then down to (4,3 down), but the key is at (4,-1). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the coordinates. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to look for the key's position relative to the agent and determine the direction. The key is to the right and down from the agent. So the agent should move right until aligned horizontally, then down. 

In the current observation, the agent is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. The key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from there. So from the agent's position, moving right three times would get to the same x-coordinate as the key (since 3 left +3 right = 0 left), then moving down once. 

But wait, the key is 4 steps to the right, meaning from the agent's position (3 left), moving right 4 steps would reach 1 right. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the directions. The description says ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"", which means the agent is 3 steps to the left and 2 down from the rule `baba` text block. But actually, in Baba Is You, the positions are relative. Maybe it's better to consider the agent's position as coordinates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct action is to keep moving right towards the key. The previous actions tried right, and the agent is progressing. So repeating 'right' might be necessary. 

But in the last observation, after moving right, the agent's position changed. Let's see: if the agent is at 3 left, 2 down, moving right once would take them to 2 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 left, 2 down. Then right to 0 left, 2 down. Then right to 1 right, 2 down. Then right to 2 right, 2 down. But the key is at 4 right and 1 down. So after moving right four times, the agent would be at 1 right, 2 down. Then need to move down to 1 right, 3 down, then right again to 2 right, 3 down, etc., but that's not efficient. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a rule that allows pushing objects, but the active rules don't mention that. The key is win, so touching it is the goal. The only obstacle is the walls, which are stop. So the path must avoid walls. 

Looking at the objects, after moving right several times, the agent might encounter a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, but that's above, not in the way. The wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down is below. So the path down from the agent's current position after moving right should be clear. 

Therefore, the next action should be 'right' to continue moving towards the key's x-coordinate. Once horizontally aligned, then move down. But based on the latest observation, the agent is still not aligned yet. So 'right' is the best action.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, my goal is to get to the key because it's defined as win. But how?

Looking at the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from my current position. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, the wall is a stop, so I can't move through it. So I need to find a way around.

Hmm, there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. If I can move that ball somewhere, maybe I can push it to break a wall or create a path. But the ball itself isn't a stop, right? Unless there's another rule making it stop. Let me check the active rules again. No, wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The ball's rule is just `rule `ball` 1 step to the right`, which I think means the ball's property is... Wait, the rules are formed as ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the `rule `ball` 1 step to the right` probably means that the ball's position is defined by that rule. But how does that affect it?

Wait, maybe the ball has a property. Oh, right! If there's a rule like ""ball is stop"", then it would be immovable. But in the current active rules, there's no such rule. The only stop is the wall. So the ball can be moved, right? Because it's not defined as stop. So maybe I can push the ball out of the way?

Looking at the map, there's a ball at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Wait, no, the ball is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up? Let me check the objects again. The ball is listed as ""ball 4 steps to the right and 2 step up"". Wait, no, the exact line is ""ball 4 steps to the right and 2 step up"". So the ball is two steps up from the bottom? Or is that relative to some position?

Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. The problem is, I don't know where Baba is located in this observation. The objects are listed with their positions relative to some reference point, probably Baba. So, for example, ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 3 step up"" would be three steps left and three up from Baba's current position.

So if I'm Baba, and I need to get to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step down, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, no. The wall is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Let me parse the objects again:

- rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- ball 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- rule `ball` 1 step to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- key 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize it. Assuming Baba is at the origin (0,0), then:

- The `rule `baba`` is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down, meaning Baba is at position (3, 2) from that rule's position. Wait, no. The rule `baba` is located at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from somewhere. Wait, the way the objects are listed is a bit unclear. Maybe all the positions are relative to Baba's current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the positions are relative to each other. For example, the first rule `wall` is 3 steps left and 3 up from the next rule `is`, which is 2 steps left and 3 up from the next rule `stop`, and so on. This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe all the positions are relative to Baba's position. Let's assume that. So Baba's position is the reference point. Then:

- The `rule `baba`` is located at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from Baba's position. Wait, that would mean Baba is located at (3, 2) relative to that rule's position. But this is getting too tangled.

Perhaps a better approach is to look for the key and see if there's a path to it. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. But between Baba and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So that's a stop, meaning I can't move through it. So I need to move around that wall.

Looking at the other objects, there's a ball at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can use the ball to break the wall? But how? If I push the ball into the wall, does that destroy the wall? In Baba Is You, sometimes pushing objects into walls can remove them if there's a ""ROCK IS PUSH"" rule or something. But here, the only active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. There's no rule about pushing or destroying walls. So maybe the ball can't be used to destroy the wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to be over the key, but the key is already defined as win. Wait, no, the rule ""key is win"" is active, so the key is win. So if I can reach the key, that's the win condition.

Another idea: since Baba is you, maybe I can change the rule to make the wall not a stop. For example, if I can create a ""wall is not stop"" rule. But to do that, I would need to move the text blocks. Let's see where the text blocks are.

Looking at the objects:

- There's a rule `wall` at 3 left, 3 up
- rule `is` at 2 left, 3 up
- rule `stop` at 1 left, 3 up
- wall at 2 right, 3 up
- rule `key` at 5 right, 3 up
- rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up
- rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up
- wall at 2 right, 2 up
- ball at 4 right, 2 up
- wall at 2 right, 1 up
- rule `ball` at 1 right
- wall at 2 right
- wall at 2 right, 1 down
- key at 4 right, 1 down
- rule `baba` at 3 left, 2 down
- rule `is` at 2 left, 2 down
- rule `you` at 1 left, 2 down
- wall at 2 right, 2 down
- wall at 2 right, 3 down

Assuming these positions are relative to Baba, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. But there's a wall at 2 right, 1 down. So to get to the key, I need to go around that wall. But how? If I move right from Baba's position, I might hit the wall at 2 right, 1 up. Wait, no. Let's think again.

If I'm at Baba's position (assuming that's the reference point), and there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, that's blocking the path straight down to the key. So I need to go around either left or right around that wall.

But moving right from Baba's position would take me towards the wall at 2 right, 3 up, then 2 right, 2 up, etc. Maybe there's a way to go around through other paths.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule. The rule `stop` is at 1 left, 3 up. If I can move that rule away, then the wall might no longer be a stop. But to move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and it's not defined as stop. The rule `stop` is part of the active rule ""wall is stop"". So the text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are grouped together. To move them, I need to move either the ""wall"" rule, the ""is"" rule, or the ""stop"" rule. But all of these are likely attached as a single unit because they form the rule ""wall is stop"". So if I can move any part of that rule, the entire rule would move.

For example, the ""wall"" rule is at 3 left, 3 up. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up. So they are consecutive to the left. If I can move the ""wall"" rule to the right, that would shift the entire ""wall is stop"" rule to the right, changing the definition. But can I move the ""wall"" rule?

The ""wall"" rule is a text block that says ""WALL IS..."". To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and it's not defined as stop. Since wall is stop, but the text block itself is a rule, which might not be considered a wall unless the rule is active. Wait, the active rule is ""wall is stop"", which means any object named wall has the stop property. But the text block that says ""WALL IS STOP"" is a separate object. So if the text block is not part of the wall object, then it might be movable.

Wait, in Baba Is You, text blocks can be moved unless they are part of an active rule that makes them stop. For example, if there's a rule ""ROCK IS STOP"", then rock objects are stop, but the text block ""ROCK IS STOP"" is a separate object and can be moved unless there's a rule preventing it.

In this case, the text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are separate objects. The ""wall"" text block is at 3 left, 3 up. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 up, and ""stop"" at 1 left, 3 up. These form the rule ""wall is stop"". To move any of these text blocks, they need to not be stopped by another rule. Since the current rules are ""wall is stop"", but the text blocks themselves are not walls; they are rules. So unless there's a rule that says ""RULE IS STOP"", which there isn't, the text blocks can be moved.

So, if I can move the ""stop"" text block, perhaps I can change the rule. For example, moving the ""stop"" to make the rule ""wall is something else"". But moving the text blocks requires being adjacent to them and they not being stopped.

Looking at the current setup, the ""stop"" text block is at 1 left, 3 up. To move it, I would need to be next to it. But Baba's position is at the reference point (probably where the ""rule `baba`"" is located). The ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 left, 2 down. So if Baba is at that position, then to reach the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 3 up, he would have to move up and left. But there might be walls blocking the way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to create a new rule that makes the wall not a stop. For example, if I can create ""wall is not stop"" by moving existing text blocks. But to do that, I would need ""wall"", ""is"", and ""not stop"" text blocks. But ""not stop"" isn't present here. The available text blocks are ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", ""key"", ""win"", ""ball"", etc.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the existing rules. For example, move the ""stop"" text block after ""wall is"", making it ""wall is stop stop""? That doesn't make sense. Or move ""is"" between ""wall"" and ""stop"" to make ""wall stop is"", which would be invalid.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is key"", but that would require having the ""key"" text block. But the key is an object, not a text block. Wait, no, the text blocks are separate. The ""key"" text block is at 5 right, 3 up. So if I can move that to create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""key"" text block next to ""wall"" and ""is"", creating ""wall is key"". Then wall would be key, and since key is win, then wall would be win. But that might be a way to reach the wall (which is a stop) but if it's also win, then stepping on it would win the game. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Alternatively, since the key is at 4 right, 1 down, and it's the win object, maybe I can push the ball into the key's position? But the ball is at 4 right, 2 up. To get the ball to 4 right, 1 down, I would have to move it down, but there's a wall at 2 right, 1 down. Unless I can move that wall by changing the rules.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the key (win) at 4 right, 1 down.
- Blocking: Wall at 2 right, 1 down (stop).
- Possible actions: Move text blocks to change rules.

Possible solution:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.
   - To do this, need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 3 up.
   - Current position of Baba is at the location of the ""rule `baba`"" text block, which is 3 left, 2 down.
   - So from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), to reach the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 3 up, need to move up and left.
   - Path: From 3 left, 2 down → move up to 3 left, 1 down → move left to 4 left, 1 down → move up to 4 left, 2 up → move left to 5 left, 2 up → but there's a wall at 1 left, 3 up? Not sure. This might be blocked by other walls.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position so that the wall is no longer a stop. For example, moving the entire rule to the right, changing it to ""wallx is stop"", but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, breaking the rule into parts.

Another idea: Use the ball to push the wall. If the ball can be moved into the wall's position, maybe it would destroy the wall. But in Baba Is You, pushing objects into walls doesn't automatically destroy them unless there's a specific rule like ""ROCK IS PUSH"" and ""WALL IS DEFEAT"". Since there's no such rule here, probably not.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the wall passable. For example, ""wall is you"", which would make the player (Baba) able to move through walls. But to create that rule, I need to move the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"" text blocks together.

The ""you"" text block is at 1 left, 2 down (from the ""rule `you`"" object). So if I can move the ""wall"" rule (at 3 left, 3 up), the ""is"" rule (2 left, 3 up), and the ""you"" rule (1 left, 2 down) into positions that form ""wall is you"".

But this seems complicated. Let's see:

- The current ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 3 left, 3 up; ""is"" at 2 left, 3 up; ""stop"" at 1 left, 3 up.
- To create ""wall is you"", I need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"". So move the ""stop"" text block away and bring the ""you"" text block into place.

But how? The ""you"" text block is at 1 left, 2 down. To move it up to the ""stop"" position (1 left, 3 up), I need to pathfind there, avoiding walls.

Baba's current position is at the ""rule `baba`"" text block, which is 3 left, 2 down. To get to the ""you"" text block at 1 left, 2 down, he needs to move left twice. Then from there, move up to 1 left, 3 up, which is where the ""stop"" text block is. But along the way, is there a path?

From 3 left, 2 down (Baba's position):

- Move left to 4 left, 2 down (but is there a wall there? The objects list shows walls at various positions, but I'm not sure about this exact spot.)
- If there's no wall, continue moving left to 5 left, 2 down, then up to 5 left, 3 up, then left to 4 left, 3 up, etc., until reaching 1 left, 3 up.

This is quite involved, and there might be walls blocking the path. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way.

Another angle: The key is at 4 right, 1 down. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be over the key, but the key is already defined as win. So that's redundant. Alternatively, make Baba a win by creating ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to move the relevant text blocks.

The ""baba"" text block is part of the ""rule `baba`"" object, which is at","

Let's try to figure out what's going on here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. I'm playing as Baba because of the ""baba is you"" rule. The goal is to get the key, which is marked as win. But I need to reach the key without hitting any walls.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up from where the rule `key` is located. Wait, maybe I need to check the positions more carefully. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up relative to some point. Hmm, the exact positions might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the object positions again.

The rule `key` is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The wall is directly above that key at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. So the key is behind a wall. I can't go straight right because there's a wall blocking the way at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. But the key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinates. Let me visualize the grid.

Baba's position is at rule `baba` which is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So if I'm standing there, moving right would take me towards the walls and the key. The rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right, which might be a movable object. Since walls are stop, but other objects like ball might be movable if they aren't defined as stop. 

The plan is to move towards the key, but there's a wall in the way. Maybe I need to move the ball or another object to create a path. But how? The key is a win object, so once I reach it, I win. But the wall is there. Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make the wall not stop. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall wouldn't be a stop anymore. 

Looking at the active rules: wall is stop. If I can move the ""stop"" text block that's attached to the wall, then the wall would no longer be stop. The rule `stop` is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, perhaps by grabbing it since it's not a stop property itself, then the wall's stop property would be removed. 

So the steps would be: move right past the ball (which is movable if it's not stop), then move up to the ""stop"" rule, pick it up, and move it somewhere else. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved away from the wall, the wall would no longer block movement. Then I can go around the wall to the key. 

But wait, the current active rules are wall is stop. The wall's position is 2 steps right and 3 steps up. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up. So the ""stop"" rule is not on the same tile as the wall. Maybe the ""stop"" rule applies to all walls? Or is it that each wall has its own ""stop"" property? In Baba Is You, typically, a rule like ""wall is stop"" makes all walls stop. So moving the ""stop"" rule would remove the stop property from all walls. 

If that's the case, then moving the ""stop"" rule away would allow me to pass through walls. So the correct approach is to move the ""stop"" rule. To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""stop"" rule is located. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step left and 3 steps up from Baba's current position. 

Baba's position is at rule `baba` which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So from there, moving left again would take me to the ""stop"" rule. But wait, the rule `is` is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's position. Let me try to map this out. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is 6 steps to the right and 3 steps up from the rule `key` position. This is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps I should focus on moving the ""stop"" rule first. Let's see: to get to the ""stop"" rule, which is 1 step left and 3 steps up from Baba's current position. So from Baba's position, moving left once, then up three times. But need to check if there are any walls in between. 

The wall is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I move left from Baba's position, I'm moving away from the wall. The path to the ""stop"" rule would be left, then up. Let's see: 

1. Current position: rule `baba` (3 left, 2 down)
2. Move left once to reach the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 3 up.
3. Then move up three steps to reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 3 up.

But wait, moving left from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down) would take him to 2 left, 2 down. Then moving up three times would get to 2 left, 5 up? That doesn't seem right. Maybe the coordinates are relative to some origin point. This is getting a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is located at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up from the rule `is` which is at 2 left, 3 up. This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let's think differently. 

The key is the win object, so the goal is to get to it. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up from the rule `key` position. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can remove the stop property from the wall, I can pass through. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up. So relative to Baba's position, which is 3 left and 2 down, moving left once and up three times would get to the ""stop"" rule. But I need to check if there's a path. 

From Baba's current position (3 left, 2 down), moving left once takes me to 2 left, 2 down. Then moving up three times: 2 left, 5 down? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the rule blocks. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is located to the left of the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left, 3 up. So the ""stop"" rule is 1 step left from there, which would be 1 left, 3 up. To get there from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), I need to move left twice (to 1 left, 2 down) and then up three times (to 1 left, 5 down). But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, which is probably blocking that path. 

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the best action is to move right towards the key, but there's a wall in the way. If I can push the wall, but walls are stop, so I can't. Alternatively, find a way to make the wall not stop. 

Since the active rule is ""wall is stop"", if I can change that rule, then the wall wouldn't be stop. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different subject, like making ""baba is stop"", then walls would still be stop, but Baba would be stop as well, which is bad. Alternatively, delete the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""is"" that connects them. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of the rule `wall` at 3 left, 3 up, the rule `is` at 2 left, 3 up, and the rule `stop` at 1 left, 3 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. 

If I can move the ""is"" that connects wall and stop, then the rule would be broken. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 up. So from Baba's position, moving left twice and up three times would reach the ""is"". Then moving it somewhere else. 

But getting there requires navigating through possible obstacles. Let's outline the path:

1. From Baba (3 left, 2 down), move left once to reach the ""is"" at 2 left, 3 up. Wait, no. The rule `is` is at 2 left, 3 up. So moving left once from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down) would take him to 2 left, 2 down. Then moving up three times would get to 2 left, 5 down? That doesn't align. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the initial position of the rules. 

This is getting too confusing. Let's try to think of the simplest possible move. The key is to the right, but blocked by a wall. The only way to proceed is to manipulate the rules. The most straightforward way is to move the ""stop"" rule away. So the action should be to move towards the ""stop"" rule. 

But how to reach it? Maybe move left and up. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left and 3 up. From Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), moving left once to 2 left, 2 down, then up three times to 2 left, 5 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are different. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is directly to the left of the ""is"" rule. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 up, so ""stop"" is 1 left from there. So to reach the ""stop"" rule, move left from ""is"". But Baba needs to get to the ""is"" first. 

This is really challenging without seeing the actual layout. Given the previous actions where moving right was failing, maybe the correct action now is to move left towards the ""is"" rule to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

Alternatively, the key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up from the rule `key` location. If I can move the rule `key` to be under Baba, then Baba would be win. But that might be more complex. 

Another approach: Since the key is win, if I can make Baba be win by changing the rules. For example, ""baba is win"". But how? The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. To make Baba win, I need to create a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to find the ""win"" text block and attach it to ""baba"". 

The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. So the ""win"" text block is located there. If I can move the ""win"" rule to Baba's position, then ""baba is win"" would be created. 

To move the ""win"" rule, I need to navigate there. From Baba's position, moving right multiple times. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, move the ""key is win"" rule. The ""key is win"" rule consists of the rule `key` at 5 right, 3 up, rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up, and rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""win"" from there to attach to Baba, but that's complicated. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed actions, maybe the immediate action should be to move right towards the key, hoping that the wall can be moved or the rule changed. However, previous attempts to move right resulted in failure, probably because of the wall. 

Alternatively, the correct action now is to move left towards the ""is"" rule that connects wall and stop, to break that rule. So the action should be left.

The goal is to reach the key which is labeled as 'win'. In Baba Is You, usually, the 'key is win' means that getting the key makes you win. But I need to check the active rules. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move, and walls are stoppers.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up, which might be blocking the path. Also, there's a rule 'ball' 2 steps to the right. Not sure how that affects things yet.

Wait, the rule for 'ball' is still 'ball is ...' but in the active rules, it's not listed. So maybe the 'rule ball' text block is separate. Since 'ball' isn't an active rule, maybe it's just an object. So if I can move past the walls, maybe by rearranging rules.

But how? The player is Baba, defined as 'you'. To get to the key, need to navigate around walls. The key is down near another wall. Let me check the map layout again.

The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but Baba is probably at the position of 'rule baba' which is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So moving down to reach the key area might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'key is win' rule to make something else the win condition. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then reaching Baba would win. But how to do that?

To move a rule, I need to touch the text block and the 'is' connecting them. The key is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, connected by 'is' at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. So if I can move the 'key is win' rule, maybe I can change it to 'baba is win'.

But to do that, I need to move the 'key' text block, the 'is' text block, and the 'win' text block together. Since the key is defined as win, and walls are stop, I have to navigate past the walls. The path might involve moving right to reach the rule blocks.

Looking at the current position of Baba: rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe Baba's position is at that rule's location. To get to the key's rule, which is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, I need to move right multiple times, then up.

But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, 2 steps up, etc. So moving up from Baba's position (which is 2 left and 2 down from the initial rule?) might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe moving right first.

Wait, the active rules show that 'wall is stop', so any wall is impassable unless the rule is changed. So I can't walk through walls. Need to find a path around them.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'ball' 2 steps to the right. Maybe that's a movable object. If I can move the 'ball' rule, perhaps I can use it to push other blocks, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is accessible if I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule. But how? To do that, I need to touch the 'wall is stop' rule and rearrange it. For example, making 'stop is wall' or something else. But that would require moving the 'wall' text block, the 'is' block, and the 'stop' block.

But moving those might be possible if the path is clear. Let's see. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. To get there, I need to move left from Baba's current position. But moving left might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe the key can be reached by rearranging the 'key is win' rule. If I can make 'baba is win', then touching Baba would win. To do that, I need to move the 'key', 'is', and 'win' blocks to form 'baba is win'.

But that requires navigating to where those rule blocks are. The 'key' rule is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up, 'is' at 7 steps right and 3 steps up, 'win' at 8 steps right and 3 steps up. So moving from Baba's position, which is at 'rule baba' 2 left and 2 down, I need to go right multiple times, then up.

But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. So the path right from Baba's position: first, move right to reach the rules. Let's see:

Baba's position: rule `baba` is 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe the origin is where the initial rules were. Assuming each step moves one unit in the direction specified.

To get to the 'key is win' rule, which is at 6 steps right and 3 steps up from some origin. So from Baba's position (which is 2 left and 2 down from origin), moving right 6 steps and up 3 would be the key's location. But along the way, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move around the wall by moving the rule blocks to change the 'stop' property. For example, if I can change 'wall is stop' to 'stop is push' or something, then walls wouldn't block movement. But that's a big change and requires rearranging multiple blocks.

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used. The 'rule ball' is 1 step to the right. If I can move the ball to push a wall, but walls are stop, so that might not work. Unless the ball has a different property.

Wait, the current active rules don't define 'ball', so it's just an object. So moving the ball might not affect anything unless a rule makes it do something. But since 'ball' isn't defined, maybe it's just a movable object.

So, perhaps the strategy is to move the 'key is win' rule to make 'baba is win', allowing touching Baba to win. To do that, need to move the 'key', 'is', and 'win' blocks to form 'baba is win'.

Let me think about the positions. The current 'key is win' rule is at:

rule `key` 6 steps right and 3 steps up

rule `is` 7 steps right and 3 steps up

rule `win` 8 steps right and 3 steps up

To make 'baba is win', need to move these blocks to connect 'baba' with 'win' via 'is'. The 'baba' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down from origin. So the new 'is' would need to be between 'baba' and 'win'.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'key' block to where 'baba' is.

2. Move the 'is' block to between 'baba' and 'win'.

3. Move the 'win' block to the correct position.

But this requires navigating through the map and moving past walls. Let's see if there's a path.

From Baba's current position (assuming at the 'baba' rule's location: 2 left and 2 down), to reach the 'key' rule at 6 right and 3 up:

First, move right 4 steps (from -2 to +2), then up 3 steps. But along the way, at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, there's a wall. So that path is blocked.

Alternative path: Maybe move down first to avoid walls. But the key is up, not down.

Alternatively, find another route. Maybe move right, then up, then right again, avoiding the wall.

Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. So if I go right 2 steps, then up, then right again, maybe? Let's see:

From Baba's position (2 left, 2 down):

Move right 2 steps → at 0 left, 2 down.

Then move up 1 step → 0 left, 1 down.

Then move right 1 step → 1 left, 1 down.

Then up 1 step → 1 left, 0 down.

Then right 1 step → 0 left, 0 down.

Then up 3 steps to reach the key's location. But along the way, check for walls.

At 3 steps right and 3 steps up from origin, there's a wall. But in this path, the movement is different. Let me map it step by step.

Baba starts at rule `baba` 2 step left and 2 step down. So in coordinates, maybe (0,0) is the origin, and each step is relative. So moving right increases the x-coordinate, up increases the y-coordinate.

So 'rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down' would be at position (-2, -2).

To get to 'rule `key` 6 steps right and 3 steps up' from origin, that's (6,3).

But Baba is at (-2,-2). So moving right 8 steps and up 5 steps. But along the way, there's a wall at (3,3). So when moving right from (-2,-2) to (3,-2), then up to (3,3), but that's blocked by the wall at (3,3).

So that path is blocked. Alternative route: Maybe go around the wall by moving up first, then right, then down, etc.

From (-2,-2):

Move up 5 steps to ( -2, 3 ). But along the way, at ( -2, 3 ), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up from origin, which is (3,3). So (-2,3) is clear.

Then move right 5 steps to (3,3), but that's the wall. So can't go there. So need to go around.

Alternatively, move right 1 step to (-1,-2), then up 4 steps to (-1,2), then right 2 steps to (1,2), then up 1 step to (1,3). But at (1,3), is there a wall? Not sure. The walls listed are at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc. So (1,3) might be clear.

Then from (1,3), move right to 6,3 which is the key's location. But along the way, need to check for walls. The wall at (3,3) is blocking the direct path, but if I can get around it by moving up and right.

This seems possible. So steps:

1. Move up from (-2,-2) to (-2, -2 + 5) = (-2, 3).

2. Move right to (-1,3), (0,3), (1,3).

3. From (1,3), move right to 6,3 (key's location).

But between (1,3) and (6,3), there's the wall at (3,3). So moving right from (1,3) to (3,3) is blocked. So need to go around the wall.

From (1,3), move up to (1,4), then right to (3,4), then down to (3,3), but that's the wall. Alternatively, move right past the wall by moving up and around.

Alternatively, after reaching (1,3), move right to (2,3), then up to (2,4), right to (4,4), down to (4,3), then right to (6,3). But this is getting complicated and may require passing through areas with walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is defined as win, maybe I can pick up the key and bring it to Baba. But in Baba Is You, you can't pick up objects; you have to move past them or use rules.

Wait, another thought: If I can make 'key is you', then touching the key would make me you, and since Baba is you, that might not help. Or if I can make 'baba is win', then just touching Baba would win.

To make 'baba is win', need to rearrange the 'key is win' rule into 'baba is win'. So move the 'key' block to where 'baba' is, the 'is' block between them, and 'win' where it needs to be.

The 'baba' rule is at (-2,-2) from origin. The 'key' rule is at (6,3). So need to move the 'key' block to (-2,-2), but that's where Baba is. Then the 'is' block would be at (-1,-2), and 'win' at (0,-2). But is that possible?

But moving the 'key' block all the way to Baba's position would require avoiding walls. The path is blocked by the wall at (3,3), but maybe by moving around.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to move the 'key is win' rule to the 'baba' location. Let's see:

The 'key' rule is at (6,3), 'is' at (7,3), 'win' at (8,3).

To make 'baba is win', need to place 'baba' at (x1,y1), 'is' at (x2,y2), and 'win' at (x3,y3).

The 'baba' rule is at (-2,-2). So the new 'is' would need to be next to 'baba', say at (-1,-2), and 'win' at (0,-2).

So moving the 'key' block from (6,3) to (-2,-2), 'is' from (7,3) to (-1,-2), and 'win' from (8,3) to (0,-2). That's a huge move, but possible if there's a clear path.

But navigating all those blocks through the map would require moving past many walls. It might be too time-consuming.

Alternative idea: Use the 'ball' rule. Since 'ball' isn't defined, maybe it's a movable object. If I can move the ball into a position that allows me to push other blocks.

But I'm not sure. The ball's rule is at (1 step right), so maybe it's at (1,0) if origin is (0,0). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is accessible if I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule. If walls are no longer stop, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to rearrange the 'wall is stop' rule into something else, like 'stop is wall' or 'wall is you'.

But changing 'wall is stop' would require moving the 'wall' text block, the 'is' block, and the 'stop' block. The 'wall' rule is at (-1,3) (since it's 1 step left and 3 up from origin), 'is' at (0,3), 'stop' at (1,3).

So to change 'wall is stop' to 'stop is wall', you would need to move the 'wall' block next to 'stop', connected by 'is'. So moving 'wall' from (-1,3) to (2,3), 'is' stays at (0,3), and 'stop' is at (1,3). Then the new rule would be 'stop is wall', making walls passable.

If that's possible, then I can walk through the walls and reach the key.

So steps:

1. Move the 'wall' block from (-1,3) to (2,3).

2. The 'is' block is at (0,3), so now the rule becomes 'stop is wall' at (0,3) connected to 'wall' at (2,3) and 'stop' at (1,3).

This would make walls no longer stoppers. Then I can walk through them.

Once that's done, I can go straight to the key at (6,3).

But how to move the 'wall' block? Need to navigate to (-1,3), which is where the 'wall' rule is. From Baba's position at (-2,-2), the path to (-1,3) would be:

Move right 1 step to (-1,-2).

Then move up 5 steps to (-1,3).

But on the way up, from (-1,-2) to (-1,3), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, walls are at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc. So (-1,3) should be clear.

So moving right then up:

Right once: (-1,-2)

Up five times: (-1,3)

Now at the 'wall' rule's location. To move the 'wall' block, need to touch it and drag it. Since 'wall is stop', but we're moving it, not breaking the rule yet.

Once at (-1,3), move the 'wall' block to the right to, say, (2,3). So each move would be right once, incrementing the x-coordinate.

From (-1,3) move right to (0,3): but there's an 'is' block at (0,3). Can't place the 'wall' there because it's adjacent to 'is'. So need to move further right.

Move right to (1,3): but there's a 'stop' block. Can't place 'wall' there.

Move right to (2,3): empty. Place the 'wall' block here.

Now the 'wall' is at (2,3), 'is' is at (0,3), 'stop' is at (1,3). The new rule would be 'stop is wall', making walls passable.

Once that's done, I can walk through any walls.

Then proceed to the key at (6,3).

From Baba's new position after moving the 'wall' block, which is at (2,3), move down to (-2,-2) isn't necessary. Wait, no, after moving the 'wall' block, Baba would be at (2,3). Then need to get back to the original area or go straight to the key.

Alternatively, from (2,3), move down to (2,0), then right to (6,3).

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is usually to reach the 'WIN' object, which is currently defined as the key. But the active rules say ""key is win"", so grabbing the key should make me win. But how do I get to the key?

Looking at the map, Baba is me (""baba is you""), so I need to move around the walls that are stopping me. The key is 5 steps to the right and 1 step down from where I am. But there's a wall blocking the path. Wait, the walls are defined as 'stop', so I can't move through them. I need to find a way around or maybe break the rules.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` 2 steps to the right. Maybe I can move that rule to change something. If I can create a new rule that makes 'BALL IS YOU' or 'BALL IS WIN', that might help. But first, I need to see if I can pick up the 'ball' rule.

The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. To get to it, I might need to move down or left. But the path is blocked by walls. Wait, maybe I can move the 'ball' rule instead of moving the ball itself. The rule `ball` is 2 steps to the right. If I can move that rule, maybe I can place it near the key or reassign properties.

Alternatively, perhaps moving the 'key is win' rule. The key is at 6 steps right, 3 steps up. The rule for 'key is win' is at 7 steps right, 3 steps up. If I can move that rule closer or combine it with something else. But I need to be able to move the text blocks. Remember, only objects not defined as 'STOP' can be moved. So, the 'is' rules and other text blocks might be movable if they're not stopped.

Wait, the current rules: wall is stop. So any object with 'stop' property can't be moved. But the 'is' rules and other text blocks might be movable. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects: there are multiple 'rule' blocks. For example, rule `wall` is at 2 left 3 up, rule `is` at 1 left 3 up, etc. These are probably text blocks that can be moved since they're not labeled as stop. So, maybe I can grab the 'ball' rule (which is a text block) and move it to create a new rule, like 'baba is win' or 'ball is you'.

If I can make myself (Baba) the win, then standing on the key or the ball would make me win. Alternatively, making the ball a win. Let's see. The key is currently the win, but it's behind a wall. The ball is at 5 right, 2 up. If I can move the 'win' rule to the ball's location, then grabbing the ball would make me win. But how?

First, I need to move the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right, 3 steps up. To get there, I need to navigate past the walls. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right, 2 up and others. Maybe I can move a different rule first.

Alternatively, move the 'ball' rule (which is at 2 steps right) towards the key. If I can place 'ball is win' near the key, then the key would become the win. But I need to get the 'ball' rule next to the key. But how?

Let me think step by step. My position isn't specified here, but assuming I'm at Baba's position, which is at 2 left and 2 steps down from the 'baba' rule. Wait, the rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba's position is possibly at that location. Let me visualize:

The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 2 down. So if the rule is placed there, Baba is at that position. So I need to move from there.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 5 right, 1 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, 1 up and other walls blocking the path. Maybe I can push a wall aside? But walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless there's a rule that changes that.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I can change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is not stop', then I could walk through walls. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall is stop' rule and reassign it.

But how to move the 'wall is stop' rule? It's at 2 left, 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. But I might be blocked by other objects.

Wait, the 'rule `wall`' is at 2 left, 3 up. That's the text block for 'wall is stop'. If I can move that text block, I could change the rule. But to move it, I need to be next to it. Let's see where I am. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 2 down. So my position is likely at 2 left, 2 down. The 'wall' rule is 2 left, 3 up. So from my position, to get to the 'wall' rule, I need to move up two steps. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, 3 up. Wait, the wall is 3 steps to the right and 3 up. So my position is 2 left, 2 down. To reach the 'wall' rule at 2 left, 3 up, I need to move up one step. But is there a wall in the way?

Looking at the map, the wall at 3 steps right, 3 up is at 3 right, 3 up. My position is 2 left, 2 down. So moving up from there would take me towards the 'wall' rule at 2 left, 3 up. But the path is blocked by other walls? Not sure. Maybe I can move up.

Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the 'ball' rule. The 'rule `ball`' is at 2 steps right. So if I can move that rule to create a new rule, like 'ball is you', then the ball would become me, and I could move it to reach the key or the win condition.

But how to move the 'ball' rule. It's at 2 steps right. My position is at 2 left, 2 down. So to reach the 'ball' rule, I need to move right three steps? But there's a wall at 3 steps right. Wait, the wall at 3 steps right is at various positions, but maybe the path is blocked. Alternatively, perhaps moving diagonally?

This is getting complicated. Maybe the quickest way is to grab the 'win' rule and move it to the key's location. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right, 3 steps up. The key is at 6 steps right, 3 steps up. If I can move the 'win' rule one step left, it would be at 7 steps right, 3 steps up, which is where the 'is' rule is. Then, combining 'key is win' by moving the 'win' rule next to the 'key' rule.

But to do that, I need to move the 'win' rule from 8 right, 3 up to 7 right, 3 up. That would require moving left one step. But is the 'win' rule movable? It's a text block, so unless it's stopped, it should be movable. The 'win' rule's property is not 'stop', so it can be moved.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the location of the 'win' rule (8 right, 3 up).
2. Move the 'win' rule left one step to 7 right, 3 up, placing it next to the 'key is win' rule components (which are at 6 right, 3 up for 'key' and 7 right, 3 up for 'is').
3. Combine them to form 'key is win' (but it's already there). Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to the key's position (6 right, 3 up), making 'key is win' by placing 'win' next to 'key'.

Wait, the 'key is win' rule is made by the 'key' rule at 6 right, 3 up and the 'is' rule at 7 right, 3 up, and the 'win' rule at 8 right, 3 up. So to create a new 'key is win' elsewhere, I need to place 'key', 'is', 'win' in sequence.

If I can move the 'win' rule next to the key, then the rule would be 'key is win' where the key is. So if I move the 'win' rule from 8 right to 6 right, 3 up (same as the key), then the rules would be 'key is win' at that location. Then, standing on the key would make me win.

But how to move the 'win' rule. Let's see. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 3 up. To move it left, I need to be adjacent to it and move left. To get to 8 right, 3 up from my current position (2 left, 2 down), I need to move right 10 steps and up 5 steps. That's a long way with walls in the way. Probably not feasible.

Alternative approach: Use the 'ball' rule. The 'ball' rule is at 2 right. If I can move it to create 'ball is win', then maybe interacting with the ball would make me win. Or 'ball is you', making the ball controllable.

To create 'ball is you', I need to have the 'ball' rule next to a 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 2 steps down, 1 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, the 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down from where? The 'rule `you`' is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So placing the 'ball' rule next to the 'you' rule would create 'ball is you'.

So if I can move the 'ball' rule (which is at 2 right) to the position next to the 'you' rule, that would work. The 'you' rule is at 1 left and 2 down. My current position is 2 left and 2 down (Baba's position). So moving right to the 'ball' rule (which is 2 right from where?), wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to map coordinates.

Assuming Baba's position is at the location of the 'rule `baba`' which is 2 left and 2 down. So coordinates could be (0,0) for Baba, but the rules are placed relative to him. For example, 'rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 3 step up' would be at (-1, 3) relative to Baba.

So:

- Baba's position: (0, 0)
- rule `wall` at (-1, 3)
- rule `is` at (-2, 3)
- rule `stop` at (1, 3)
- wall at (2, 3)
- rule `key` at (5, 3)
- rule `is` at (6, 3)
- rule `win` at (7, 3)
- wall at (2, 2)
- ball at (4, 2)
- wall at (2, 1)
- rule `ball` at (1, 2)
- wall at (2, 0)
- wall at (2, -1)
- key at (4, -1)
- rule `baba` at (-1, -2)
- rule `is` at (-2, -2)
- rule `you` at (-1, -2) ??? Wait, the 'you' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? The 'rule `you`' is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the 'rule `is`' at (-2, -2). So maybe it's at (-3, -2).

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for movable text blocks and see how to rearrange them.

The key is at (5,3), and it's the win. But there's a wall at (2,3) and others blocking the path. The ball is at (4,2), which is closer. If I can make the ball a win, then standing on it would make me win. To do that, I need to create 'ball is win' rule. The existing 'win' rule is at (7,3). If I can move the 'win' rule to (4,2), which is the ball's location, then 'ball is win' would be formed.

But moving the 'win' rule from (7,3) to (4,2) requires moving left 3 and down 1. That's possible if the path is clear. However, there are walls at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), etc. So maybe not.

Alternative idea: Use the 'ball' rule at (1,2). If I can move this 'ball' rule next to the 'win' rule, then combining them with an 'is' rule would create 'ball is win'. The 'is' rule is at (6,3) and (8,3). Wait, the 'is' rules are at various positions. For example, there's an 'is' rule at (-2,3), (6,3), (8,3), (-2,-2), (1,-2).

So if I can move the 'ball' rule (at (1,2)) to be next to the 'win' rule (at (7,3)) and an 'is' rule, that would create 'ball is win'. But how to get them close.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to the 'ball' rule's location. The 'win' rule is at (7,3). To get there, I need to move from Baba's position (0,0) to (7,3). That's right 7, up 3. But there are walls at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), which are in the way. So maybe can't move straight.

Another approach: Move the 'is' rule next to the 'ball' and 'win' rules. For example, take the 'is' rule at (8,3) and move it left to connect with 'win' and 'ball'. But again, path is blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution is to push a wall aside by using a rule. For example, if I can change 'wall is stop' to something else, but that requires moving the 'wall is stop' rule.

The 'wall is stop' rule is at (-1,3). To move it, I need to be adjacent. From Baba's position (0,0), moving up to (-1,3) requires moving left 1 and up 3. But the way is blocked by walls at (2,3), but that's to the right. Maybe I can move left and up.

Wait, from (0,0), moving left 1 step would be to (-1,0), which is the position of the 'rule `baba`' (since it's 2 steps left and 2 down from Baba, so maybe coordinates are different). This is getting too confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, focus on the immediate objects. The key is at (5,3), win is there. The ball is at (4,2). The 'ball' rule is at (1,2). If I can move the 'ball' rule to (4,2), next to the ball, and then maybe combine it with 'win' and 'is' to make 'ball is win'.

To move the 'ball' rule from (1,2) to (4,2), I need to move right 3 steps. But there's a wall at (2,2). So I can't move right past (2,2). Unless I can move the wall, but walls are stop.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule that's at (6,3) down to (4,3), then move the 'win' rule to (5,3). But this requires navigating around walls.

I think the key is to manipulate the rules to change what is win. Since the key is win, but it's blocked, maybe making the ball win would be easier. To do that, create 'ball is win' near the ball. The 'ball' rule is at (1,2), the 'win' rule is at (7,3). The 'is' rule is at (6,3). So if I can move the 'is' rule from (6,3) to (1,2), then place 'ball' and 'win' next to it. But that's a long move.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' rule at (8,3) which is part of 'key is win'. If I can move that 'is' rule to connect with 'ball' and 'win', but again, path is blocked.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'you' rule onto the key. Since 'key is win' and 'baba is you', if I can make Baba the key, then touching the key would win. To do that, change 'baba is you' to 'key is you'. But how?

The 'you' rule is at (-1,-2) relative to Baba. So to move the 'you' rule to the key's location (5,3), I need to move it right 6 and up 5. That's impractical.

Another Idea: Use the ball. If I can make 'ball is you', then move the ball to the key. The 'ball' rule is at (1,2). The 'you' rule is at (-1,-2). To move the 'you' rule to (1,2), that's right 2, up 4. From Baba's position (0,0), moving to (1,2) requires right 1, up 2. Then move the 'you' rule from (-1,-2) to (1,2). But this seems too complex.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for the nearest movable text block. The 'ball' rule is at (1,2), which is one step right and two steps up from Baba. If I can move that 'ball' rule","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba since ""baba is you"" makes me the player. My goal is usually to reach the key or the win object, but right now key is defined as win. So getting the key should make me win? Or maybe touching the key counts as winning because key is win.

Looking at the map, there's a key at 6 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, no, checking the objects: rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up. But the key itself is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. But there's also a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the rules are stacked. Let me parse this again.

The objects are listed as:
- rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 step up
- wall 3 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 6 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 7 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `win` 8 steps right and 3 step up
Then lower positions.

So the wall at 3 steps right and 3 up is a stop, meaning I can't move through it. The key is at 6 steps right and 3 up, but between me (Baba) and the key, there's the wall at 3 steps right and 3 up. So how do I get past that?

Wait, where am I located? The rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So my position is 2 left and 2 down from where? Maybe the reference point is the initial position? Not sure, but looking at the other objects, the key is 6 steps right and 3 up from some origin. Maybe I need to move right towards the key, but there's a wall blocking the path.

But the active rules are wall is stop, so I can't move into the wall. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules. The key is win, so if I can get to the key, I win. But how to get past the wall?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 2 steps right. Maybe I can move that rule? But the rule says that objects defined as stop can't be moved. Wait, the rules are part of the text blocks. To move a text block, I have to move it if it's not stopped. So if a text block is not stopped, I can move it. The current rules are wall is stop, so any wall is stop, but the text blocks themselves (like the rules) might not be stopped unless they're part of a wall.

Wait, the rules are separate objects. For example, the rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 step up is a text block that says ""WALL IS STOP"". To move that rule, I need to check if it's stopped. Since wall is stop, does that apply to the text blocks? Or does it apply to the walls created by the rules?

This is a bit confusing. In Baba Is You, usually, when a rule is set, like ""WALL IS STOP"", any object named WALL becomes stop. So the text blocks themselves are not stopped unless they are of a type that's stopped. But maybe the text blocks can be moved unless they are part of a STOP rule.

In this case, the rule `wall` is a text block that creates the wall objects. So the text block ""WALL IS STOP"" is not itself stopped unless there's a rule that says ""RULE IS STOP"" or something. But the current rules don't have that. So maybe I can move the rule `wall` to change the rules.

If I can move the rule `wall` to a different position, then the wall rule would no longer be active, making walls not stop. Then I could move around them. Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes me not stop. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can change ""baba"" to something else.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 2 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule, I could change ""baba is you"" to something else. For example, making ""baba is win"" so that I become the win condition. But how?

Alternatively, create a rule that says ""YOU IS WIN"", but right now ""you"" is defined by the rule at 1 step right and 2 steps down: ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"". If I can move that rule to say ""YOU IS WIN"", then touching the key (which is win) would not be necessary because I would be the win.

But to do that, I need to either move the existing ""you"" rule or create a new ""you is win"" rule. However, moving the ""you"" rule might require moving it past walls or other stopped objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball. There's a ball at 5 steps right and 2 step up. If I can move the ball, maybe I can use it to push walls or other blocks. But the ball's rule is at 1 step right, which is ""BALL IS ..."". Wait, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right. If I can change that rule to make the ball not stop, then maybe I can move it to interact with other objects.

But I'm not sure. Let me think step by step.

First, my goal is to reach the key, which is win. But path is blocked by a wall. To remove the wall, I can either move the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule or create a rule that makes walls not stop. Alternatively, make myself able to pass through walls.

Since ""baba is you"", if I can change ""baba"" to ""baba is not stop"", then I could move through walls. To do that, I need to either modify the existing ""baba is you"" rule or create a new rule.

The existing ""baba"" rule is at 2 step left and 2 steps down: ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". If I can move that rule to say ""baba is not stop"", then I could pass through walls. But how to rephrase that rule? The rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So to make baba not stop, I need to create a rule ""BABA IS NOT STOP"". But the current rules don't have that.

Alternatively, maybe I can destroy the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. If I can move that rule off the screen or somewhere else, then walls would no longer be stop. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe by pushing it with another object or moving it sideways.

But how to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since it's a text block, and there's no rule preventing it from being moved (unless it's considered a stop object). But walls are stop, but the rule itself is a text block. Unless the rule ""WALL IS STOP"" applies to the text blocks, which would make the rule itself a stop. But I don't think that's how it works. The rule creates the property that walls are stop, but the rule itself is a separate object.

Assuming the rule ""WALL IS STOP"" can be moved, then I can move it to a different location. For example, move it to the right so that it's no longer affecting the walls. Once that rule is moved, walls would no longer be stop, allowing me to pass through them.

Looking at the current positions:

- The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up.
- There's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up.

If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to the left, maybe overlapping with the wall, then the wall's stop property would be removed. But I need to check if moving the rule is possible.

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""wall is not stop"". But I need text blocks for that.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I can reach it by moving around using other objects. For example, pushing the ball to create a path. But the ball is at 5 steps right and 2 step up. If I can move the ball, maybe I can use it to block or unblock something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can get to the key, I win. But the path is blocked by a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. To get past that wall, I need to either remove the wall's stop property or make myself able to bypass it.

So, focusing on moving the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Since I'm at rule `baba` 2 step left and 2 steps down, which I assume is my position. Let me parse my position again.

The rule `baba` is located at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down from where? The reference point is probably the initial position, but in Baba Is You, the positions are relative. Maybe the grid is such that each step is a direction from a reference point. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, think about the positions in terms of coordinates. Suppose the current position of Baba (the rule `baba`) is at (x, y). Then other objects are relative to that. For example, rule `wall` is 2 left and 3 up from Baba's position. So if I move Baba, the positions of the rules would change accordingly. But I'm not sure. This might require knowing the exact grid layout.

But perhaps a simpler approach: look for movable objects. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up. If I can move that rule to the left or right, perhaps I can deactivate the wall rule. To move the rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it.

Assuming that the rule is a separate object that can be moved if it's not stopped. Since the rule itself isn't a wall, and there's no rule saying ""RULE IS STOP"", I should be able to move it.

So, my plan is: move to the position of the ""wall is stop"" rule and push it left or right to remove it from affecting the walls. Once that rule is moved, the walls won't be stop anymore, and I can path through them to the key.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""wall is stop"" rule. The rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up from my current position (since the rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 2 steps down). So from my position, moving left 2 and up 3 would reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how do I get there?

Wait, my position is where the rule `baba` is located, which is 2 step left and 2 steps down from the origin. The ""wall is stop"" rule is 2 step left and 3 step up from the origin. So relative to me, that rule is (2 left from origin) - (my 2 left from origin) = same x-coordinate, and 3 up from origin - my 2 down from origin = 5 up. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is 5 steps up from me.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe all positions are relative to each other. The ""wall is stop"" rule is 2 step left and 3 step up from the origin, and I'm 2 step left and 2 step down from the origin. So the distance between me and the ""wall is stop"" rule is (2 left vs my 2 left) same x, and 3 up vs my -2 down, so total 5 up. So to reach it, I need to move up 5 steps. But there are walls along the way.

Alternatively, maybe the grid is laid out such that moving up from my position (baba's rule) would take me towards the ""wall is stop"" rule. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the wall is at 3 steps right and 3 step up from the origin. If I'm at 2 step left and 2 step down from the origin, then moving up would take me towards the wall.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Let's try to outline possible moves.

My current position: rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So if I move up, I might be able to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule which is 2 left and 3 up from origin. But I need to navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""key is win"" rule. The key is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move the key to be where I am, but that's not possible because the key is an object, not a rule. Unless I can push it with another object, like the ball.

The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 step up. If I can move the ball towards the key's position, maybe I can push the key? But keys are probably not pushable unless there's a rule allowing it.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the ball win. If I can move the ""win"" rule to the ball's position, then touching the ball would make me win. But how?

The ""win"" rule is currently at 8 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that rule to the ball's position (5 steps right, 2 step up), then the ball would become win. But moving the ""win"" rule requires getting to its current position, which is blocked by walls.

This seems complicated. Let me think differently. What if I make myself win by changing the ""you"" rule. The current ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. If I can move that rule to say ""YOU IS WIN"", then since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I would become win.

To do that, I need to move the existing ""you"" rule. The rule `you` is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. My position is at rule `baba` which is 2 step left and 2 steps down. So relative to me, the ""you"" rule is 3 steps to the right (my position is 2 left, so 2 left + 1 right = 1 right from me?) and same y-coordinate (2 steps down from origin, so same as me).

Wait, if I'm at 2 left and 2 down, and the ""you"" rule is at 1 right and 2 down, then the distance between me and the ""you"" rule is 3 steps to the right. So to reach it, I need to move right 3 times. But along the way, is there anything blocking?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step right. So if I move right from my position, I would first go to 1 step right (rule `ball`), then 2 steps right (wall?), then 3 steps right (key's position). Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up is a stop, but that's up, not in the right direction. Moving right from my position, the first object is the rule `ball` at 1 step right. Then at 2 steps right, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe moving right from my position (baba's rule at 2 left, 2 down) would take me past the rule `ball` at 1 step right. So if I move right, I can get to the ""you"" rule at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, no: the ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from the origin, which is the same as my position's 2 left + 1 right = 1 right, and same down. So the ""you"" rule is adjacent to me on the right. So I can move right once to get to the ""you"" rule.

Once I'm next to the ""you"" rule, I can push it. Since there's no rule saying ""rule is stop"", I can move it. If I move the ""you"" rule to the right, it would become ""YOU IS WIN"" if positioned correctly. But how to rephrase the rule?

The current ""you"" rule is ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"", which means the text block ""YOU IS..."" is located there. To change it to ""YOU IS WIN"", I need to move that text block to a position where the rule would be ""YOU IS WIN"". But the text blocks are in specific positions, and their labels are determined by their placement.

Wait, no. The text blocks have their text determined by their content. For example, the rule at position X says ""YOU IS WIN"" would be a text block placed at X with that text. But the existing ""you"" rule is a text block that says ""YOU IS ..."", but what exactly? The observation shows ""rule `you` 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"", which probably means the text block is ""YOU IS [something]"". But in the active rules, it's ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""you"" rule must be part of the original level setup.

Wait, looking back at the active rules: ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". So the ""you"" rule must be part of the original level, possibly defining what is ""you"". In this case, the ""you"" rule is likely ""BABA IS YOU"", but it's placed at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the active rules listed are the three mentioned. The other rules like ""stop"" and ""win"" are part of the level's text blocks.

So to change the ""you"" condition, I need to either move the existing ""you"" rule to create a new rule or create a new rule. But the existing ""you"" rule is part of the level's setup. If I can move it, I can place it to say ""YOU IS WIN"".

For example, if I move the ""you"" rule to a position where the text would be ""YOU IS WIN"", but how? The text of the rule is determined by where it's placed. So if I move the ""you"" rule to a new position, the rule's text would change based on its new position relative to other objects.","

I need to figure out the correct action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by understanding the current state based on the observation.

First, the active rules are: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, any object labeled 'wall' has the 'stop' property, meaning I can't move through them. The 'key' is the 'win' object, so getting to the key should win the level. And since baba is you, whatever I do as Baba counts as an action.

Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a 'rule ball 2 steps to the right' which probably means the rule ""BALL IS ..."" is positioned somewhere. The ball itself is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down, and it's the win condition. 

Baba's position is at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down relative to some reference point. The 'rule baba' is there with 'is' and 'you', so that confirms baba is you.

The walls are forming a structure that might block paths. The key is below the ball, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, which might be a barrier. Also, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. 

The goal is to get to the key, which is win. So, how to reach it? Let's map out possible paths. If I move right from my current position (rule baba at 2 left, 2 down), moving right would take me towards the key area. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is probably blocking the path. 

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The 'rule ball' is at 2 steps to the right. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the property of ball. For example, if I make ball IS YOU, then I could turn into the ball and move over walls. Or if I make ball IS WIN, then touching the ball would win. 

Wait, the key is already the win, but maybe the ball is in the way. Let me check the positions again. The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 up, while the key is at 5 right and 1 down. So, the ball is above the key. If I can move the ball down, maybe I can path around it. But how?

The rule 'ball' is at 2 steps to the right. If I can grab that text block and move it, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, moving the 'ball is' rule to say 'ball is win' would make the ball the win condition. Then I could push the ball to the key's location? Not sure. Alternatively, making ball is you so I can turn into the ball and move through walls.

But to do that, I need to move the 'rule ball' text block. The rule 'ball' is 2 steps to the right of the current position (rule baba is at 2 left, 2 down). So, the rule ball is positioned such that from Baba's location, it's 2 steps to the right. Let's say Baba is at position (x, y), then the rule ball is at (x+2, y). To move that rule, I need to move right twice? But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. Wait, the walls are at various positions, maybe forming a grid.

Alternatively, maybe moving the 'is' rule that's associated with ball. The rule 'ball' is paired with an 'is' block. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up, which might be part of the 'wall is stop' rule. Then, the 'rule ball' is at 2 steps to the right, and the 'is' for ball is probably nearby. If I can move the 'is' next to the 'ball' rule, I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the 'is' block to the right next to the 'ball' rule, it would become 'ball is [something]'. Since currently, the 'ball' rule is just 'ball', maybe I can add a property to it.

But what's the current setup? The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The text blocks on the map include rule `ball` 1 step to the right, which might mean the 'ball' rule is one step to the right of something. Maybe the 'is' block is missing next to it, so I need to move the 'is' there to form a complete rule.

If I can move the 'is' block that's currently at 1 step to the left and 3 step up (part of the wall is stop rule) to the position of the 'ball' rule, which is 2 steps to the right, then I can create a new rule like 'ball is [property]'. But where is the 'is' block located exactly?

The objects list shows:

- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `ball` 2 steps to the right

So, the 'is' is at a different position than the 'ball' rule. To attach them, I need to move either the 'is' to the 'ball' or vice versa. Since the 'is' is 1 step left and 3 up from wherever the reference point is, and the 'ball' rule is 2 steps right, perhaps they are not adjacent. 

Alternatively, maybe the 'is' that's part of the 'ball' rule is missing. Currently, the active rules don't have a 'ball is' rule, only 'key is win' and 'wall is stop'. The 'baba is you' is active. So, the 'ball' rule is present but without an 'is' property, meaning it's just a standalone text block. To make a rule, I need to pair it with an 'is'.

If I can move the available 'is' blocks to the 'ball' rule, then I can create a new rule. The available 'is' blocks are at 1 step left and 3 up, and another at positions related to the key and win rules. For example, there's a rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up (part of 'key is win'), and another at 7 steps right and 3 up (part of 'win is ...'). 

The 'is' block that's 1 step left and 3 up is probably near the top left of the map. To reach the 'ball' rule at 2 steps right, I might need to move right towards it. But the path might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the wall positions:

- wall 3 steps right and 3 steps down (the bottom right corner)
- wall 3 steps right and 2 steps down
- wall 3 steps right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps right and 2 step up
- wall 3 steps right and 3 step up (top right)

So, the right side has walls forming a vertical block from up to down. The only way to the right might be blocked. But the 'ball' rule is at 2 steps right, which is within reach if I can move right twice. However, the wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down is probably the bottom right wall, but the current position of Baba is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So, moving right from there would take him towards the right side.

Wait, the exact positions might be a bit confusing without a visual, but based on the steps:

Baba's position is at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, if the reference point is, say, the top-left corner, then moving right would increase the x-coordinate.

But perhaps the key is to interact with the 'ball' rule. If I can make ball IS YOU, then I can turn into the ball and move over walls. Alternatively, make ball IS WIN, so touching the ball wins.

To do that, I need to form the rule 'ball is [property]'. The existing 'rule ball' is at 2 steps to the right, and there's an 'is' block at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move the 'is' block to the right next to the 'ball' rule, that would create the rule.

But how to move the 'is' block? The 'is' at 1 step left and 3 step up is part of the 'wall is stop' rule. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since Baba is at 2 left and 2 down, moving left would take him to the 'is' block's position? Let's see:

Baba's position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, if the reference point is, say, the top-left corner, then moving left from there would go further left, but the 'is' block is 1 step left and 3 step up. Maybe the coordinates are relative to Baba's current position. This is a bit confusing without a map visualization.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move towards the key, which is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. From Baba's current position (assuming he's at the position of the 'baba' rule), moving right multiple times might get him to the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is blocking the path to the right. However, if I can push the wall or break the rule, maybe by changing its property.

Since wall is stop, but if I can change wall to not stop, like wall is push or something, but I don't have the text blocks for that. Alternatively, if I make myself (Baba) a ball, then I can move through walls. To do that, I need to create the rule 'baba is ball' by moving the 'ball' rule next to an 'is' block and then moving 'baba' next to it. But that might be complicated.

Another angle: The key is win, so touching the key wins. The key is at 5 right, 1 down. There's a ball at 5 right, 2 up. So, the path to the key is blocked by the ball. If I can move the ball out of the way, perhaps by pushing it, but the ball's property is not specified. If ball is stop, then I can't push it. If ball is push, then I can. But currently, ball doesn't have a property, so maybe it's default to stop? Or maybe since it's a rule block, it's movable.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. So, the text block 'ball' is there, but without an 'is', so it's just a label. To make it movable, I need to assign it a property. For example, 'ball is push' would let me push it. Alternatively, 'ball is you' so I can move as the ball.

Alternatively, maybe the ball is already a stop, but since it's a text block, not an object, perhaps it's not. This is getting a bit tangled.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Move to the 'ball' rule and attach an 'is' to create a new rule. For example, 'ball is you', allowing me to become the ball and move through walls.
2. Once I'm the ball, move down to the key and win.

To do step 1, I need to reach the 'ball' rule and the 'is' block. The 'is' block is at 1 step left and 3 step up from Baba's position. Moving left from Baba's position (which is 2 left, 2 down) would take me further left, but the 'is' is 1 left and 3 up. Maybe the coordinates are such that moving up and left from Baba's position gets me to the 'is' block.

Alternatively, maybe the best path is to move right towards the key, overcoming the walls by changing rules. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move through them.

But to change the wall's property, I need to alter the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up, and the 'is' is 1 left and 3 up. So, the 'wall is stop' rule is formed by those two blocks. If I can move either the 'wall' or 'is' block, I can change the rule.

For instance, moving the 'is' block away from the 'wall' rule would break the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls not stop. Then I could move through them. But to do that, I need to grab the 'is' block. The 'is' block is at 1 step left and 3 step up from Baba's position. So, moving up and left from Baba's current location (2 left, 2 down) would reach that 'is' block.

Once I have the 'is' block, I can move it to near the 'key' or 'win' rules to create new rules. Alternatively, move it to the 'ball' rule to create 'ball is ...'.

But the key is at 5 right, 1 down. From Baba's position, moving right three times would get to x=5, same as the key, but y=1 down. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which blocks the path. If walls can be passed by changing their property, then that's an option.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall a push, then maybe I can push it aside. But again, that requires altering the 'wall is stop' rule.

This is quite complex. Let's try to focus on the immediate actions.

Current position of Baba: rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So, if I'm at position (0,0), then Baba is at (-2, -2). The 'is' block is at (-1, 3) (1 step left and 3 up). The 'ball' rule is at (2, 0) (2 steps to the right). The key is at (5, -1).

To get to the key, need to move right 5 times and down 1. But walls are at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc. So moving right past x=3 is blocked.

Alternative plan: Change the 'ball' rule to be 'ball is you', then move as the ball through the walls.

To do that, need to get the 'is' block next to the 'ball' rule. The 'ball' rule is at (2,0), and the 'is' block is at (-1,3). They are not adjacent. So, need to move the 'is' block to (2,0).

How to move the 'is' block from (-1,3) to (2,0)? That would require moving right 3 times and down 3 times. But Baba is at (-2,-2). So, from Baba's position, moving right twice gets to (0,-2). Then, moving up to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), then right to (1,3), (2,3), then down to (2,0). But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the wall positions:

- wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down (which would be (3,-3) if reference is (0,0))
- wall at 3 right, 2 down: (3,-2)
- wall at 3 right, 1 up: (3,1)
- wall at 3 right, 2 up: (3,2)
- wall at 3 right, 3 up: (3,3)

So, moving right from Baba's position (assuming (0,0) as reference shifted), moving right to (2,0) is possible until x=3, which is blocked. So, moving right to x=2 is okay. But the path from (-2,-2) to (2,0) involves moving right twice, up three times, then right again. But there's a wall at (3,-3), but we're only going to (2,0), which is clear.

Wait, the walls are at x=3, various y positions. So moving right to x=2 is allowed. So, possible path:

From (-2,-2) → right to (0,-2) → up to (0,1) → up to (0,2) → up to (0,3) → right to (1,3) → right to (2,3) → down to (2,2) → down to (2,1) → down to (2,0).

But along this path, are there any walls? The walls are at x=3, so as long as we don't reach x=3, it's clear. So this path is possible.

Once at (2,0), which is the 'ball' rule, then attach the 'is' block from (-1,3) to here. But to do that, need to carry the 'is' block. So, move to the 'is' block at (-1,3), pick it up, and move it to (2,0).

Steps:

1. From Baba's position (-2,-2), move up three times to ( -2,1 ), ( -2,2 ), ( -2,3 ).
2. Move right to ( -1,3 ), where the 'is' block is.
3. Grab the 'is' block and move right three times and down three times to (2,0), the 'ball' rule's position.
4. Place the 'is' block next to 'ball', creating 'ball is ...'. Now, decide what property to assign. To make ball IS YOU, then 'ball is you' would let us become the ball.
5. Then, move as the ball to the key at (5,-1), passing through walls since ball is now you.

But this requires multiple steps and moving the 'is' block, which might be possible. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, maybe the 'key is win' rule can be altered. If I can make 'key is stop', then the key becomes a wall, but that's not helpful. Or make 'win is key', which it already is. Not helpful.

Another idea: The 'rule you' is at 2 steps down. If I can change 'you' to something else, like 'you is win', then touching anything that is win would make me win. But I need to reach the 'you' rule.

The 'rule you' is at 2 steps down from Baba's position. So","

The goal is to move the key and reach the win condition. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, Baba is the player. The key is labeled as win, which means picking it up might not be necessary because the rule says key is win. Maybe the objective is just to be at the key's position since it's defined as win. But I need to check the map layout.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down from the current position. There's a rule `you` at 2 steps down. The rule `baba` is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe I need to move Baba to the key's location.

But there are walls around. The wall is stop, so I can't move into them. Let me visualize the grid. Let's assume Baba's current position is the reference point. To get to the key at (5 right, 1 down), I need to move right multiple times and down once. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, and other walls blocking the path. Also, the rule `ball` is at 2 steps right, which might be movable if it's not a stop. Wait, the active rules say wall is stop, but ball's rule is not defined here. The original rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The rule `ball` is present as a text block, but since there's no 'ball is stop' or 'ball is you', it's probably movable unless there's another rule I'm missing.

Wait, the active rules are only wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So any object not stopped can be moved. So the ball can be moved. If I can move the ball out of the way, maybe that creates a path. Let's see the map again.

Current position: Assume Baba is at the position where the `baba` rule is, which is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from some reference. Wait, the objects list has rule `baba` at 2 step left and 2 steps down. So if that's the position, then moving right might get towards the key.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 2 steps down from the current reference point (maybe the initial position). So to reach the key at 5 right and 1 down, I need to navigate around walls.

The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions up, 2 steps up, 1 step up, etc. The path to the key seems blocked by walls. Maybe moving the `ball` rule text block could help. The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ball to another spot, perhaps it allows passage.

But how to move objects? Since I'm Baba (you), I can push objects that are not stopped. So if there's no 'stop' rule on the ball, I can move it. The active rules don't mention ball as stop, so yes, I can move it. So the plan might be to move the ball out of the way to create a path to the key.

The ball is at 5 right and 2 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent and move in a direction. Let's see where I am. The `baba` rule is at 2 left and 2 down. So my current position is perhaps the intersection of those rules. Maybe my position is at (0,0), and the rules are placed around me.

Alternatively, the reference point might be the position of the `baba` text block. But this is getting complicated. Let me try to sketch the grid based on the observations.

Assume Baba's position is where the `baba` rule is located: 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So if that's considered (0,0), then:

- rule `wall` is at (-2, 3)
- rule `is` at (-1, 3)
- rule `stop` at (1, 3)
- wall at (3, 3)
- rule `key` at (6, 3)
- etc.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should focus on relative movements.

The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down from the current position. The path there is blocked by walls at 3 steps right in various positions. The ball is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move the ball down, maybe that opens a path.

To move the ball, I need to be adjacent to it. The ball is at (5 right, 2 up). My current position is where the `baba` rule is: 2 left and 2 down. So from my position, moving right 7 steps would get to the ball's x-coordinate, but there are walls in the way at 3 steps right. So that's not feasible.

Alternative approach: Maybe rearrange the rules. For example, if I can change 'key is win' to something else, but I don't see a 'win' rule except the key. Or maybe make 'baba is win' to reach the key without picking it up. But to do that, I need to move the 'baba' text block and 'is' and 'win' text blocks to form 'baba is win'.

Looking at the objects, there's a `win` rule at 8 right, 3 up. The `is` rule is at 7 right, 3 up. The `baba` rule is at 2 left, 2 down. So to make 'baba is win', I need to move the `baba` text block next to `is`, then next to `win`.

But how to move those text blocks? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move any object that's not stop. The active rules say wall is stop, but text blocks like 'is', 'you', etc., are probably movable unless there's a 'stop' rule on them. Since there's no 'text is stop' rule, they can be moved.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the `baba` text block to the right and down to align with `is` and `win`.
2. Form the rule 'baba is win', which would make Baba the win condition, so reaching any 'win' object (like the key) would complete the level.

To do this, I need to navigate to the `baba` text block's position (2 left, 2 down) and move it. But wait, the `baba` text block's position is where the rule is defined. So to move the rule, I need to move the text blocks 'baba', 'is', and 'you' accordingly.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, maybe I can push the text blocks if they are next to me. Let's see the current positions:

- `baba` rule is at 2 step left and 2 steps down from my current position (assuming I'm at the position where the `baba` rule is applied). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should consider my position as the center, and all other objects are relative to me.

In that case, my position is where the `baba is you` rule applies. The `baba` text block is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from me. The `is` text block is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. The `you` text block is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, same as the `is`? Wait, no, looking at the objects:

rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down

rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down

rule `you` 2 steps down

So the `you` is directly 2 steps down from the reference point, while `baba` and `is` are to the left at 2 and 1 steps left respectively.

So my position is the reference point, and the rules are placed around me. To move the `baba` text block (which is 2 left, 2 down), I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. But since it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down, I'd have to move left twice and down twice to reach it, but there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` and `win` text blocks to form a new rule. The `win` is at 8 right, 3 up. The `is` is at 7 right, 3 up. So if I can move the `is` one step right to be next to `win`, then place the `baba` next to `is`, forming 'baba is win'.

To do that, I need to move the `is` text block from 7 right, 3 up to 8 right, 3 up (next to `win`). Then move the `baba` text block from 2 left, 2 down to 7 right, 3 up? That seems impossible due to distance and walls.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a shorter path. Let's see the current positions:

- `win` rule: 8 right, 3 up

- `is` rule: 7 right, 3 up

So to make 'baba is win', we need `baba` next to `is`, then `is` next to `win`. The current setup has `is` one step left of `win`. So moving `is` one step right would align it with `win`.

But how to move the `is` text block? Since I'm Baba, I can push it if it's not stopped. The active rules don't say `text is stop`, so it's movable. The `is` is at 7 right, 3 up. To move it right to 8 right, 3 up (where `win` is), I need to be adjacent to it and move right. But where am I?

Assuming my position is the reference point (0,0), then the `is` is at (7,3). To get to (7,3), I need to move right 7 steps and up 3 steps, but there are walls at 3 right, various ups. For example, at 3 steps right and 3 up, there's a wall. So moving right past that is blocked.

This seems challenging. Maybe another approach: Since the key is labeled as win, perhaps just reaching the key's position is enough. The key is at 5 right, 1 down. To get there, I need to move right and down, but there's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. Wait, the walls are at 3 right and 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, etc. So the path to the key at 5 right, 1 down might be blocked by walls at 3 right.

Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right in different directions. For example, wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up, which is diagonally northeast from my position. Then wall at 3 right and 2 up, 3 right and 1 up, etc. So moving right past 3 would hit these walls. Therefore, the direct path to the key is blocked.

Alternative idea: Use the ball to collapse a wall. If the ball can be moved into a wall's position, perhaps it can destroy the wall. But the rules don't mention ball having any effect. Unless there's a hidden rule, like 'ball is push' or something, but the active rules don't indicate that.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules to make 'key is stop', but that would block the key, which is counterproductive. Or 'wall is win', but that's not helpful.

Wait, the current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So if I can change 'key is win' to 'baba is win', then just being Baba would satisfy the win condition. To do that, I need to move the text blocks 'baba', 'is', and 'win' into the correct positions.

The `baba` text block is at 2 left, 2 down. The `is` is at 1 left, 2 down. The `win` is at 8 right, 3 up. So to form 'baba is win', I need to move the `baba` to the right and up, the `is` to the right, and align them with the `win`.

But the distance is too great. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the `is` and `win` closer. For example, move the `is` one step right to be next to `win`, then move the `baba` next to `is`.

But how to move those text blocks? Let's consider the positions:

- `is` is at 7 right, 3 up.

- `win` is at 8 right, 3 up.

So `is` is one step left of `win`. To move `is` right by one step to 8 right, 3 up, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm Baba at (0,0), the `is` is at (7,3). To reach (7,3), I need to move right 7 steps and up 3 steps, but there are walls at 3 right, which blocks the path.

This seems impossible. Maybe another approach: Use the ball to create a path. The ball is at 5 right, 2 up. If I can move the ball down to 5 right, 1 up, which is the position of the key, but the key is at 5 right, 1 down. Not sure.

Alternatively, move the ball to block a wall. But I don't see how that helps.

Wait, the key is at 5 right, 1 down. If I can reach there, since key is win, that should work. But how to get past the walls. The path from my position (assuming 0,0) to 5 right, 1 down would be:

Right 5, Down 1. But there's a wall at 3 right, 3 up, which is not in the way. Wait, the walls are at various positions:

- wall at 3 right, 3 up

- wall at 3 right, 2 up

- wall at 3 right, 1 up

- wall at 3 right, 1 down

So moving right past 3 would hit these walls. Therefore, the path to 5 right is blocked by walls at 3 right. So I can't go directly right.

Alternative path: Move up first, then right around the walls. For example, move up to avoid the walls at 3 right. But the walls at 3 right are from up to down. So if I move up to 3 right, 4 up (but there's no info on the map beyond what's listed), but according to the observations, the walls at 3 right are up to 3 steps down. So maybe moving up past 3 right is possible.

Wait, the walls at 3 right are at 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, 1 down, 2 steps down, 3 steps down. So they form a vertical line at x=3 from y=1 up to y=3. So to go around them, I need to move left of x=3.

But my current position is at the `baba` rule, which is 2 left and 2 down. So my position is at (-2, -2) if we consider the `baba` rule's position. Then the `is` is at (-1, -2), and the `you` is at (0, -2). The key is at (5, -1). The ball is at (5, 0).

So to get to the key at (5, -1), I need to move right 7 steps and down 1 step from my current position (-2, -2). But the walls at x=3 block the path from x=3 to higher x values. So moving right past x=3 is blocked.

Therefore, I need to find a way to move around the walls at x=3. Maybe move up above them, then right, then down.

From (-2, -2), move up to (-2, 1), then right to (3,1), but there's a wall at x=3, y=1. So can't go there. Alternatively, move up further.

But according to the observations, the walls at x=3 are from y=1 up to y=3. So at y=4, x=3 is passable. So move up to y=4, then right past x=3.

But how high can I go? The map's upper limits aren't clear, but assuming there are no walls beyond y=3, I can move up.

So the plan:

1. Move up from (-2, -2) to (-2, 1), avoiding the wall at x=3, y=1.

Wait, no, moving up from (-2, -2) to (-2, 0), then (-2, 1), etc.

But there's a wall at x=3, y=3, but not necessarily Blocking movement upwards from lower y.

Assuming I can move up past y=3, then right past x=3.

But this is getting too vague. Maybe the best course is to focus on rearranging the rules to make 'baba is win'.

To do that, I need to move the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks into the correct positions.

The `win` is at (8,3). The `is` is at (7,3). So moving `is` right by one to (8,3) next to `win`. Then move `baba` to (7,3) next to `is`.

But how to move them? Since I'm at (-2,-2), I need to navigate to (7,3), which is far away, blocked by walls.

Alternative idea: Use the ball to push the text blocks. But the ball is at (5,0). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, move the `you` rule, which is at (0, -2). If I can move `you` to somewhere, but not sure how that helps.

This is really challenging. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to move right towards the key, even if blocked, but the walls are there. Alternatively, try to move the ball out of the way.

The ball is at (5,0). If I can move it down to (5,-1), which is where the key is. But the key is at (5,-1), which is the win position. If I can move the ball there, does that affect anything? Not sure, but maybe it creates a path.

To move the ball, I need to","

57,right,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out the best action to take in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current state based on the observation provided.

Active rules are:
- wall is stop: So any object labeled as 'wall' can't be moved through.
- key is win: So if I reach the key, it's considered a win.
- baba is you: Which means that the Baba object is the player, so I can control it.

Looking at the objects on the map, I need to locate Baba and the key. From the objects listed:
- There's a rule for 'baba' 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So the Baba object is probably at that position. Let me parse the positions.

The rules are in a specific format, so the positions are relative. Let's assume the player (Baba) is at a certain starting point. Since the rules mention 'baba' being 2 steps left and 2 steps down from a certain reference point, I need to figure out the grid layout. But maybe I can work with the given positions directly.

The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. I need to reach that key. However, there are walls blocking the path. The walls are either labeled as 'wall' or have a 'stop' rule. Since 'wall is stop' is active, any object that is a wall can't be passed through.

So the path to the key seems blocked by walls. Let me check the path:

From the key's position (5 right, 1 down), looking up, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the key is at 5 right, 1 down. So moving up from the key would take me to 5 right, 0 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Hmm, maybe the key is below a wall. Let me visualize:

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position defined by the 'baba' rule: 2 left and 2 down. So if I consider that position as (0,0), then:

- rule `baba` is at (-2, -2)
- The 'is' rule is at (-1, -2)
- 'you' is at (0, -2)

Then the wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up would be at (3,3). But the key is at (5,1). There's a wall at (3,1) (3 right, 1 up). So the path from Baba's position to the key is blocked by walls. 

The ball is at (5,2), which is adjacent to the key but also blocked by walls. The rule `ball` is at (2, right), which might be a movable text block. Oh, right! The 'rule ball' is a text block that can be moved if it's not defined as stop. Since the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you, the 'ball' itself isn't stopped unless specified. But the 'rule ball' is a text block that says ""BALL IS ..."", so maybe it's movable.

The key is a win condition, so reaching it would solve the level. But how to get past the walls? The walls are either 'wall' objects or have 'stop' properties. The 'wall' objects are at various positions. The 'rule stop' is at 3 step up, so the text block ""STOP"" is there, making any object that is stop immovable. But since the active rule is ""wall is stop"", any object labeled 'wall' is considered stop. So moving a 'wall' object is impossible.

Looking at the objects, the rule `wall` is at 2 left and 3 up. So the text ""WALL IS STOP"" is there. The actual wall objects are at positions like 3 right, 3 up; 3 right, 2 up; etc. These are the physical walls blocking the path.

So the challenge is to navigate around the walls to get to the key. Alternatively, maybe we can manipulate the rules to change the behavior of objects, allowing us to pass through walls or turn the key into a different object.

Since the key is the win condition, perhaps if we can make the key not be a win, but then another object becomes win. But the current active rule is ""key is win"", so unless we can remove or change that rule, touching the key would end the game as a win. Wait, but in Baba Is You, usually touching the win object (like a flag or key) wins the level. So if the key is win, then reaching it should solve the level. But the problem is getting past the walls.

Alternatively, maybe we can push the key towards us? But the key might be blocked by walls. Let's see the positions:

Key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. To the left of the key (4 right, 1 down) there's a wall. So the key is adjacent to a wall on its left. So perhaps the key can't be moved unless we remove the wall or the stop rule.

Another approach: Maybe we can change the 'wall is stop' rule. If we can move the ""WALL IS STOP"" text block and recombine them to create a new rule. For example, making ""STOP IS PUSH"" or something else. But to do that, we need to move the relevant text blocks.

The rule `wall` is at 2 left and 3 up. The rule `is` is at 1 left and 3 up. The rule `stop` is at 3 step up. So if we can move the ""STOP"" text block away, perhaps we can redefine the 'wall' property.

But to move any text block, the object it's on must not be 'stop'. The 'wall' objects are 'stop', so we can't push them. However, the text blocks like ""WALL"", ""IS"", ""STOP"" are on separate rule objects. For example, the rule `wall` is a text block on a rule object, and that rule object's position is 2 left and 3 up. Since the rule object itself isn't a wall unless specified, maybe we can move it.

Wait, the rule objects are separate from the objects they define. So the rule `wall` is a text block on a rule object, which is at 2 left and 3 up. That rule object's position is independent of its text. So if that rule object isn't blocked by a 'stop' rule, we can move it. Let's check if the rule object for 'wall' is blocked.

The rule object for 'wall' is at 2 left and 3 up. Are there any 'stop' rules affecting that position? The active rule is 'wall is stop', which means any object labeled 'wall' is stop. But the rule object itself isn't a wall unless the text says so. Since the text on the rule object is ""WALL IS STOP"", the rule object's own properties depend on other rules. Since there's no rule saying that rule objects are stop, they might be movable.

So perhaps we can move the ""WALL IS STOP"" text block to a different position, thereby changing the rules. For example, moving the ""STOP"" part to another part of the rule to create a new rule like ""WALL IS YOU"", which would make walls controllable.

But to do that, we need to move the individual text blocks. The rule is composed of three parts: ""WALL"", ""IS"", ""STOP"". If we can separate them and rearrange, we could create new rules.

Looking at the current setup:

- The rule `wall` is at 2 left, 3 up: This is the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. The components are:
  - ""WALL"" at 2 left, 3 up
  - ""IS"" at 1 left, 3 up
  - ""STOP"" at 3 step up (same row as the others?)

Wait, the observation lists the rule `wall` at 2 left 3 up, rule `is` at 1 left 3 up, and rule `stop` at 3 step up. So the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is spread out. The ""WALL"" text is at 2 left, 3 up; ""IS"" is at 1 left, 3 up; ""STOP"" is at 3 step up (which would be directly above the ""WALL"" text, maybe? If 3 step up from the original reference point.)

To recreate the rule, the ""IS"" must be between the subject and property. So ""WALL"" + ""IS"" + ""STOP"" forms the rule. If we can move these components to different positions, we can create new rules.

For example, if we take the ""STOP"" text block (which is a rule at 3 step up) and move it next to the ""WALL"" text, perhaps we can create a new rule like ""WALL IS [something else]"".

But how to move these text blocks? The player (Baba) is at the position defined by the 'baba' rule, which is 2 left and 2 down. Assuming that's the starting point, let's calculate the relative positions.

If Baba is at (0,0) (his position based on the 'baba' rule being 2 left and 2 down from some reference), then:

- rule `baba` is at (-2, -2)
- rule `is` is at (-1, -2)
- rule `you` is at (0, -2)
- The wall rule components:
  - ""WALL"" at (-2, 1) (2 left from (0,0), 3 up)
  - ""IS"" at (-1, 1) (1 left, 3 up)
  - ""STOP"" at (0, 2) (3 step up from (0,0))
  
The key is at (5, 1), which is far to the right and one down. The walls blocking the path are at (3,1) and others.

So the plan could be:

1. Move Baba to the position where he can interact with the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule's components.
2. Separate the ""STOP"" text block from the ""WALL IS"" part to redefine the rule.
3. Create a new rule that makes ""WALL"" not a stop, allowing movement through them.
4. Then navigate to the key.

But how to do this step by step?

First, locate Baba's position. The 'baba' rule is at (-2, -2), so assuming that's the starting point. From there, possible moves are up, down, left, right.

The ""WALL IS STOP"" rule components are at (-2,1), (-1,1), and (0,2). To reach them, Baba needs to move up and right. But moving right from (-2,-2) would take him to (-1,-2), then (0,-2), which is the 'you' rule. From there, moving up to (0,-1), etc. However, there might be walls blocking the way.

Wait, looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up, which would be (3,3) if Baba is at (0,0). But that's probably a distant wall. The immediate walls around Baba's starting area: at (3,1) which is to the right and one up. But if Baba is starting at (-2,-2), moving right to (0,-2) is possible, then up to (0,-1), then right to (1,-1), etc., but need to check for walls.

Alternatively, maybe the path is clear initially. Let's see:

From Baba's starting position (-2,-2):

- Moving right to (-1,-2): that's the 'is' rule, which is movable.
- Moving up to (-2,-1): is there a wall there? The walls listed are at positions like (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc., which are far to the right. So initially, movement might be possible.

The goal is to reach the ""STOP"" text block at (0,2). To get there, Baba needs to move up and right. Let's see the steps:

1. From (-2,-2), move right to (-1,-2) (the 'is' rule).
2. Move right again to (0,-2) (the 'you' rule).
3. Move up to (0,-1).
4. Move up to (0,0).
5. Move up to (0,1).
6. Move up to (0,2), where the ""STOP"" text block is.

But along the way, are there any walls blocking? The walls mentioned are at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc., which are far to the right. So moving up from (0,0) to (0,2) should be possible unless there's a wall in between. The observation doesn't mention walls in the upper left area, so maybe it's clear.

Once at (0,2), the ""STOP"" text block can be moved. If we can move it away, say to the left next to the ""WALL"" and ""IS"" parts, we could rewrite the rule.

For example, if we have ""WALL IS"" and then move ""STOP"" to another part, maybe creating ""WALL IS KEY"" or something else. But the key is the win condition, so that might not help. Alternatively, making ""STOP IS YOU"" so that stops are controllable.

But the main idea is to break the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. If we can separate ""STOP"" from the rule, then walls wouldn't be stops anymore, allowing movement through them.

So the steps could be:

- Move Baba to (0,2) to grab the ""STOP"" text block.
- Move ""STOP"" to a new position, say next to ""WALL"" and ""IS"" but rearranged to form a different rule, like ""WALL IS PUSH"" or ""STOP IS YOU"".

Once that's done, the walls would no longer be stops, and Baba could move through them to reach the key.

Alternatively, if we can create a rule that makes Baba a stop, but that would trap him. Not useful.

Another angle: The key is at (5,1). There's a ball at (5,2). The rule `ball` is at (2, right), which I think means the ""BALL IS ..."" rule is somewhere. If we can change the ball's rule to make it a stop or something else, maybe we can use the ball to push the key.

But the key is probably weight-sensitive. In some levels, you can push objects by standing next to them and moving in the same direction. If the key is blocked by a wall, maybe pushing the wall away would help, but walls are stops.

Alternatively, if we can make the wall not a stop, then we can move it.

So the core problem is to manipulate the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule. The solution likely involves moving the text blocks of that rule to change it.

Therefore, the plan is:

1. Move Baba to the position of the ""STOP"" text block (0,2).
2. Move the ""STOP"" block to a new location to break the ""WALL IS STOP"" rule.
3. Create a new rule that either removes the stop property from walls or redefines them.
4. Navigate to the key, now that walls aren't stops.

But how to execute this movement given the grid constraints?

Let me try to map out the movement:

Baba starts at (-2,-2).

To reach (0,2):

- Right to (-1,-2)
- Right to (0,-2)
- Up to (0,-1)
- Up to (0,0)
- Up to (0,1)
- Up to (0,2)

Each step is possible if there are no walls. Since the walls are all to the right (positions with x >=3), this path should be clear.

Once at (0,2), grab the ""STOP"" text block and move it. For example, move it left to (-1,2), next to the ""WALL"" and ""IS"" parts.

The original ""WALL IS STOP"" rule is formed by ""WALL"" (-2,1), ""IS"" (-1,1), ""STOP"" (0,2). If we move ""STOP"" to (-1,2), the rule would be ""WALL IS STOP"" broken, and now ""WALL IS"" is next to ""STOP"" at (-1,2), which might not form a valid rule unless rearranged.

Alternatively, move ""STOP"" to (-2,2), forming ""WALL IS STOP"" but in a different position. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move ""STOP"" to be between ""WALL"" and ""IS"", forming ""WALL STOP IS"", which is invalid. So the key is to separate them.

Maybe move ""STOP"" to a position where it doesn't connect to ""WALL IS"", effectively breaking the rule.

Once ""WALL IS STOP"" is broken, the ""wall"" objects no longer have the stop property. Then, Baba can move through them.

With that, the path to the key might be cleared. The key is at (5,1), blocked by a wall at (3,1). If walls are no longer stops, Baba can move right past them.

So after breaking the rule, the next step is to move right from Baba's current position (after manipulating the rules) towards the key.

But the question is, what's the first valid action to take? The observation shows that previous actions led to defaults due to invalid reasoning. So the assistant needs to output a valid action based on the current state.

In the latest observation, the player (Baba) is at the position defined by the 'baba' rule, which is 2 steps left and 2 steps down. The immediate task is to move towards the ""STOP"" text block to manipulate the rule.

The correct action would be to move up or right to reach the ""STOP"" block. But based on the positions, moving up from the initial position multiple times would get to the ""STOP"" block.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to move right to start the journey towards the rule components.

But considering the previous failures, the assistant needs to choose the correct initial action. Given the latest observation, the active rules and object positions, the best first action is to move right to get closer to the rule components.

Let's see. I'm Baba, and the goal is to get to the key which is the win condition. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move around unless there's a wall.

Looking at the map, I need to figure out the layout. Let me parse the objects:

There's a rule `wall` three steps to the left and three up. Then some other rules. The key is five steps to the right and three up. Wait, but I'm probably starting at Baba's position, which is three steps to the left and two steps down. Let me confirm:

Baba's position is given by the `rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down`. So if that rule is at, say, the origin (0,0), then Baba is at (-3, -2). But maybe the coordinate system is relative. Hmm, maybe I should visualize the map relative to Baba's position.

Let's try to sketch this out. The key is at (5,3), but considering the steps might be relative. Wait, the `rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up` is in the observation. So the key is located 6 steps right and 3 up from some reference point. But maybe the reference is the position of the 'is' rule next to it. For example, if `key is win` is a rule formed by the `rule `key`` being adjacent to `rule `is`` and `rule `win``, then the key is at 6 steps right and 3 up from the 'is' rule. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe all objects are positioned relative to Baba. Let's assume Baba is at the starting point. The `rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down` would place that text block 3 steps left and 2 down from Baba's position. So if Baba is at (0,0), the rule `baba` is at (-3, -2). Similarly, the `rule `is`` next to it would be at (-2, -2), and `rule `you`` at (-1, -2). Then, moving up from there, the walls and other rules are positioned.

But perhaps a better approach is to focus on movable objects. The key is at 6 steps right and 3 up from the `rule `key`` position. Wait, the `rule `key`` is 6 steps right and 3 up from where? Maybe from the previous rule. For example, if there's a chain of `rule `wall``, `rule `is``, then `rule `key``, each adjacent, then the key's position is relative to the 'is' rule. But without knowing the exact layout, it's tricky.

Alternatively, the key is somewhere in the upper right part of the map. There are walls blocking paths. The goal is to reach the key, which is defined as win. So moving towards the key, but avoiding walls.

Looking at the active rules: key is win, so if I can get to the key, I win. But the key is at 6 steps right and 3 up from the `rule `key`` position. But where is that `rule `key`` located? According to the objects list, `rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up`—so that's 6 steps right and 3 up from some reference point. Maybe from the previous rule, which is `rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 3 step up`. Wait, no, the `rule `is`` is at 7 steps right and 3 up. So the `rule `key`` is at 6 steps right and 3 up, which would be to the left of the `rule `is`` and `rule `win``.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for movable objects. The `rule `ball`` is at 1 step to the right. If I can move that, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the 'ball is you' rule, but currently, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The ball has a rule `ball` 1 step to the right, which might be part of a 'ball is ...' rule. If I can move that rule to say 'ball is you', then I could become the ball and navigate past walls.

Alternatively, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down from the `rule `key`` position. Wait, the key object is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. The `rule `key`` is at 6 steps right and 3 up. So maybe the key is located at 5 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. Let me try to map this out.

Assuming Baba is at (0,0):

- `rule `baba`` is at (-3, -2)
- `rule `is`` is at (-2, -2)
- `rule `you`` is at (-1, -2)
- Then moving up, there's `wall` at (3,3), `rule `wall`` at (-3,3), etc. This is getting too vague. Maybe I should focus on the immediate area around Baba.

Baba's position is at (0,0). The `rule `baba`` text block is 3 steps left and 2 down from Baba, so that's (-3, -2). The `rule `is`` is 1 step to the left and 2 down from Baba, so (-1, -2). The `rule `you`` is at 2 steps left and 2 down, (-2, -2)? Wait, no, the observation says `rule `you` 2 steps down`. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is different. Each step could be in grid units.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out with Baba starting somewhere, and the objects positioned relative to each other. The key is to the upper right, but surrounded by walls. The `rule `ball`` is near the bottom right. Maybe moving towards the ball to create a new rule.

But the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So as Baba, I can move unless there's a wall. The walls are at various positions. Let's see:

- Walls at 3 steps right and 3 up, 2 steps right and 2 up, etc.

So to get to the key at 5 steps right and 3 up, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 up. So I need to go around. But how?

Alternatively, if I can change the rules. For example, if I can make 'ball is you', then I can turn into the ball and maybe pass through walls. The ball has a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule next to 'ball' and 'you', then I can create 'ball is you'.

The `rule `ball`` is at 1 step to the right. So if I move right, I can get to that rule. Then, if I can move it next to the 'ball' object and the 'you' rule, I can form the new rule.

So the plan would be:

1. Move right to reach the `rule `ball`` at 1 step right.
2. Then move the `rule `ball`` next to the 'ball' object and the 'you' rule to create 'ball is you'.
3. Now, as the ball, which might not be stopped by walls, I can go around to the key.

But first, I need to navigate to the `rule `ball``. Let's see where Baba is currently. The `rule `baba`` is at 3 steps left and 2 down from Baba. So if Baba is at (0,0), then the `rule `baba`` is at (-3, -2). The `rule `is`` is at (-2, -2), and `rule `you`` is at (-1, -2). Then moving up, there are walls at (3,3), (2,2), etc.

To reach the `rule `ball`` which is 1 step to the right, that would be position (1,0). But the path might be blocked. Let's check the objects around Baba.

Looking at the objects:

- wall at 3 steps right and 3 up (from where?), maybe that's not immediately nearby.
- ball at 5 steps right and 2 step up. So that's further away.
- key at 5 steps right and 1 step down.

The `rule `ball`` is at 1 step to the right. So if I move right once, I can get to that rule. But can I move right? Are there any walls in between?

Baba's current position is (0,0). Moving right once would take him to (1,0). Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects list, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 up, which is probably not in the immediate path. The walls near Baba might be at (3,3), but that's up and to the right. So moving right once should be possible, as there's no 'wall is stop' blocking that immediate step.

So the action would be to move right to grab the `rule `ball``. Once there, move it adjacent to the 'ball' object and the 'you' rule to create 'ball is you'.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which is currently the key. But I need to check the active rules first.

The active rules are: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, walls are stopping me, the key is the target to win, and since Baba is You, I can move around as Baba. 

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's also a wall blocking that path. Wait, the key is defined as win, so reaching it should make me win. But there's a wall in the way. How can I get past the wall?

The rules also mention a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. Maybe I can manipulate that. If I can change the rule so that ball is no longer a stop, or make myself a ball, maybe I can move through it. 

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can create a new rule that makes me immune to stop. For example, if I can make ""baba is not stop"" or ""you is not stop"". But to do that, I need to move the 'is' text block and rearrange the rules.

Looking at the positions, the rule `you` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. The rule `baba` is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. If I can move the 'baba is you' rule somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule that changes my properties.

Wait, the rule `ball` is at 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule next to 'baba' and 'is', maybe I can create ""baba is ball"" or something. But I need to see if that's possible. 

First, I need to move myself (Baba) to a position where I can interact with the text blocks. Let me check where Baba is located. The observation doesn't explicitly state Baba's position, but there's a rule `baba` at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Maybe that's where I am? Or is that a separate object? Wait, the objects include ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"", which is a text block, not Baba himself. So, Baba must be somewhere else. 

Assuming Baba is at the position of the 'you' rule, which is 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. But the active rule says ""baba is you"", so perhaps Baba is at that position. Let me confirm: the 'you' rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down, and the 'baba' rule is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe Baba is at the position of the 'you' rule? Or maybe he's elsewhere. 

Alternatively, maybe the player (Baba) is at a different location. Since the problem doesn't specify, I might need to infer based on typical levels. Often, Baba starts in a position where he can reach the 'is' text blocks to create new rules. 

Looking at the current setup, there's a key at 5 steps right and 1 step down, blocked by a wall. To get past the wall, I need to either remove the 'wall is stop' rule, make the wall not a stop, or create a way to move through it. 

Since 'wall is stop' is an active rule, if I can break that rule by moving the text blocks. For example, moving 'wall' to another position, or changing 'is' to something else. 

The 'ball' rule is at 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule next to 'wall' and 'is', maybe I can create a rule like 'wall is ball', which would make walls act like balls, which are not stops. But I need to see if that's possible. 

Alternatively, if I can make myself (Baba) a ball by creating 'baba is ball', then since balls are not stops, I could move through walls. But how to do that? 

Let me outline the steps:

1. Move to the location of the 'is' text block to manipulate rules.
2. Move the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is' to create 'wall is ball'.
3. Now, walls are balls, which are not stops, so I can walk through them.
4. Go around the wall to reach the key.

But first, I need to navigate to the correct position. The current position of Baba is probably near the 'you' rule at 1 step left and 2 steps down. From there, maybe moving right to get to the 'is' blocks. 

Looking at the map structure, the 'is' blocks are at various positions. The key is to the right and down. If I move right, I can reach the area with the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. 

Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. So from my current position (assuming I'm at 1 step left and 2 steps down), moving right multiple times. Let's see:

Current position: 1 step left, 2 steps down (where 'you' is).
To get to the key at 5 steps right, 1 step down, I need to move right 6 times and down 1 time. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the walls are at various positions, but the key is down from the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a path around the wall. If I can make the walls act like balls, then I can walk through them. 

So, the plan is:

- Move to the area where the 'wall' rule, 'is' rule, and 'ball' rule are located.
- rearrange them to create 'wall is ball'.
- Then proceed through the wall.

To do that, I need to move the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is'. The 'ball' rule is currently at 1 step to the right. So from my current position (1 left, 2 down), moving right to get to the 'ball' rule. 

But the 'ball' rule is 1 step to the right. So moving right once would get me there. Then, move the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' (which is at 3 left, 3 up) and 'is' (2 left, 3 up). Wait, the 'wall' rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps up. The 'is' rule is 1 step left and 3 steps up. So to create 'wall is ball', I need to bring 'ball' next to 'wall' and 'is'. 

But 'wall' is at 2 left, 3 up. 'is' is at 1 left, 3 up. So if I move the 'ball' rule from 1 right to between them, maybe at 2 left, 3 up? 

But how to move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba, and I can move objects that are not stop. Currently, walls are stop, but other objects like text blocks (rules) might not be stop unless specified. Wait, the active rule says 'wall is stop', but other objects like 'rule `ball`'—are they stop? The rules don't say, so they might be movable. 

So, I can move the 'ball' rule. Let's say I'm at position of 'you' (1 left, 2 down). To get to the 'ball' rule at 1 right, I need to move right once. Then, from there, move up to the 'is' and 'wall' rules. 

Once I have the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is', I can create the new rule 'wall is ball', making walls passable. 

After that, go around the walls to reach the key. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a faster way. If I can make myself a win by changing the 'win' rule. But that's Probably harder. 

So step by step:

1. Move right to reach the 'ball' rule.
2. Move up to the 'is' and 'wall' rules.
3. Rearrange them to create 'wall is ball'.
4. Move through the wall to the key.

But I need to check the exact positions. Let me map this out.

Current positions:

- 'ball' rule: 1 step to the right (so from my current position at 1 left, 2 down, moving right once gets me to 0 left, 2 down. But the 'ball' rule is at 1 step to the right, which would be position (assuming Baba is at 0,0), but this might be confusing without a coordinate system. 

Alternatively, the map is described with relative positions. For example, 'rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up' means that the wall rule is located 2 steps to the left and 3 steps up from some reference point, probably Baba's position. 

Assuming Baba is at the position of the 'you' rule (1 step left, 2 steps down), then moving right would take him towards the 'ball' rule. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of grid movement. Let's assume Baba is at a certain grid coordinate, and the other objects are relative to him. For example, if Baba is at (0,0), then:

- 'rule `wall`' is at (-2, 3)
- 'rule `is`' is at (-1, 3)
- 'rule `stop`' is at (1, 3)
- wall is at (2, 3)
- etc.

But this is getting complicated. Let's try to visualize the map based on the observations.

Another approach: The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. There's a wall blocking the path. To get past the wall, change its property. The 'ball' rule is nearby. So moving the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is' to create 'wall is ball'.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the location of the 'is' rule (which is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba's position? Not sure).
2. Bring the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is' to form 'wall is ball'.
3. Now, walls are balls, so they can be passed.
4. Move around the wall to the key.

Assuming Baba can move freely to those areas, the steps would involve moving right, up, and rearranging the text blocks.

But each action has to be a single move (up, down, left, right, or idle). So perhaps the first move is to go right to reach the 'ball' rule, then move up to the 'is' and 'wall' rules.

Alternatively, if I'm already near the 'is' rule, maybe I can rearrange them. 

Wait, the active rules are 'wall is stop', 'key is win', 'baba is you'. The objects include the 'rule `ball`' at 1 step to the right. So, if I can move that 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is', I can create 'wall is ball'.

To do that, from my current position (assuming it's near the 'you' rule), I need to move right to get to the 'ball' rule. Then move up to the 'is' and 'wall' rules which are up at 3 steps up.

So, first action: move right once to reach the 'ball' rule.

Then, move up to get to the 'is' and 'wall' rules which are at 3 steps up.

Once there, I can push the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is' to create the new rule.

But each move is a single step, so I need to navigate carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' rule next to 'wall' and 'ball' to form the new rule.

But this requires careful movement.

Alternatively, since the 'key is win' rule is already active, maybe I can just reach the key by moving around. But the wall is in the way.

Another angle: The 'rule `ball`' is at 1 step to the right. If I can make 'baba is ball', then since balls are not stops, I can move through walls. To do that, I need to create the rule 'baba is ball'.

The existing 'baba' rule is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. The 'is' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. The 'ball' rule is at 1 step right.

So, if I can move the 'baba' rule, 'is' rule, and 'ball' rule together to form 'baba is ball'.

But how? Each move can only move one text block at a time, I think.

So, steps:

1. Move to the position of the 'is' rule (2 steps left, 3 steps up).
2. Move the 'ball' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is' to form 'baba is ball'.

But this requires precise movements.

Alternatively, if I can push the 'baba' rule to the right and 'is' rule accordingly.

This is getting a bit complex. Maybe the easiest way is to first get to the 'ball' rule, then move up to the 'is' and 'wall' rules, and rearrange them.

So, first action: move right to get to the 'ball' rule.

Then, move up to the 'is' and 'wall' area.

Once there, move the 'ball' rule next to 'wall' and 'is' to create 'wall is ball'.

After that, walk through the wall to the key.

But how to represent this in single actions? Each action is a single step, so I need to sequence the moves.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is simpler. Since the key is a win, and it's defined as 'key is win', maybe I can just reach the key by moving right past the walls. But the walls are stops, so I can't.

Wait, but if I can change the 'key is win' rule to something else, but that might not help. Or maybe create a new rule that makes the key not a stop.

Alternatively, if I can make myself a key, then since I'm you, I would be a key, which is win. So 'baba is key', which would make me win. 

To do that, I need to create the rule 'baba is key'. The existing 'key' rule is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. The 'is' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. So, if I can move the 'key' and 'is' rules next to the 'baba' rule.

The 'baba' rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So moving right to get to the 'key' and 'is' rules.

This might be possible.

So steps:

1. Move right multiple times to reach the area with the 'key' rule.
2. Rearrange the 'baba', 'is', and 'key' rules to form 'baba is key'.
3. Now, since I'm baba and key is win, I would win by touching the key (or just by existing as key).

But how to move the text blocks.

Alternatively, since I'm already 'you', if I can make 'you is win', but that's redundant because 'key is win' is already active.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to focus on one possible solution.

Another approach: The 'rule `ball`' is at 1 step to the right. If I can create the rule 'ball is win', then touching a ball would make me win. But the key is already win. Not sure.

Alternatively, create 'ball is you', then move as a ball. But I'm already you.

Wait, 'baba is you', so I'm you. If I make 'ball is you', then balls are also you. So I can push balls or move through them. But how does that help?

Alternatively, make 'stop is nothing' to remove the stop property from walls. But to do that, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule.

To break a rule, you have to move the text blocks apart. For example, if the rule is 'wall is stop', you can move 'wall' or 'stop' away.

So, if I can move the 'wall' text block away from the 'is' and 'stop' text blocks, then the rule 'wall is stop' would be broken.

But the 'wall' rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up. The 'is' rule is at 1 step left and 3 steps up. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up (wait, looking back: the objects list has 'rule `stop` 3 step up'—Wait, no. Let me check the observation again.

In the current observation, the objects are:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- etc.

Wait, the 'rule `stop`' is at 3 step up, not positioned relative to left or right. So it's directly above, 3 steps up from Baba's position.

So the 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the 'wall' rule at 2 left, 3 up; 'is' at 1 left, 3 up; 'stop' at 3 up (but not left or right, so maybe centered? Or perhaps it's a different coordinate system).

This is getting too confusing without a visual map. Let's try to think differently.

The key is at 5 right, 1 down. There's a wall at 3 right, 1 up. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall. To get past, either remove the wall's stop property or make myself not stop.

Since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', if I can change 'you' to not be stop. Or create a rule like 'you is not stop'.

But to create that, I need to move the 'you' rule and rearrange it with 'not stop'.

But there's no 'not' rule in the current active rules. So that's not possible unless we can create a negation. But Baba Is You doesn't typically allow negation unless there's a 'not' text block. Since there isn't one here, maybe that's not the way.

Looking at the map objects, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's a wall two steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, no, let me check again. The walls are in various positions. The rule 'ball' is 1 step to the right. Hmm. The ball is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. The key is down at 4 right and 1 down. 

I need to move towards the key. But how? The current position of Baba is probably not specified here. Wait, the objects list doesn't mention Baba's position directly. Wait, there's a rule `baba` at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So that's Baba's position. Let me parse that.

So, Baba is at 3 left and 2 down from where? Assuming the reference point is the player's current position? Wait, maybe the map is relative. But this is getting confusing. Let me try to visualize.

The rules are spread around. The wall rules are three steps left and three up, then two steps left and three up, etc. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 up, but then there's a rule 'key' at 6 steps right and 3 up. Wait, maybe the key is at 6 steps right, 3 up. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right, 3 up. 

But the key's position is also listed as 5 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, there's a key at 5 right, 1 down. And another key at 4 right, 1 down. Wait, no, looking back: ""key 4 steps to the right and 1 step down"". So the key is at 4 right, 1 down. That's the win location. So the goal is to reach that key.

But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's see. From Baba's position at 3 left and 2 down, moving right would bring me closer. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 up. Wait, maybe the walls are above. Let me try to map this out.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 steps right, 1 down, which is directly below the current position? Wait, if Baba is at 3 left and 2 down, then moving right would be towards positive steps. The key is at 4 right and 1 down. So from Baba's position, moving right steps would be towards the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to move right to reach the key. Let's see. If I move right, I can go towards the key's location. But need to check if there are any STOP properties in the way. The walls are STOP, but if I can move past them by changing rules.

Wait, the rule 'ball' is at 1 step to the right. Maybe I can move that rule to create a new rule. For example, if I move 'ball is you' or something. But I need to see if I can manipulate the text blocks.

Wait, the current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So if I can create a new rule like 'key is stop', that might block me, but maybe not. Alternatively, if I can make 'you' a different object, like 'key is you', then I could become the key and walk over walls.

But how to do that? To create a new rule, I need to move a 'you' text block next to an object. The 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that 'you' rule to the key's position, then maybe I can set key as you.

Alternatively, the ball is at 4 right and 2 up, and there's a rule 'ball' at 1 step right. If I can move the 'ball' rule next to the ball, then perhaps create 'ball is you' or 'ball is win', but the goal is to reach the key.

Wait, the key is the win condition. So if I can get to the key, which is already defined as win, then that's the goal. But the key is at 4 right and 1 down. So from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), moving right three steps would get to 0 steps left/right, and then down one step. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe moving down towards the key. Let's see. If I move down from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down) to 3 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, moving right towards the key. Let's count steps. If I move right once, I'm at 2 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 left, 2 down. Then right again to 0 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 right, 2 down. Then down once to 1 right, 3 down. But that's a wall. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. So maybe the path is right, right, right, down. But need to avoid walls. Let's see:

From Baba's position (assuming it's at 0,0 for simplicity, but the actual coordinates are relative to the rules). This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move right towards the key's location, avoiding walls.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps up, but that's above. The walls below are at 3 steps right and 1 step up, 2 steps up, etc. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. So moving right four times would get there, but need to check if those steps are blocked.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 right, 1 down, which is directly one step down from 4 right, 2 up (the ball's position). So if I can move down from the ball's area, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move right until I'm at the key's position. Let's see: if I move right four times, I reach 4 right. Then down once. But between there, are there any STOP walls? The wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up is above, so moving down from 4 right would be okay. But the key is at 4 right and 1 down, so moving down from 4 right, 0 down (assuming current position is 3 left and 2 down, moving right three times gets to 0 left, 2 down, then right once to 1 right, 2 down, then down to 1 right, 3 down, which is a wall. So that's bad.

Alternatively, maybe I need to manipulate the rules. For example, create a rule that says 'key is you', making the key movable. Then I could move the key to myself. But how?

The 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move that 'you' rule next to the key, then I could write 'key is you', making the key a You object. Then I could move onto the key.

So the steps would be: move to the 'you' rule, then move it next to the key, combining them into 'key is you'. Then the key becomes movable, and I can pick it up and take it to the win condition.

But how to do that in actions? The available actions are up, down, left, right, idle. So I need to navigate to the 'you' rule's position, which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from Baba's current position. Then move the 'you' rule to the key's location.

Assuming Baba's position is at 3 left and 2 down, moving left once would get to 4 left, 2 down. Then down once to 4 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down, which is 3 steps right from where? This is getting too ambiguous without a visual map.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and then move it in a direction. But since I'm Baba, and can move unless stopped, I need to reach that 'you' rule.

So first, move left from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down) to reach the 'you' rule. Then, once next to it, move it towards the key. For example, move left to get to the 'you' rule, then move the rule right towards the key.

But how to represent that in actions? The problem is that the assistant can only output a single action (like up, down, left, right, or idle) per turn. So each step is a single move.

So the plan would be:

1. From Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), move left to reach the 'you' rule at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Wait, if Baba is at 3 left, 2 down, moving left once would take him to 4 left, 2 down. But the 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'you' rule is located at a position relative to the map. Maybe the player needs to move to the 'you' rule's location, pick it up, and move it next to the key.

Assuming that moving right and down is possible, the steps could be:

Move right to get closer to the key's area. Then, once at the 'you' rule's location, move the rule towards the key.

But each action is just a single step. So perhaps the solution is to move right repeatedly until reaching the key, but avoiding walls. Alternatively, find a way to make the key movable.

Another angle: since the key is already defined as 'win', reaching it would satisfy the win condition. But the path might be blocked by walls. So maybe the solution is to change the 'wall is stop' rule to something else, making walls passable.

To do that, I need to move the 'wall is stop' rule and change it. For example, move the 'stop' rule away and create 'wall is you' or similar. But that requires manipulating multiple text blocks.

Alternatively, create a rule that says 'stop is nothing', making walls not stop. But again, need to move the existing rules.

This is getting complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best immediate action is to keep moving right towards the key, hoping that the path is clear. Alternatively, move down to avoid walls.

But based on previous observations, when the assistant tried moving right multiple times, it got stuck. So maybe need to find a different path.

Alternatively, since the 'ball' has a rule at 1 step right, maybe moving that rule next to the ball to create a new rule. For example, 'ball is you', making the ball movable. Then push the ball over the key or something. But the key is the win condition, so perhaps just reaching it is enough.

Wait, the key is already a win, so if I can get to it, regardless of being Baba or not. But since Baba is You, I can move through anything unless it's a STOP. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. If I can move there without hitting a STOP.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 up, which is above the key area. Lower down, the walls are at 3 steps right and 1 up, 2 up, etc. The path to the key at 4 right, 1 down would need to go through 4 right, then down. But between there, are there any walls?

At 4 right, 2 step up: ball is there. No wall. At 4 right, 1 step up: wall? No, looking at the objects, the wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. So 4 right is one step further. So from 4 right, moving down from 2 step up to 1 step up is okay. Then down to 1 down, which is the key's location. But is there a wall at 4 right, 1 down? The objects list shows a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down, but that's not the same as 4 right.

So perhaps the path is clear. So moving right four times, then down once. But how to do that in steps.

But the assistant can only output one action per turn. So the best action now is to move right, as previous attempts got stuck, maybe because the path was blocked. But according to the current observation, after moving right a few times, the position might have changed.

Alternatively, check the latest observation. In the last observation, after several right moves, the objects' positions have shifted. For example, the rule 'wall' is now 3 steps left and 3 steps up, which might mean that the player has moved right, causing the map to shift.

This is quite confusing without a visual layout. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with moving right again, as it seems to be the direction towards the key.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You problem. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is a key in this case. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm controlled by the Baba object because of ""baba is you"". The walls are stop, meaning I can't move into them.

Looking at the map, there's a key located at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Wait, no, let me check the objects again. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up? Wait, the key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up from where? The current position of Baba might be important here. But since the observation doesn't specify Baba's position directly, maybe I need to infer it from the rules. The rule ""baba is you"" is at 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe Baba's original position is at that rule's location? Or is the rule itself separate?

Wait, the objects listed include the rule blocks. So the rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the current position? Hmm, perhaps the map is laid out with Baba's position being determined by where the ""baba"" text block is. But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me map out the positions.

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The objects on the map include several walls, keys, and rules. Let's parse each object's position relative to the current position (assuming the current position is the starting point).

For example, the rule `wall` is 3 steps to the left and 3 steps up. So if I'm at (0,0), this rule is at (-3, 3). Similarly, rule `is` is 1 step left and 3 up, so (-1,3). The wall at 2 steps right and 3 up would be (2,3). Continuing this, the key is at (5,3), rule `is` at (6,3), rule `win` at (7,3). Then there are walls and the ball down at lower steps.

The rule `baba` is at (-3, -2), which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from the current position. The rule `is` is at (-2, -2), and `you` is at (-1, -2). So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed by the `baba` text block at (-3,-2), `is` at (-2,-2), and `you` at (-1,-2).

Now, my goal is to get to the key, which is at (5,3). But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see the layout:

From the current position (assuming it's at (0,0)), moving up to (0,1) is a wall. Moving right to (1,0) is a wall. The key is at (5,3), but there's a wall at (2,3), (3,3), etc. Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, which is (5,3). But between me and the key, there's a wall at (2,3), another at (3,3), and so on. So I can't go straight up.

Looking at the ball at (4,2), which is 4 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a rule `ball` at (1, right), which might mean the rule is 1 step to the right from the current position. So maybe that rule allows the ball to have certain properties? Not sure yet.

The rule `ball` is at (1, right) — perhaps 1 step to the right from the current position. So if I can move that rule, maybe I can change the ball's property. For example, if I make ""ball is you"", then I could move the ball to reach the key. Alternatively, if I can make ""key is stop"", then the key becomes a wall, but that might not help.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the key is the win condition. To win, I need to touch the key. The problem is that there's a wall at (2,3) blocking the straight path. How can I get past that?

Possible actions:

1. Move the rule blocks to create new rules. For example, take the ""stop"" rule and move it somewhere else to remove the wall property from a wall. Or take the ""win"" rule and move it to a different object, changing what's win.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 3 steps up. If I can move that rule to a different location, maybe I can make a wall not stop. But how? To move a rule, I need to be next to it and it's not defined as STOP. The current rules have wall is stop, so any object with STOP property can't be moved. Wait, the tip says: ""You can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar immovable properties.""

So, which objects are STOP? The wall is stop, so the wall objects are STOP. But the rule blocks themselves, like `wall`, `is`, `stop`, etc., are they movable? The rules are text blocks, so unless they have a STOP property, they can be moved. The active rule is ""wall is stop"", which means any object named wall has the stop property. The rule blocks themselves (like `wall`, `is`, `stop`) are not walls, so they might be movable unless another rule says they're stop.

So, the rule `stop` at 3 steps up is a text block. Since the only STOP property is on walls, the rule `stop` can be moved. Similarly, the `ball` rule at 1 step right can be moved.

So, the plan is to move the `key is win` rule to make the key not a win, allowing us to path through, or move the `wall is stop` rule to remove the stop property from a wall, allowing us to move through it. Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba have the ability to move through walls by redefining stop.

But how?

Option 1: Change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is not stop"". To do that, we need to move the `stop` rule away from the `wall` rule. The current setup is:

rule `wall` 3 step left 3 up

rule `is` 1 step left 3 up

rule `stop` 3 step up

So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by `wall` at (-3,3), `is` at (-1,3), and `stop` at (0,3). If we can move the `stop` rule, say, down to attach it to something else, we could change the rule. For example, move `stop` to attach to `baba`, making ""baba is stop"", which would block us. Not helpful. Alternatively, move `stop` to attach to `key`, making ""key is stop"", but the key is already win. Hmm.

Option 2: Create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. Since ""wall is stop"" is a rule, if we can change that to ""wall is not stop"", then walls wouldn't block us. To do that, we need to rearrange the existing rules. The current ""wall is stop"" is made by `wall` (-3,3), `is` (-1,3), `stop` (0,3). If we can move the `stop` text block to a different position, say, next to `baba`, then we could create a new rule like ""baba is stop"", but that's bad. Alternatively, move `is` or `wall` to change the rule.

Alternatively, take the `is` from the ""wall is stop"" rule and use it elsewhere. For example, if we can move the `is` to connect `baba` with `win`, making ""baba is win"", which would mean touching Baba makes you win. But then you don't need to touch the key. But the goal is usually to touch the win object, which is the key. So if we make ""baba is win"", then just standing on Baba would make you win. But I'm not sure if that's possible here.

Wait, the current rules are ""baba is you"", so you control Baba. If we can make ""baba is win"", then since you are Baba, you would be win, so touching the key might not be necessary. But I need to check if that's a valid action.

Alternatively, create a rule ""you is win"", but the current ""you"" rule is part of ""baba is you"". The ""baba is you"" rule is at (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2). So the `you` is at (-1,-2). If we can move the `you` text block, we could attach it to something else. For example, move `you` to the key, making ""key is you"", so moving the key would make you win. But the key is at (5,3), which is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, move the `win` rule from (7,3) to attach to Baba. For example, move `win` to be next to `baba`, making ""baba is win"". Then, since you are Baba (from ""baba is you""), you would automatically be win, so touching anything might not be necessary. But I'm not sure if the game considers being the win condition as winning immediately. Sometimes you have to touch the win object, but maybe not always.

Another approach: Use the ball. There's a ball at (4,2) and a rule `ball` at (1, right). If we can make ""ball is you"", then we could move the ball to reach the key. Let's see. The rule `ball` is at (1, right), which is 1 step to the right from the current position. To make ""ball is you"", we need to have `ball`, `is`, and `you` in a line. The current `you` is at (-1,-2). So if we can move the `you` to be next to `ball` and `is`, we could create ""ball is you"".

So the steps might be:

1. Move the `ball` rule from (1, right) to somewhere.
2. Move the `is` rule from its current position (6,3) to adjacent to `ball`.
3. Move the `you` rule from (-1,-2) to the end of that line.

But how to do this given the movements?

Alternatively, since the `you` is at (-1,-2), which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the current position, maybe I can move right to get to the `ball` rule at (1, right). Wait, the current position is probably where the ""baba is you"" rule is, but I'm not sure. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual, but let's try to reason.

Assuming my current position is at (0,0), and the ""baba is you"" rule is at (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2). So to move towards the `ball` rule at (1, right) (which is (1,0)), I need to move right. But there's a wall at (2,0). So I can't go right directly. Hmm.

Wait, the wall at (2,0) is part of the STOP walls. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", and walls are stop, I can't move into them. So I'm blocked from moving right past (2,0). How can I get past that?

Maybe by redefining the wall's stop property. If I can move the `stop` rule away from the `wall` rule, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Let's see where the `stop` rule is. It's at (0,3), which is 3 steps up from the current position (0,0). The ""wall is stop"" rule is made by `wall` at (-3,3), `is` at (-1,3), and `stop` at (0,3). So to break this rule, I need to move one of these components.

If I can move the `stop` rule from (0,3) to another position, say, next to `baba`, then I could create a new rule like ""baba is stop"", which would be bad, or ""stop is you"", but not helpful. Alternatively, move the `is` from (-1,3) to elsewhere. For example, move `is` down to connect with `baba` and `win`.

Alternatively, take the `key is win` rule, which is at (5,3), (6,3), (7,3). If I can move the `win` part to attach to a different object, like the ball, making ""ball is win"". Then the ball would be the win object, which is at (4,2). But I need to reach the ball to touch it, but there's a wall at (2,3) and others blocking the way.

This is quite complex. Let's think step by step.

First, identify all movable objects. The rule blocks: `wall`, `is`, `stop`, `key`, `win`, `ball`, and `you` (since walls are stop, but the rule blocks themselves aren't walls unless specified). So all the text blocks like `wall`, `is`, etc., can be moved unless they are part of a STOP object.

So the plan is to move these text blocks to create new rules.

Goal: Either make a path to the key by removing wall's stop property, or create a new win condition that's reachable.

Option 1: Remove ""wall is stop"" by moving the `stop` rule.

The current ""wall is stop"" is composed of `wall` (-3,3), `is` (-1,3), `stop` (0,3). If we can move the `stop` rule away, say, down to attach to `baba`, making ""baba is stop"", but that would make Baba a stop, preventing movement. Not good.

Alternatively, move `is` from (-1,3) to a different position. For example, move `is` to connect `baba` with `win`, making ""baba is win"". Then, since you are Baba, touching anything would make you win. But how to do that?

The `is` is at (-1,3). To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and not have a STOP property. The area around (-1,3) has walls at (2,3) and others. Maybe move `is` down to the ""baba is you"" rule area.

The ""baba is you"" rule is at (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2). The `you` is at (-1,-2). If I can move the `is` from (-1,3) to (-2,-2), then combine it with `baba` at (-3,-2) and `you` at (-1,-2), forming ""baba is you"" again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move `is` to connect `baba` with `win`. The `win` is at (7,3). To get there, I need to move down from (0,3) to (7,3), but there are walls in the way.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe another approach.

Option 2: Make ""key is you"" so that moving the key would make you win. To do this, need to have `key`, `is`, `you` in a line.

The `key` is at (5,3), `is` is at (6,3), `you` is at (-1,-2). To create ""key is you"", need to move the `you` to be next to `key` and `is`. But the `you` is at (-1,-2), which is far from the key. How to get there?

First, move the `you` rule. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. The `you` is at (-1,-2), which is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the current position (0,0). So from (0,0), I can move left to (-1,0), but there's a wall at (-1,0) (since wall is at (-1,3) up, but down there might be walls as well). Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check the map again.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 3 steps to the left and 3 step up: (-3,3)
- rule `is` 1 step left and 3 up: (-1,3)
- rule `stop` 3 step up: (0,3)
- wall 2 steps right and 3 up: (2,3)
- rule `key` 5 right, 3 up: (5,3)
- etc.

Downwards:

- wall 2 steps right: (2,0)
- ball 4 right, 2 up: (4,2)
- wall 2 right, 1 up: (2,1)
- rule `ball` 1 step right: (1,0)
- wall 2 right: (2,0)
- key 4 right, 1 down: (4,-1)
- rule `baba` 3 left, 2 down: (-3,-2)
- rule `is` 2 left, 2 down: (-2,-2)
- rule `you` 2 down: (-1,-2)
- walls further down.

So from (0,0), moving left to (-1,0) is possible? There's a wall at (-3,3) up, but down there at (-1,0), is there a wall? The objects listed don't show a wall at (-1,0), so maybe it's free. But I need to confirm.

The objects listed are:

- wall at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3)
- ball at (4,2)
- key at (5,3), (4,-1)
- rules at various positions.

So from (0,0), moving left to (-1,0) is possible. Then move down to (-1,-1), (-1,-2) where the `you` rule is. But to move to (-1,-1), is there a wall? The map doesn't show a wall there, so probably can.

So the steps could be:

1. Move from (0,0) left to (-1,0).
2. Move down to (-1,-1).
3. Move down","

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I can move around unless there's a wall. The goal is to get the key, which is defined as win, so grabbing the key should make me win.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. But how do I get there? There's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, and some other walls blocking the path. Wait, but maybe I can rearrange the rules to bypass them.

There's a rule 'ball is' at 1 step to the right. If I can move that 'ball is' text block, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I make 'ball' a STOP or something else. But first, I need to see if I can reach the text blocks.

I'm currently positioned at the rule 'baba' which is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the player's position isn't explicitly listed here. Hmm, maybe I need to infer my position based on the objects. The rule 'baba' is at 3 left, 2 down. So perhaps I'm next to that? Or maybe I'm at the position of the 'you' rule? Since baba is you, I should be at the 'baba' rule or adjacent to it.

Assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's position (3 left, 2 down), moving right would take me towards the other rules. Let's see: if I move right once, I'm at the 'is' rule (2 left, 2 down). Then right again to the 'you' rule (1 left, 2 down). Then right again, but there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So I can't go further right directly. Maybe I need to move down instead?

Looking at the map, moving down from the 'you' rule (1 left, 2 down) would take me to 1 left, 3 down, which is a wall. So that's blocked. How about up? From the 'you' rule, moving up would take me back to the 'baba is you' rules above. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the text blocks to change the rules. The 'ball is' rule is at 1 step to the right. If I can move that 'ball is' to create a new rule, like 'ball is YOU', then I could become a ball and potentially pass through walls. But how do I move the 'ball is' text block? It needs to not be STOP. Current rules say wall is stop, but the 'ball is' rule itself isn't a stop, so maybe I can move it.

To move the 'ball is' rule, I need to be adjacent to it. If I'm at the 'you' rule (1 step left, 2 down), moving right twice would get me to the 'ball is' rule at 1 step right. Wait, the 'ball is' rule is 1 step to the right. So from my current position (assuming I'm at 'you' which is 1 left, 2 down), moving right once would place me at 1 left - 1 step right = same horizontal? Wait, maybe the directions are a bit confusing. Let me clarify:

The positions are given as steps relative to the player's current location. For example, 'rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 3 step up' means that rule is 3 steps left and 3 up from where I am. So if I want to move towards it, I'd need to go left 3 times and up 3 times. But that's probably not efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from some origin point. But this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to sketch a mental map.

Let's assume the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So the 'baba' rule is located there. Then, the other rules and objects are positioned relative to this point.

- 'is' is 2 steps left and 3 up from the 'baba' rule.
- 'stop' is 1 step left and 3 up.
- Wall is 2 steps right and 3 up.
- Key is 5 steps right and 3 up.
- Etc.

So the map is laid out in a grid with Baba starting at (3 left, 2 down). The key is far to the right up high. To reach it, I need to navigate around the walls. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 steps right, 3 up; 2 steps right, 2 up; etc.

The key is at 5 right, 3 up. So from Baba's starting position (3 left, 2 down), to get to the key, I need to move right 8 steps and up 5 steps. But there are walls in the way. For example, at 2 steps right and 3 up there's a wall. So maybe I can remove that wall's rule.

The 'wall is stop' rule is active, so if I can change 'wall is stop' to something else, like 'wall is' (which would remove the stop property), then walls become passable. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall is' text block.

The 'wall is' rule is located 3 steps left and 3 steps up from Baba. So to reach it, I need to move left 3 and up 3. But that's going away from the key. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, the 'ball is' rule is at 1 step right. If I can move that to create a new rule, like 'key is you', which would make the key become the player. Then I could grab the key without moving through walls. But how?

Wait, the current rules are:

- wall is stop
- key is win
- baba is you

If I can create a rule 'key is you', then since key is win, that would make me win by touching the key. But how to create that rule? There's a 'key' rule at 5 steps right and 3 up, which is part of 'key is win'. To change 'key is win' to 'key is you', I need to move the 'is win' text blocks.

Alternatively, there's a spare 'is' rule at 6 steps right and 3 up (part of 'key is win'), and another 'is' at 2 steps left and 3 up. Maybe I can rearrange these.

But to move any text blocks, I need to be adjacent to them and they can't be STOP. The 'ball is' rule is at 1 step right, which is not a stop, so I can move it. If I move 'ball is' to somewhere else, maybe I can form a new rule like 'key is you'.

For example, if I move the 'ball is' block next to the 'key' rule, I could make 'key is you'. But how to position them?

The key is at 5 steps right and 3 up. The 'is' rule is at 6 steps right and 3 up. So if I can move the 'is' from there to after the key, it would become 'key is you'. But the 'is' is part of the existing 'key is win' rule. So moving it would break that rule and create a new one.

Alternatively, take the 'is' from 2 steps left and 3 up (which is part of 'wall is stop') and move it next to the key. But that might require moving multiple blocks.

This seems complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since I'm Baba and can push objects that aren't STOP, perhaps I can push the key or other blocks to create a path.

But the key is at 5 right, 3 up, which is a distance. Also, there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up. If I can make that wall not a stop, then I can go around it.

To do that, I need to delete the 'wall is stop' rule or change it. The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of 'wall' at 3 left, 3 up, 'is' at 2 left, 3 up, and 'stop' at 1 left, 3 up. So those three blocks form the rule.

If I can move one of these blocks, the rule would break. For example, moving the 'stop' block away would make the rule 'wall is' instead of 'wall is stop', making walls passable.

But to move the 'stop' block, which is at 1 left, 3 up, I need to go there. From my current position (assuming I'm at baba's rule, 3 left, 2 down), moving left 1 and up 3 would get to the 'stop' block. But the path might be blocked.

Looking at the map, from the 'baba' rule (3 left, 2 down), moving left 1 step would be to 4 left, 2 down. Then up 3 steps to 4 left, 5 down? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the available text blocks and see which ones I can reach.

The 'ball is' rule is at 1 step right. If I can move that to create a new rule, say 'ball is stop', but that might not help. Alternatively, create 'you is win' or something.

Wait, the goal is to become the key. Since key is win, if I can make myself key, then touching the key would make me win. To become key, I need a rule 'baba is key' or 'you is key'. Since I'm you, 'you is key' would work.

To create 'you is key', I need the 'you' text block and the 'key' text block next to each other. The 'you' block is at 1 step left, 2 down. The 'key' block is at 5 right, 3 up. That's quite far apart.

Alternatively, use existing 'is' blocks to connect them. There's an 'is' at 6 right, 3 up (part of 'key is win') and another 'is' at 2 left, 3 up (part of 'wall is stop'). Maybe move the 'is' from 6 right, 3 up to between 'you' and 'key'.

But to do that, I need to navigate to that 'is' block. From my current position, moving right multiple times and up.

This is getting quite complicated. Maybe another angle: since the key is at 5 right, 3 up, and there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, perhaps I can push the wall out of the way. But the wall is part of the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move the wall, but walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless I change the rule.

Alternatively, if I can create a 'push' rule, but there's no such rule yet. The default is you can push objects that are not stop. Since wall is stop, I can't push them. But if I remove 'stop' from wall, then I can push walls.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the 'stop' text block from its current position to elsewhere, thereby changing 'wall is stop' to 'wall is', making walls passable.
2. Then navigate around the walls to the key.

But how to move the 'stop' block. It's located at 1 step left and 3 steps up from Baba's position. To reach it, I need to move left 1 and up 3. But the path might be blocked.

From Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), moving left 1 step would be to 4 left, 2 down. Then up 3 steps: each up moves one step. But along the way, are there any objects? Let's see:

Looking at the objects:

- At 2 right, 3 up: wall.
- At 3 right, 3 up: rule 'key' part of 'key is win'.
- Etc.

Wait, if I move left from my current position (3 left, 2 down) to 4 left, 2 down, is there a wall there? Not according to the objects listed. The walls are at specific positions relative to the player.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the origin, and all other positions are relative. For example, 'rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 3 step up' means that from the player's position, there's a wall 3 left and 3 up.

In that case, to reach the 'stop' block at 1 left and 3 up, the player would need to move left 1 and up 3. But the problem is that moving up 3 steps from the player's position might pass through the wall at 2 right, 3 up (which is 2 steps right from the player). Wait, no, the wall at 2 steps right and 3 up would be in the opposite direction if the player is at 3 left, 2 down.

This is getting too confusing without a visual map. Let's try to outline the steps again:

Current active rules:
- wall is stop
- key is win
- baba is you

Goal: Reach the key (which is win) by either moving it or changing the rules.

Possible actions:
1. Move text blocks to change rules.
2. Push non-stop objects to create paths.

Since walls are stop, I can't push them. But other objects like rules or the key might be movable if they're not stop.

The 'ball is' rule is at 1 step right. If I can move that 'is' to connect 'key' with 'you', that could work. For example, moving the 'is' from 6 right, 3 up (part of 'key is win') to between 'you' and 'key', creating 'you is key'.

To do that, I need to move the 'is' block from 6 right, 3 up to near the 'you' block at 1 left, 2 down. That's a significant distance, but maybe possible by moving step by step.

Alternatively, use the 'ball is' rule to create a new rule. If I move 'ball is' next to 'key', making 'key is ball', but that doesn't help unless I become ball.

Alternatively, create 'baba is win' by moving the 'win' block from 7 right, 3 up to next to 'baba'. But 'baba' is at 3 left, 2 down, so moving the 'win' block there would require a lot of steps.

This is really tricky. Maybe the easiest way is to focus on moving the 'stop' block to disable the wall rule.

The 'stop' block is at 1 left, 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since it's not a stop (the rule is 'wall is stop', not 'stop is stop'), I can move it.

Assuming I can move the 'stop' block, moving it down or right would remove it from the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable.

For example, moving 'stop' one step to the right would make the rule 'wall is', then I can walk through walls.

Once walls are passable, I can go around the wall at 2 right, 3 up and reach the key at 5 right, 3 up.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the 'stop' block at 1 left, 3 up.
2. Move the 'stop' block away, say to the right, changing the rule to 'wall is'.
3. Navigate around the walls to the key.

But how to reach the 'stop' block. From the player's position (assuming it's at the 'baba' rule's location: 3 left, 2 down), moving left 1 and up 3 would get to the 'stop' block.

Let's break it down:

- Current position: Let's assume it's at (0,0) for simplicity.
- 'wall' rule components:
  - 'wall' at (-3, 3)
  - 'is' at (-2, 3)
  - 'stop' at (-1, 3)
- Key is at (5, 3)
- 'you' rule components:
  - 'baba' at (-3, -2)
  - 'is' at (-2, -2)
  - 'you' at (-1, -2)

So to get to the 'stop' block at (-1, 3), the player needs to move from (0,0) to (-1, 3). The path would involve moving left 1, then up 3. But along the way, are there any walls?

Looking at the walls:

- There's a wall at (2, 3), which is to the right and up. From (0,0) to (-1,3), the path is left and up, so no walls in the way. The wall at (2,3) is in the opposite direction.

So moving left 1 step to (-1,0), then up 3 steps to (-1,3), where the 'stop' block is. Once there, move the 'stop' block. Since it's not a stop, I can move it. For example, move it right to (0,3), removing it from the 'wall is stop' rule.

After that, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then navigate to the key at (5,3). The path would be right through the former wall at (2,3), which is now passable.

So the action sequence would be:

1. Move left 1.
2. Move up 3.
3. Move right (to take 'stop' block away).
4. Then move right 5 steps and up 0 to reach the key.

But the problem is that each action is a single step. So I need to give a single action based on the current observation.

In the latest observation, after several right moves, the player might be near the 'ball is' rule or other blocks. But the last few actions were right, leading to getting stuck.

Looking at the latest observation before the final one, the player is trying to move right multiple times, but perhaps the map layout is such that moving right isn't leading towards the key.

In the current observation, the active rules are the same, and the objects are positioned as before. The player needs to choose an action.

Given that the previous attempts to move right led to DEFAULTED","

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are still wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and I can move unless there's a wall stopping me. The goal is to get the key, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. Let me visualize the map based on the positions given.

The player (Baba) is presumably at the position where the ""rule baba"" is located, which is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So, starting from there, maybe I need to move towards the key. But there's a wall blocking the path. Let's see the layout:

- Up 3 steps: walls and rules.
- Right 2 steps up: wall.
- Right 2 steps: another wall at 2 steps right, 1 step up. Then there's a rule 'ball' at 1 step right. Hmm, maybe the ball is movable if I change the rules.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So down from the current position (3 left, 2 down). If I move right, maybe I can get past the walls. But the wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down is a problem. Unless I can change the 'wall is stop' rule to something else, making walls passable.

But how? To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. The current rules are 'wall is stop', 'key is win', 'baba is you'. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 3 left, 3 up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can redefine wall's property.

But to move a rule, I have to be adjacent to the text block and the subject/object it's defining. For example, to change 'wall is stop', I need to move either the 'wall' rule or the 'stop' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 3 left, 3 up, and 'stop' is at 1 left, 3 up.

If I move the 'stop' rule to somewhere else, then maybe 'wall' wouldn't be 'stop' anymore. Let's see. If I can pick up the 'stop' rule (which is at 1 left, 3 up) and move it to another spot. For example, moving it next to the 'key' rule so that it becomes 'key is stop', but that might not help. Alternatively, moving it to combine with another rule.

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule like 'baba is stop', but since I'm Baba, if I make myself stop, I can't move. Not helpful.

Wait, the rule 'baba is you' is at 3 left, 2 down. So I'm controlling Baba. If I can change that to 'baba is win', then I'd be the win condition. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule and the 'win' rule together. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 2 down, and 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up. That's too far.

Alternatively, maybe move the 'win' rule down to where I am. The 'win' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move that down, say to my current position, then 'baba' would be 'win', making me win. But to move the 'win' rule, I need to be next to it. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 up. From my current position (3 left, 2 down), that's a long way. I need to navigate there, but there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, look for movable objects. The ball is at 4 right, 2 up. There's a rule 'ball is' at 1 right. If I can make the ball a 'you' or 'win', then maybe I can push it towards the key. But to do that, I need to reposition the 'is' rules.

The 'is' rule is at various positions. For example, at 2 left, 3 up; 6 right, 3 up; 1 left, 2 down; etc. If I can move an 'is' rule next to the ball and a property like 'you', then I can make 'ball is you'. But the 'you' rule is at 1 left, 2 down. So I need to get that 'you' rule near the ball.

But how to move the 'you' rule? Let's see. The 'you' rule is 1 step left and 2 steps down from the current position. If I move left twice, then down once, I can reach the 'you' rule. But moving left from my position (3 left, 2 down) would be to 5 left, 2 down. Then down to 5 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. Wait, the walls are at various positions, but the exact path needs to be checked.

Alternatively, maybe use the key. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. If I can get past the wall at 2 right, 1 down. But the wall is there because of 'wall is stop'. If I can remove that rule, then the wall becomes passable. But how?

Another idea: Since the key is a 'win' object, maybe just reach it. But the path is blocked by a wall. Unless I can turn myself into the key. If I can make 'baba is key', then reaching the key would make me the key, which is a win. To do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule and the 'key' rule together with an 'is' rule.

The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 2 down. The 'key' rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The 'is' rule is at 6 right, 3 up. If I can move the 'baba' rule to be next to the 'key' rule and the 'is' rule, then I can create 'baba is key'. But the distance is huge. I need to navigate through the map.

Alternatively, perhaps move the 'ball' rule. The 'ball' rule is at 1 step right. If I can make 'ball is win', then the ball would be a win condition. Then push the ball to where I am. But the ball is at 4 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 2 right, 2 up. Unless I can remove that wall's stop property.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to try to move towards the key, avoiding walls. Let's see my current position. Assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's position: 3 left, 2 down. To get to the key at 4 right, 1 down, I need to move right four times and down once. But the path is blocked. Let's map the steps:

From current position (3 left, 2 down):

1. Move right to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall? Looking at the objects, at 2 steps right there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, but that's up, not in this direction. Wait, the walls listed are at specific positions. Let me check:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So, horizontally at 2 steps right, there are walls at various vertical positions. Vertically, from my current position (3 left, 2 down):

Moving right:

- 1 step right: no wall mentioned here. The walls at 2 steps right are at different ups and downs.

Wait, the walls at 2 steps right are at:

- 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, same level (right 2), 1 down, 2 down, 3 down.

So, if I move right from my current position (3 left, 2 down) to 2 left, 2 down, that's adjacent right. Is there a wall there? The wall at 2 steps right is at positions like 3 up, etc., but vertically same as my current position? No, the wall at 2 steps right is at various vertical levels. So moving right to 2 left, 2 down is possible if there's no wall there. The walls at 2 steps right are at different up/down positions, not same level. So maybe I can move right.

But let me check the objects again. The objects listed include walls at 2 steps right and various vertical positions, but not at 2 steps right and 2 steps down (my current vertical level). So moving right should be possible.

So step by step:

1. Move right to 2 left, 2 down. No wall here.

2. Move right again to 1 left, 2 down. Check if there's a wall. Looking at the walls, at 2 steps right and various positions, but 1 left is different. No wall mentioned here. So okay.

3. Move right to 0 left, 2 down. Again, no wall listed here.

4. Move right to 1 right, 2 down. Check for walls. There's a rule 'ball' at 1 step right, but that's a movable object. So I can move into that.

5. Move right to 2 right, 2 down. Here, there's a wall at 2 right, 2 down. So can't move here. So this path is blocked.

Alternative path: move down first. From current position (3 left, 2 down):

1. Move down to 3 left, 3 down. There's a wall at 2 right, 3 down. Not helpful.

2. Move up. From 3 left, 2 down, move up to 3 left, 1 down. Is there a wall? The walls are at 2 steps right and various positions, but 3 left, 1 down isn't listed. So possible.

But then, moving up might not help. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, look for a way to redefine the rules. For example, if I can move the 'stop' rule away, then walls become passable.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. From my current position (3 left, 2 down), moving left to reach 1 left, 3 up would take several steps left and up, which is tedious. But maybe possible.

Let me try:

From 3 left, 2 down:

1. Move left to 4 left, 2 down.

2. Move left to 5 left, 2 down.

... This would take too many steps. Not practical.

Another idea: Use the 'ball' rule. The 'ball' rule is at 1 step right. If I can create a rule like 'ball is you', then I can move the ball instead of myself. But to do that, I need to move the 'ball' rule and a 'you' rule together with an 'is' rule.

The 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So if I can get the 'ball' rule next to the 'you' rule and an 'is' rule, I can make 'ball is you'.

Here's how:

1. Move to the 'you' rule's position: 1 left, 2 down.

2. Bring the 'is' rule there.

3. Then place 'ball' next to 'you' and 'is' to create 'ball is you'.

But getting there requires navigating past walls. From my current position (3 left, 2 down):

1. Move left to 4 left, 2 down.

2. Move left to 5 left, 2 down.

3. Move left to 6 left, 2 down.

4. Move left to 7 left, 2 down.

5. Move left to 8 left, 2 down.

6. Move up to 8 left, 1 down.

7. Move up to 8 left, 0 down (assuming down is negative).

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. The 'key is win' rule is active, so if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by a wall at 2 right, 1 down. If I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then the wall becomes passable.

To remove 'wall is stop', I need to move either the 'wall' rule or the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left, 3 up. Let's try to move that.

From my current position (3 left, 2 down), moving left to 1 left, 3 up would require:

1. Move left to 4 left, 2 down.

2. Move left to 5 left, 2 down.

3. Move left to 6 left, 2 down.

4. Move left to 7 left, 2 down.

5. Move left to 8 left, 2 down.

6. Move up to 8 left, 3 down.

7. Move up to 8 left, 4 down.

Wait, this isn't reaching 1 left, 3 up. Maybe I'm mixing coordinates. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up from where? The initial observation says the rule `stop` is 3 step up. Wait, the observation lists:

rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up

So the 'stop' rule is located 1 step to the left and 3 steps up from the reference point, which is probably Baba's position. But Baba's position is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the 'stop' rule is at (Baba's left +1, Baba's up +3) = 4 left, 5 up?

This is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to assume that all positions are relative to Baba's initial position. So if the 'stop' rule is 1 step left and 3 steps up from Baba's starting position, then moving there would involve:

From Baba's position (3 left, 2 down):

To reach 1 left and 3 up:

1. Move left once to 4 left, 2 down.

2. Move up three times to 4 left, 5 down (assuming down is negative, this would be up).

But there might be walls in the way. This seems too time-consuming and risky.

Alternative plan: Since the key is a win condition, maybe just push the key towards me if possible. But the key is an object; I can push it if it's not stopped. But the key is currently at 4 right, 1 down. To push it, I need to be adjacent and move in the same direction. But there's a wall at 2 right, 1 down blocking the path.

Wait, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. The wall is at 2 right, 1 down. So the key is two steps right from the wall. If I can move the wall out of the way, then I can push the key. But the wall is defined by 'wall is stop', so unless I change that, it's immovable.

Another angle: If I can make the ball a 'win' by creating 'ball is win', then maybe pushing the ball to my position would make me win. The ball is at 4 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 2 right, 2 up. So maybe I can move the 'win' rule to the ball's position.

The 'win' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. To move it to 4 right, 2 up, I need to move left three times and down one time. But this would require carrying the 'win' rule past other objects and walls. It's possible but time-consuming.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'baba is win' by moving the 'baba' rule and 'win' rule together with an 'is' rule. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 2 down, and 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up. This would require a lot of moving, but maybe feasible.

Step-by-step:

1. Move from current position (3 left, 2 down) to the 'is' rule that's at 2 left, 3 up. That's one left and one up.

2. Then move the 'is' rule next to the 'baba' rule.

3. Then move the 'win' rule next to them to form 'baba is win'.

But the distance is significant. Let's see:

From 3 left, 2 down:

1. Move left to 4 left, 2 down.

2. Move left to 5 left, 2 down.

3. Move left to 6 left, 2 down.

4. Move left to 7 left, 2 down.

5. Move up to 7 left, 1 down.

6. Move up to 7 left, 0 down.

7. Move up to 7 left, up (but this is getting too vague without a clear map).

This approach seems too complicated. Maybe the best immediate action is to try to move right towards the key, hoping there's no wall blocking. But earlier analysis suggested a wall at 2 right, 2 down. Wait, the current vertical position when moving right might be different.

Alternatively, move down towards the key. From current position (3 left, 2 down), moving down once to 3 left, 3 down. There's a wall at 2 right, 3 down. So can't go that way.

Move up. From 3 left, 2 down, move up to 3 left, 1 down. No wall mentioned here. Then move up again to 3 left, 0 down. Still no wall. Then move right. At 3 left, 0 down, moving right to 2 left, 0 down. No wall. Continue right to 1 left, 0 down. Then to 0 left, 0 down. Then to 1 right, 0 down. Here, there's a rule 'ball' at 1 step right. So I can move","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. That means I can move because I'm baba, but walls stop me. The key is the win condition, so I need to get to the key. Looking at the map, the key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from my current position. There's also a ball that's been turned into a stop by the rule ""ball is stop"" because there's a rule block saying rule `ball` 1 step to the right. So the ball is a stop now.

First, I need to navigate to the key. The path to the key seems blocked by walls. Let me check the objects around me. To the right, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Then further right, there's a rule `ball` block. But since ball is stop, maybe I can move past it if I can change the rules. Wait, the rule `ball` is 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule block somewhere else, maybe I can turn off the ""ball is stop"" rule.

But right now, the only movable things are the rules that aren't marked as stop. The ""ball is stop"" rule is a stop, so I can't move it. The other rules like ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"" are not stops, so maybe I can move those. Wait, but the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The other rule blocks like ""rule `wall`"", ""rule `is`"", etc., are separate objects. So if I can move those rule blocks around to create new rules, that could change the game.

Looking at the current setup, to the left of the key, there's a rule `key` at 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. Then a rule `is` and rule `win` following. If I can rearrange these rules to make ""key is you"" or something else, that might help. But how do I get there? The path is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the ""ball is stop"" rule out of the way first. But as I can't move it, perhaps I need to find another way.

Alternatively, since I'm baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push objects? Wait, in Baba Is You, you can only move text blocks or objects that are not defined as STOP. So walls are stop, but the key, ball, and other rules might be movable if they're not stop. Wait, the key is defined as win, but not stop, so I can move it. The ball, however, is stop because of the ""ball is stop"" rule, so I can't move it.

So my options are to either find a way to move past the ball (which is stop) or find a way to remove the ""ball is stop"" rule. Since I can't move the ""ball is stop"" rule, maybe I need to create a new rule that changes the property of ball. For example, if I can create ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win"", then the ball wouldn't be a stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" block somewhere else to break the ""ball is stop"" rule.

The ""rule `ball`"" block is 1 step to the right. If I can move that rule block away, then the ""ball is stop"" rule would be broken. But how? The rule blocks can only be moved if they're not defined as stop. Since ""rule"" itself isn't a stop unless there's a rule saying so. Looking at the active rules, there's no rule that says ""rule is stop"", so maybe I can move the ""rule `ball`"" block.

So the plan is: move the ""rule `ball`"" block away from the ball to break the ""ball is stop"" rule, then I can move over the ball. Once that's done, I can path towards the key. Let's see where the ""rule `ball`"" is located. From the observation, it's 1 step to the right. So if I move left from my current position, I can reach that rule block. Wait, my current position isn't specified, but based on the objects, I'm probably at the position of the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe not. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. From there, to get to the ""rule `ball`"" block that's 1 step to the right, I need to move right. But moving right might hit a wall. Let's check the path. To the right of the ""baba"" rule block, there's a wall 2 steps to the right. So moving right directly is blocked. Maybe I need to move in another direction first.

Alternatively, if I can push the ""rule `ball`"" block by moving next to it and then moving in a direction that pushes it. But since the rule block is 1 step to the right, if I'm adjacent to it, moving right would push it further right. But I need to check if I can move there. Let's see: the ""rule `ball`"" is at 1 step to the right. If I'm at the same position as the ""baba is you"" rule block (3 left, 2 down), moving right once would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up. Not sure about the down direction. Maybe there's a path.

Alternatively, maybe I need to go around the walls. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. To get there, I might need to move down past the walls. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and further down, walls at 2 steps right and 1 step down. The ball is at 4 steps right and 2 step up, which is a stop. So if I can remove the ""ball is stop"" rule, I can go around it.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""rule `ball`"" block (1 step to the right).
2. Move that rule block away, breaking the ""ball is stop"" rule.
3. Now the ball is no longer a stop, so I can move over it.
4. Navigate to the key, avoiding walls.

But how to move the ""rule `ball`"" block. Let's see its position: it's 1 step to the right. If I'm currently at the ""baba"" rule block (3 left, 2 down), moving right once gets me to 2 left, 2 down. Then I can move right again to 1 left, 2 down, where the ""rule `ball`"" is. Then, from there, I can move right again to push the rule block further right. Once the rule block is moved, the ""ball is stop"" rule is gone.

So the sequence would be: right, right, right. But need to make sure there are no walls in the way. Let's check the path:

From ""baba"" position (3 left, 2 down):

- Move right once: 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall here? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up, but that's up, not down. So probably no wall here. Then move right again to 1 left, 2 down, which is where the ""rule `ball`"" is. Then move right again to push it to 0 left, 2 down. Now the ""rule `ball`"" is moved, so the ""ball is stop"" rule is no longer active. The ball is now just a ball, not a stop.

Once that's done, I can move towards the key. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. From the new position of the rule block (0 left, 2 down), I need to navigate. Let's see:

From 0 left, 2 down:

- Move down to 0 left, 3 down. But there's a wall there (wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down). So can't go down.
- Move right to 1 left, 2 down. Is there a wall? At 2 steps right and 2 steps down, there's a wall. So moving right from 0 left, 2 down to 1 left, 2 down might be possible if there's no wall. Wait, the walls are at specific positions. Let me check the objects again:

Looking at the objects list:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- etc.

So from 0 left, 2 down, moving right would take me to 1 left, 2 down. There's no wall mentioned there. Then I can move right again to 2 left, 2 down. Then down to 2 left, 3 down, but there's a wall there. Hmm, maybe another path.

Alternatively, after moving the ""rule `ball`"", the ball at 4 steps right and 2 step up is no longer a stop. So I can go around it. From the position 0 left, 2 down, move right to 1 left, 2 down, then right to 2 left, 2 down, then down to 2 left, 3 down (but there's a wall), so instead go down to 2 left, 3 down is blocked. Maybe move up instead?

Wait, maybe a better path. After removing the ""ball is stop"" rule, the ball is just a normal object. So I can move around it. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So from my current position (after moving the rule block), which is 0 left, 2 down, I need to go right four steps and down one step. But there are walls blocking the way. Let's see:

From 0 left, 2 down:

- Right 1: 1 left, 2 down (no wall)
- Right 2: 2 left, 2 down (no wall)
- Right 3: 3 left, 2 down. There's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps up, but that's up, not here. So probably no wall.
- Right 4: 4 left, 2 down. That's where the ball is now (4 steps right and 2 step up from the original position, but relative to me, it's 4 left? Maybe I'm getting confused with directions.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are relative. Let me try to sketch the map mentally.

Assuming the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from some origin. The walls and other objects are positioned relative to that.

- rule `wall` is 3 left, 3 up: so that's northwest of the player.
- wall 2 steps right and 3 up: northeast of the player.
- rule `key` is 5 right, 3 up: further east.
- The ball is 4 right, 2 up: east and slightly north.
- The key at 4 right, 1 down: east and south.

So the player needs to go from their position (3 left, 2 down) to the key at (4 right, 1 down). The path is blocked by walls and the ball (which is now a stop unless the rule is moved).

By moving the ""rule `ball`"" block from 1 right to further right, the ""ball is stop"" rule is removed, so the ball becomes a movable object. Then the player can path around the ball.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move right three times to reach the ""rule `ball`"" block.
2. Move right again to push the rule block away.
3. Now the ball is no longer a stop, so move around it to the key.

But how to execute this in the game's movement system. Each move is one step in a direction. So from the player's position (assuming it's at the ""baba"" rule block's position):

Initial position: let's say the player is at (0,0), and all other positions are relative.

- rule `wall` at (-3, 3)
- wall at (2, 3)
- rule `key` at (5, 3)
- etc.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe simpler to focus on relative movements.

The ""rule `ball`"" is 1 step to the right of the player's current position. So if the player is at position (0,0), the rule `ball` is at (1,0). To move it, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. So:

1. Move right to (1,0) (the rule `ball` block).
2. Then move right again to (2,0), pushing the rule `ball` to (2,0).
3. Now the ""ball is stop"" rule is no longer in place because the rule block is moved.

Once that's done, the ball at (4,2) (assuming) is no longer a stop. Then the player can move towards the key at (4,1).

The path from (2,0) to (4,1) would involve moving right twice and up once. But need to check for walls.

From (2,0):

- Right to (3,0): is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps up, but that's (2,2) relative. Not sure. Maybe need to check the list again.

Looking back at the objects:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: (2,3)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2,2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: (2,1)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down: (2,-1)
- etc.

So from (2,0), moving right to (3,0) is possible. Then up to (3,1). But there's a wall at (2,1), which is two steps right and one step up from the origin. Wait, relative to the player's current position (2,0), moving up to (2,1) would be into the wall at (2,1). So can't go up from (2,0). Instead, maybe move down to (2,-1), but there's a wall there as well (2 steps right and 1 step down from origin is (2,-1)). 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a different approach. After moving the rule `ball` to (2,0), the player is at (2,0). The key is at (4,1). The ball is now at (4,2) but is no longer a stop. So the player can move right to (3,0), then right to (4,0), then up to (4,1), which is the key. But need to check if there's a wall between (4,0) and (4,1).

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up (which is (2,1)) and further down at 2 steps right and 1 step down (2,-1). But (4,1) is the key's position. Is there a wall at (4,1)? According to the objects list, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the origin, which would be (4,-1). Wait, maybe the coordinates are mixed up. This is getting too ambiguous without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the simplest valid action at this point is to move right, which was previously attempted but resulted in failure. Maybe the issue is that the model isn't correctly identifying the valid moves based on the current rules and object positions. Given the feedback that previous actions failed, perhaps the correct action now is to move down towards the key, avoiding the walls.

But given the confusion in coordinates, perhaps the best valid action is to move right, as it's a common action to try and reach the rule blocks needed to change the game rules.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move around unless there's a wall, which stops me. The goal is to get the key, which is considered a win object.

Looking at the map, I see a key located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's also a ball at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. The rules mention that key is win, so grabbing the key should let me win. But there are walls blocking the path. 

First, I need to see where Baba is positioned. From the objects listed, the rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So my starting position is left of the center, down a bit. I need to move towards the key at (4 right, 1 down). 

Looking at the path: moving right towards the key, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up. Wait, no, the walls are at various positions. Let me check the objects again. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up, then another wall at 2 right and 2 step up, and so on. The key is at 4 right and 1 down. So from my current position (3 left, 2 down), moving right would first take me to the positions indicated by the rules. 

But wait, the rule `baba` is at 3 left and 2 down. So to move right, I need to see if there's a wall blocking. The walls are at 2 steps right and 3 up, which is above me. Moving down from my position, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So to get to the key at 4 right and 1 down, I need to navigate past these walls. 

Wait, the key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from where? Let me clarify the positions. The rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So if I'm at (0,0) for simplicity, then the rule `baba` is at (-3, -2). The key is at (4, -1). So moving from (-3,-2) to (4,-1) requires moving right 7 steps and up 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up (which would be (2,3)), then another at 2 right and 2 up ((2,2)), and so on. The key is at (4,-1). So maybe I need to find a way around the walls. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the rules to change what's a stop or win. 

The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. If I can change the 'stop' rule, maybe I can remove the walls. For example, if I can make 'wall' not a stop, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule text block. The 'stop' rule is located 1 step to the left and 3 step up from the rule `wall` position. Wait, the rule `stop` is at 1 step left and 3 up from where? Let me check the objects again. 

The rule `wall` is at 3 step left and 3 step up. Then rule `is` is 2 left and 3 up. Rule `stop` is 1 left and 3 up. So the 'stop' rule is adjacent to the 'is' and 'wall' rules. To move the 'stop' rule, I need to push it. But can I? The rules say that objects defined as 'stop' or similar are immovable. So if 'stop' is a property, maybe the text blocks with 'stop' are also stop. So I can't move them. 

Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe instead of removing 'stop', I can create a new rule that changes Baba's property. For example, if I can make Baba a Win, then I don't need the key. But how? To do that, I need to create a new rule like 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule text block next to 'baba'. 

Looking at the objects, the 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 up. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left and 2 down. To get the 'win' rule next to 'baba', I need to move both or reposition them. But moving requires avoiding walls. The key is at 4 right and 1 down. Maybe I can first go get the key, but the path is blocked. 

Alternatively, perhaps moving the 'ball' rule. There's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right. If I can make ball a you or win, but I'm already a you. The goal is to be win, which is the key. 

Wait, the key is win. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the key is behind walls. Let me see the positions again. From my current position (3 left, 2 down), moving right: 

- If I go right once, I'm at 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up, but that's above. At 2 left, 2 down, maybe it's open. Wait, the walls listed are at specific positions. Let me list all walls:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So the walls are all aligned vertically to the right of the center. So from my position at 3 left, 2 down, moving right would take me towards the right side. The first step right would be to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are all at 2 steps right (i.e., their x-coordinate is 2?), but the positions are described relative to the rule blocks. Maybe the coordinate system is relative to Baba's position. This is getting a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out in a grid where each step is in a direction. To reach the key at 4 right and 1 down, I need to move right multiple times and down. But the walls are blocking. Maybe I can go around them by moving up first, then right, then down. 

For example, from my position (3 left, 2 down), move up to avoid the walls above. But moving up would take me towards the wall at 3 left and 1 down? Not sure. This is tricky without a visual map. 

Another approach: Since the key is a win, maybe I don't need to go through the walls. If I can change the 'win' rule to be Baba, then I can win just by being Baba. The 'win' rule is currently at 7 steps right and 3 up. If I can move that rule next to 'baba', then 'baba is win' would be active. 

To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule text block. The 'win' rule is part of the current rules, so it's a text block that I can move, right? But wait, the rules say that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar. Since 'win' is a property, not necessarily an object, maybe the text block for 'win' can be moved. 

The 'win' rule is a text block located at 7 steps right and 3 up. To move it to near the 'baba' rule, which is at 3 left and 2 down, I need to navigate through the grid. But the path might be blocked. However, if I can move the 'win' rule directly, perhaps by pushing it past other objects. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'key' rule. The 'key' is an object, and the rule 'key is win' is separate. If I can make 'key' not a win, but that's not helpful. 

Wait, the current rules are 'wall is stop', 'key is win', and 'baba is you'. If I can create a new rule like 'baba is win', then I don't need the key. To do that, I need to combine 'baba' with 'win' using an 'is' rule. So I need to move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win'. 

Looking at the objects, there's an 'is' rule at 2 step left and 3 step up, and another at 1 step left and 2 steps down. If I can move the 'is' rule from the upper left to near the 'baba' and 'win' rules, I can create the new rule. 

But moving requires avoiding walls. The 'is' rule at 2 left and 3 up is near the 'wall' and 'stop' rules. To move it down, I need to check if the path is clear. Let's say I move the 'is' rule down to 1 left and 2 down, which is where another 'is' rule is. Maybe there's space there. 

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to the left next to 'baba'. The 'win' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. To get it near 'baba' at 3 left, 2 down, I'd need to move it left and down. But that's a long distance, and there are walls along the right side. 

This seems complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to reach the key by moving around the walls. Let's try to plan a path. From 'baba' at 3 left, 2 down:

1. Move right once to 2 left, 2 down. Is there a wall? Looking at the walls listed, the closest walls are at 2 right and various ups and downs. But 'right' here would be increasing the x-coordinate, while the walls are at 2 steps right (fixed x=2?), maybe. This is confusing without a grid. 

Alternatively, perhaps the movement is relative to the current position. For example, each 'right' moves Baba one step to the right on the grid. The walls are at specific coordinates. Let's assume the grid is such that moving right from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down) would take him to positions closer to the right side of the map where the walls are. 

Given the walls are all clustered to the right (at 2 steps right and various up/down positions), moving left might be better, but the key is to the right. Hmm. 

Another idea: Since the key is a win, maybe I can push a wall to block another path, but that doesn't help. 

Wait, perhaps the ball can be used. There's a ball at 4 right and 2 up. If I can make the ball a you or win, but I'm already a you. If I make the ball win, then standing on it would win. But the ball is at 4 right, 2 up, which is above the key. Maybe I can move the ball to the key's position, but that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, use the ball to block a wall, but I don't see how. 

Back to the original problem: The assistant keeps failing to provide valid actions because the previous answers were just 'right' or 'left', but maybe those aren't valid given the current position and walls. 

Looking at the latest observation, after some moves, the positions might have changed. The last observation shows that after moving right, the positions of the rules might have shifted. For example, the rule `wall` is now at 3 step left and 3 step up, which was perhaps moved by previous actions. 

Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are the same: wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The objects are listed with their positions. The rule `baba` is at 3 step left and 2 steps down. So maybe in previous moves, the assistant tried to move right but got blocked, leading to the same position. 

To break the loop, perhaps the correct action is to move down towards the key. The key is at 4 right and 1 down. From Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), moving down once would be to 3 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Checking the walls listed, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. That's on the right side, not where I'm moving. So moving down might be possible. 

Alternatively, move right and down. But need to avoid walls. 

Another approach: Since the key is a win, and it's behind walls, perhaps the intended solution is to change the 'stop' rule. If I can make 'wall' not a stop, then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to reposition the 'stop' rule text block. The 'stop' rule is currently at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then the property 'stop' would no longer be associated with 'wall', making walls passable. 

To move the 'stop' rule, I need to push it using adjacent objects. The 'stop' rule is next to the 'is' and 'wall' rules. If I can move the 'is' rule, perhaps that would allow moving the 'stop' rule. But 'is' is a text block; can it be moved? Since 'is' isn't defined as stop, maybe yes. 

So the plan would be:

1. Move the 'is' rule that's at 2 left and 3 up to the right, which might allow moving the 'stop' rule.
2. Once 'stop' is moved, walls become passable.
3. Then move through the walls to the key.

But how to execute this? Let's see. The 'is' rule at 2 left and 3 up. To move it right, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Since I'm at 3 left and 2 down, I need to move up and right to get near the 'is' rule. 

From my position (3 left, 2 down), moving up once gets me to 3 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the walls listed, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. That's on the right side, not affecting my current move. 

So moving up to 3 left, 1 down. Then move right to 2 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 2 right and various positions, so this might be clear. 

Once next to the 'is' rule at 2 left and 3 up, I can push it right. But how? My position would need to be adjacent to the 'is' rule. Let's see:

If I move up to 3 left, 1 down, then right to 2 left, 1 down, then up to 2 left, 2 down, then up to 2 left, 3 down? Not sure. This is getting too vague without a visual. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct action here is to move down towards the key's location. Since the key is at 4 right and 1 down, moving down from my current position (3 left, 2 down) would be to 3 left, 3 down. If there's no wall there, I can move down. 

Checking the walls, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. That's on the right side, so my path down should be clear. 

So the action could be 'down'. 

Alternatively, move right once to 2 left, 2 down. If that's not blocked, then proceed. 

But without knowing the exact layout, it's challenging. Given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action now is to move down to get closer to the key's location.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba because of ""baba is you"". The key is the win object, so I need to get to the key.

Looking at the map objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, which is a stop. Also, there's a rule 'ball' at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Right now, I'm at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down. Wait, where exactly is Baba positioned?

From the objects list, the rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down from the current position. Let me visualize this. If I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule, then moving right would take me closer to the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Also, the key is at 4 steps right. So moving directly right might hit a wall.

Wait, maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If I can change the 'key is win' rule, maybe the key becomes something else, like a stop, so I can move over it. But how?

The rules are on the map as text blocks. For example, 'rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up' means the key's rule is there. To change a rule, I need to move the 'is' text next to a different property. Like, if I can move the 'is' next to 'ball' instead of 'key', then maybe 'key' becomes a different property. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block.

Looking at the current objects, the 'is' blocks are at various positions. For instance, there's a rule `is` at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can move that 'is' to link 'key' with another property, maybe 'win' can be reassigned. But how do I move the 'is' block? I need to be on the same tile as the 'is' block and then move it in a direction, but only if I'm not stopped.

Wait, the active rules say 'wall is stop', so any object with 'stop' can't be moved. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. Are there any 'stop' objects on the map that are blocking the path? The walls are all marked as stop, so moving into them is impossible.

Right now, my position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 3 steps left and 1 step down from where I need to be. Wait, maybe I'm at the position of the 'baba' entity. The 'rule `baba`' is 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the previous observation. Let me check the latest observation.

In the latest observation, the 'rule `baba`' is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. So my position is that rule's location. To get to the key at 4 steps right, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Also, the key is at 4 steps right, same level as the current position? Let me map this out.

Current position: rule `baba` at 3 left, 1 down. So if I move right once, I'm at 2 left, 1 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right (from where? Maybe the map's coordinates are relative). This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the 'you' rule to make Baba have a different property. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then touching the key would win the game. But how?

The 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. To attach that to 'baba', I need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'you'. The 'is' block is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that 'is' to connect 'baba' with 'you', making 'baba is you' the rule, which it already is. Wait, the active rules already have 'baba is you'. So maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, the key is the win object. If I can change the 'key is win' rule to something else, like 'key is stop', then the key becomes a wall, and I can move over it. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block that's connected to 'key' and 'win'. The 'is' block for the key is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that 'is' block next to 'key' and another property, say 'stop', then 'key is stop' would be the rule, making the key a stop, allowing me to walk over it.

But to move that 'is' block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. My current position is at the 'baba' rule, which is 3 left and 1 down. The 'is' block for the key is at 6 right and 3 up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a path to get there by moving through other objects.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the 'ball' rule. There's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that 'ball' rule next to the 'key' and 'stop' rule, that might create a new rule. But I need to be able to move the 'ball' rule. Since 'wall is stop', but the 'ball' rule isn't a wall, so it can be moved.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, so any wall is immovable. The 'ball' rule isn't a wall, so it can be moved. If I can move the 'ball' rule to connect with 'key' and 'stop', that could change the rule. But how to get there?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move down towards the key. The key is at 4 steps right. If I move down, maybe I can find a path around the walls. Let me check the layout.

Current position: rule `baba` at 3 left, 1 down. Moving down would take me to 3 left, 2 down. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So moving down might not help. Maybe moving right step by step, but the walls are blocking.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make the key not a stop. For example, if I can make 'key' a 'you' instead of 'win', then touching the key would make me the win condition. But how?

The 'key is win' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. The 'is' block for that is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that 'is' to link 'key' with 'you', then 'key is you' would be the rule, and touching the key would make me you, but I'm already you. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, make 'baba is win'. If I can change the 'baba' rule to be 'win', then touching anything would win. But the 'baba is you' rule is at 3 left and 2 down. The 'is' block for that is at 2 left and 2 down. If I can move that 'is' to link 'baba' with 'win', then 'baba is win' would be active, making me the win condition.

To do that, I need to move the 'is' block that's currently between 'baba' and 'you' (at 2 left and 2 down) to instead connect 'baba' with 'win'. But where is the 'win' text block? The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. That's quite far from where the 'is' block is.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule closer. The 'win' rule is a text block that can be moved if it's not a stop. Since 'wall is stop', but 'win' is a property, not a wall, it can be moved. So if I can move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and an 'is' block, that could create a new rule.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of the immediate steps. The key is at 4 steps right. To get there, I need to move right past the walls. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe if I can remove that wall's 'stop' property.

The wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up has the 'stop' rule at 1 step left and 3 step up. So the 'stop' property is a rule, not the wall itself. To remove the 'stop' property from the wall, I need to delete or rearrange that rule.

But how? The 'stop' rule is a separate text block. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, then the wall wouldn't be a stop anymore. But moving the 'stop' rule requires being adjacent to it and moving it. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. From my current position (3 left, 1 down), moving left three steps and up two steps would get me there. But that's a long path with walls blocking.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the 'ball' rule. The 'rule `ball`' is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that 'ball' rule next to the 'stop' rule, creating a new rule like 'ball is stop', but I'm not sure if that helps.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let's recap. The goal is to reach the key, which is the win object. To do that, I need to either get past the walls blocking the path or change the rules so that the key isn't a win or the walls aren't stops.

Another angle: Since I'm Baba (baba is you), if I can make 'baba is win', then touching anything would win. To do that, I need to create a new rule 'baba is win'. The existing 'baba is you' rule is at 3 left and 2 down. The 'is' block for that is at 2 left and 2 down. If I can move that 'is' block to connect 'baba' with 'win', then the new rule would be active.

The 'win' text block is at 7 right and 3 up. The 'is' block is at 2 left and 2 down. To connect 'baba' (at 3 left, 2 down) with 'win' (7 right, 3 up), I need to move the 'is' block from 2 left, 2 down to be between 'baba' and 'win'. That would require moving the 'is' block right and up, but the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe moving the 'win' text block closer. The 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move it left, perhaps next to the 'baba' rule. But moving the 'win' block would require being adjacent to it and not being stopped. The 'win' block isn't a stop, so it can be moved.

So, possible steps:
1. Move down from current position (3 left, 1 down) to 3 left, 2 down. There's a wall there, so can't move down.
2. Move right towards the key. Let's see: from 3 left, 1 down, moving right once gets to 2 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the walls are at specific positions relative to the current position.

This is getting confusing without a visual map. Let's try to parse the objects again.

Current position is rule `baba` at 3 step to the left and 1 step down. Let's assume the coordinate system is relative, so moving right increases the X coordinate, up increases Y, etc.

Active rules:
- wall is stop
- key is win
- baba is you

Objects:
- rule `wall` at 3 left, 3 up
- rule `is` at 2 left, 3 up
- rule `stop` at 1 left, 3 up
- wall at 2 right, 3 up
- rule `key` at 5 right, 3 up
- rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up
- rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up
- wall at 2 right, 2 up
- ball at 4 right, 2 up
- wall at 2 right, 1 up
- rule `ball` at 1 right, 1 up
- wall at 2 right
- wall at 2 right, 1 down
- key at 4 right
- rule `baba` at 3 left, 1 down
- rule `is` at 2 left, 1 down
- rule `you` at 1 left, 1 down
- wall at 2 right, 1 down
- wall at 2 right, 2 down

So, plotting this out:

Looking at Y=3 up:
- From left: rule wall, rule is, rule stop, wall, rule key, rule is, rule win.

Y=2 up:
- wall, ball, wall.

Y=1 up:
- rule ball, wall.

Y=0 (current level):
- walls at 2 right, 2 right, 1 down (wait, not sure).

Y=1 down:
- key at 4 right, wall at 2 right, 1 down.

Y=2 down:
- wall at 2 right, 2 down.

Current position: rule `baba` at 3 left, 1 down. So that's somewhere to the left of the key area.

To reach the key at 4 right, I need to move right. But between here and the key, there are walls at 2 right positions. For example, at Y=0 (current level), there's a wall at 2 right. At Y=1 up, wall at 2 right, 1 up. So moving right directly is blocked.

Maybe the solution is to move the 'key is win' rule to make the key not a win, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, make myself a win by changing 'baba is win'.

To do that, I need to create a new rule 'baba is win'. The existing 'baba is you' rule is at 3 left, 2 down. The 'is' block for that is at 2 left, 2 down. If I can move that 'is' block to connect 'baba' with 'win', then the new rule would be active.

The 'win' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. So I need to move the 'is' block from 2 left, 2 down to be between 'baba' (3 left, 2 down) and 'win' (7 right, 3 up). That would require moving the 'is' block right and up, but there are walls in the way.

Alternatively, use the 'ball' rule. If I can make 'baba is ball', then maybe interacting with the ball does something. But not sure.

Another idea: The key is at 4 right. If I can push the key by moving it, but the key is a win object. Moving it might be allowed if it's not a stop. But since key is win, not sure. Also, to push the key, I need to be adjacent and move in the same direction.

From current position (3 left, 1 down), moving right to 2 left, 1 down. There's a wall at 2 right, 1 down (from the objects list: wall at 2 right, 1 step down). So can't move right into that.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinates. Let's clarify:

Assuming the current position is at (0,0), and the directions are relative.

rule `baba` is at 3 step to the left (X=-3) and 1 step down (Y=-1).

Other objects:

- rule `wall` at X=-3, Y=3
- rule `is` at X=-2, Y=3
- rule `stop` at X=-1, Y=3
- wall at X=2, Y=3
- rule `key` at X=5, Y=3
- rule `is` at X=6, Y=3
- rule `win` at X=7, Y=3
- wall at X=2, Y=2
- ball at X=4, Y=2
- wall at X=2, Y=1
- rule `ball` at X=1, Y=1
- wall at X=2, Y=0
- wall at X=2, Y=-1
- key at X=4, Y=0
- rule `is` at X=-2, Y=-1
- rule `you` at X=-1, Y=-1
- wall at X=2, Y=-1
- wall at X=2, Y=-2

So the map looks like this (simplified):

Y=3:
- X=-3: rule wall
- X=-2: rule is
- X=-1: rule stop
- X=2: wall
- X=5: rule key
- X=6: rule is
- X=7: rule win

Y=2:
- X=2: wall
- X=4: ball
- X=2: wall (same Y but different X?)

Wait, maybe the coordinates are unique per object. So each object's position is absolute.

Current position: X=-3, Y=-1 (rule `baba`).

To reach the key at X=4, Y=0, need to move right. But between X=-3 and X=4, there are obstacles.

Path options:

1. Move right through Y=0: but at X=2, Y=0 there's a wall. So can't go through there.

2. Move up to Y=1 or Y=2, find a path.

At Y=1, there's a rule `ball` at X=1, Y=1 and a wall at X=2, Y=1. So moving up","

Let's try to figure out the solution here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I need to reach the key because it's defined as win. But there are walls nearby that stop me. I look at the objects on the map.

There's a ball object at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. There's a rule for ball at 1 step right and 1 step up. Wait, the rule 'ball is' might be somewhere else. Let me check again. Oh, there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So that's creating the rule ""ball is [something]"". But what's it paired with? Maybe it's part of a rule like ""ball is push"" or something. But in the current active rules, I don't see that. So perhaps that rule is separate.

The key is at 4 steps to the right. But between me (Baba) and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and another wall at 2 steps right. Also, the path down from where I am might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the layout.

Baba is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down. So my current position is 3 steps left and 1 step down from that rule. The key is at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to move right towards the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps right. Wait, the wall is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up? Hmm, maybe I need to check the exact positions again.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `baba` is at 3 left, 1 down.
- So Baba's position is 3 left and 1 down from that rule. Wait, the rule itself is an object. Maybe Baba is at that position? Or is the rule located there, and Baba is a separate object? The observation says ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"", but in the current observation, it's 3 step to the left and 1 step down. So current position of the rule 'baba' is 3 left, 1 down. Assuming that the Baba entity is associated with that rule, maybe Baba is at that position.

So if I'm at 3 left, 1 down, and the key is at 4 steps right, I need to move right. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

To the right of Baba's position (3 left, 1 down), there's a wall at 2 steps right. So moving right directly would hit a wall. But maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to bypass the walls.

The rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule somewhere else to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win"", but the key is already win. Alternatively, maybe make ""you is ball"" so that the ball becomes the player.

But how to do that? The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So I am Baba, defined as you. To reach the key (which is win), I need to get past the walls.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule next to the ball, then maybe create a new rule like ""ball is you"". But the ball is at 4 steps right and 3 steps up. The rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 1 step up. So the distance between them is quite far. Maybe I can move the rule `ball` closer to the ball.

Alternatively, maybe use the existing rule `ball` to change its property. If I can move the 'is' rule next to it. For example, the rule `is` is at 2 step left and 1 step down. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `is` is at 2 step to the left and 1 step down from the rule `baba`. So if I can move the 'is' next to the 'ball' rule, I could create a new rule like ""ball [something]"".

But the problem is that objects marked as 'stop' can't be moved. Checking the active rules: wall is stop. So any object with 'wall' property can't be moved. The walls are at various positions, but the rule `ball` and other rules might not be stop. So perhaps the rules themselves can be moved if they're not part of a stop rule.

So the plan is: move the 'ball' rule next to the ball object and pair it with an 'is' rule to create a new rule. For example, moving the 'ball' rule to be adjacent to the ball and then using an 'is' rule to say ""ball is you"", making the ball the player.

To do that, I need to navigate to the 'ball' rule, which is at 1 step right and 1 step up from Baba's position. Wait, Baba's position is 3 step left and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule. So if the 'baba' rule is at, say, coordinate (0,0), then Baba is at (-3, -1). The 'ball' rule is at (1,1) relative to that. So moving right and up.

But moving up might hit walls. Let's see. From Baba's position (-3, -1), moving right would take me to (-2, -1). Then right again to (-1, -1), then to (0, -1), but there's a wall at 2 steps right, which would be (2, -1) maybe? Wait, the walls are at positions like 2 steps right and 3 step up, etc. Maybe the coordinates are a bit different. This is getting confusing. Perhaps I should focus on the relative positions.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 steps to the right, so from Baba's position, moving right four times would get there, but the walls are in the way. So need to find a path around.

Another approach: since the key is defined as win, maybe I can change the win condition to something else that's accessible. For example, if I can make ""win is ball"", then reaching the ball would win the level. But how to do that?

To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule next to the ball and change its property. The 'win' rule is currently at 7 steps to the right and 3 step up. The ball is at 4 steps right and 3 step up. So the 'win' rule is further to the right. Maybe move the 'win' rule left to be next to the ball, and then use an 'is' rule to change it.

But moving the 'win' rule requires moving it past other objects. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. So perhaps that's a blocker.

Alternatively, use the existing 'key is win' rule. If I can move the 'key' to be next to the 'win' rule and then change the 'win' to something else. But the key is at 4 steps right, and the 'win' rule is at 7 steps right. So moving the key left to 7 steps right would place it next to the 'win' rule, but that might not be possible due to walls.

This is tricky. Let's recap the objects again:

- rule `wall` positions: various
- rule `is` positions: various
- rule `stop` positions: various
- wall objects: various
- ball at 4 right, 3 up
- key at 4 right, 1 down
- rule `baba` at 3 left, 1 down
- rule `you` at 1 left, 1 down

So the key is directly below the ball. Maybe the path from Baba to the key is blocked by walls, but maybe there's a way to use the ball to push or move walls. However, the ball's current rule is just 'ball' at 1 right, 1 up. If I can make the ball a 'push' object, then perhaps I can push walls aside. But to do that, I need to create a new rule like ""ball is push"".

To create that rule, I need to move the 'ball' rule (which is at 1 right, 1 up from Baba) next to the 'is' rule and then add a 'push' property. But where is the 'is' rule? In the current observation, the 'is' rule is at 2 left, 1 down from Baba's position. So relative to Baba, that's 2 steps left and 1 step down. So to get to the 'is' rule, I need to move left and down.

Alternatively, move the 'is' rule next to the 'ball' rule. Let's see. The 'is' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. So from Baba's position, moving left twice and down once would get to the 'is' rule. Then, move the 'is' rule to be adjacent to the 'ball' rule. Once they're adjacent, combining them would create a new rule like ""ball is [something]"".

But to do that, I need to move both the 'ball' rule and the 'is' rule. Let's think of the steps:

1. Move from Baba's position (3 left, 1 down) to the 'is' rule at 2 left, 1 down. That would be one step left.

2. Then, move the 'is' rule to the right towards the 'ball' rule. But the 'is' rule is an object; can I move it? Assuming it's not a stop object, yes. So moving the 'is' rule right once would place it next to the 'ball' rule (which is at 1 right, 1 up from Baba's original position).

Wait, the 'ball' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step up from Baba. So if I'm at the 'is' rule (2 left, 1 down), moving right would take me to 1 left, 1 down. But the 'ball' rule is at 1 right, 1 up from Baba. So the positions might be different. This is getting a bit confusing with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the 'ball' rule towards the 'is' rule so they can form a new rule. For example, if the 'ball' rule is next to an 'is' rule and a 'push' or another property, then it would create ""ball is push"".

But where is the 'push' rule? It's not present in the active rules. So maybe I need to create it by combining 'ball' and 'is' with another property. But there's no 'push' text block on the map. So perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, the available text blocks are the ones listed in the objects. Let me check again. The objects on the map include:

- rule `wall`
- rule `is`
- rule `stop`
- wall
- rule `key`
- rule `win`
- ball
- rule `ball`
- key
- rule `baba`
- rule `you`
- walls at various positions.

So the available text blocks are wall, is, stop, key, win, ball, baba, you. No push, so can't create that.

Alternative idea: Since the key is win, maybe I can reach it by making Baba into a key. If I can change the rule to ""baba is key"", then since Baba is you, you would be key, which is win. So reaching the key would then make you win. But how to do that.

To do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule and the 'key' rule together with an 'is' rule. The current 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 1 down. The 'key' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. The 'is' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. So maybe move the 'is' rule next to the 'baba' and 'key' rules to form ""baba is key"".

But the distances are quite large. From Baba's position, moving left to reach the 'baba' rule (which is at 3 left, 1 down), then moving up to reach the 'key' rule. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, use the existing 'baba is you' rule. If I can make 'you' into 'key', then since Baba is you, he becomes key, which is win. To do that, change the 'you' rule to 'key'. The 'you' rule is at 1 left, 1 down. If I can move that to say 'key', but the text blocks available are fixed. You can only move the text blocks around, not change their text. So you can't directly change 'you' to 'key'; you have to create a new rule ""you is key"" and remove the old ""key is win"", but that might not be possible.

Wait, the rules are formed by combining a subject and a property with an 'is' rule. For example, ""baba is you"" is formed by the 'baba' rule next to the 'is' rule next to the 'you' rule. So to change ""key is win"" to something else, you need to move the 'key' rule and the 'win' rule with an 'is' rule.

But the 'key' rule is at 5 right, 4 up, and the 'win' rule is at 7 right, 4 up. So they're adjacent horizontally. The 'is' rule is at 6 right, 4 up (since rule `is` is 6 steps to the right and 3 step up from the original position, but wait in the current observation, the 'is' rules are at various positions. This is getting too complicated without a visual.

Perhaps the simplest way is to move towards the key and look for a way to bypass the walls using the ball. If the ball can be made into a pushable object, then maybe push the walls aside. But to do that, we need to create ""ball is push"".

To create that rule, we need the 'ball' rule, an 'is' rule, and a 'push' rule. But there's no 'push' text block on the map. So that's not possible.

Alternative approach: Use the existing 'ball' rule to create a new rule. For example, if we can make ""ball is stop"", then the ball becomes a wall, but that's not helpful. Or ""ball is you"", making the ball the player. To do that, move the 'ball' rule next to an 'is' rule and a 'you' rule.

The 'you' rule is at 1 left, 1 down. The 'ball' rule is at 1 right, 1 up. The 'is' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. So maybe move the 'is' rule to the right and up to be next to the 'ball' and 'you' rules.

Let's see. From the 'is' rule's position (2 left, 1 down), move right once to 1 left, 1 down. Then move up once to 1 left, 0 down. Then move right again to 0 left, 0 down. Now, if the 'ball' rule is at 1 right, 1 up from Baba's original position, which is 3 left, 1 down. So Baba's original position is maybe at (0,0), and the 'ball' rule is at (1,1). The 'is' rule is moved to (0,0), then next to the 'ball' rule at (1,1). But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Move right to reach the 'ball' rule.
2. Move the 'is' rule next to the 'ball' rule.
3. Then, since there's a 'you' rule nearby, combine them to make ""ball is you"".

But I need to see the exact positions. The 'you' rule is at 1 left, 1 down from Baba. So if I move the 'is' rule to the right and up, I can place it between the 'ball' rule and the 'you' rule.

This is quite complex. Another idea: since the key is win, and it's at 4 steps right, maybe I can walk there if there's a path. But the path is blocked by walls. However, if I can turn the walls into something passable, like changing their rule.

For example, if I can make ""wall is you"", then since walls would be you, I could move through them. But how? To do that, I need to move the 'wall' rule and the 'you' rule with an 'is' rule.

The 'wall' rule is at 3 left, 3 up. The 'you' rule is at 1 left, 1 down. So the distance is significant. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, use the ball to push the walls. If the ball is pushable, then push the walls away. But again, need to make the ball pushable.

Wait, the ball currently has a rule at 1 step right and 1 step up: rule `ball`. That might mean the rule ""ball is [something]"" is being formed. But what? It's only the 'ball' text block, so maybe it's incomplete. To create a rule, you need a subject, 'is', and a property. So the existing rule `ball` is just the subject part; it needs an 'is' and a property to form a complete rule.

So the rule `ball` at 1 right, 1 up is incomplete. If I can move an 'is' rule next to it and then a property like 'push', then it becomes ""ball is push"". But there's no 'push' text block, so that's not possible.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct action is to move towards the key and hope there's a way around, but given the walls, that's unlikely. Alternatively, try to manipulate the rules to make the ball the player.

Given the previous failed attempts, maybe the solution is to move the 'ball' rule next to the 'is' and 'you' rules to create ""ball is you"". Let's try that.

From Baba's position (3 left, 1 down), the 'ball' rule is at 1 right, 1 up. The 'is' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. The 'you' rule is at 1 left, 1 down.

So to reach the 'is' rule, move left once. Then, from there, move up and right to get to the 'ball' and 'you' rules. But this requires navigation around other objects.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is","

Let's see. The problem is that I need to get the key, which is marked as win, but I'm currently stuck. The active rules are still wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move, but walls stop me.

Looking at the map layout from the latest observation, I need to figure out where I am. The key is 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right, then another wall, then the key. Wait, the key is at 4 steps to the right. Let me check the positions again.

The objects list has the key at 4 steps to the right. But there's a rule `ball` at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. Also, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. So, maybe my position is somewhere else. Let's see the rules for Baba. The rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. So, if the rule `baba` is at 3 left and 1 down from some point, I need to figure out where that is.

Wait, the rule blocks have positions relative to something. Maybe the player's position is implied. For example, if the rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down, then my position would be 3 steps right and 1 step up from that rule block. So, rule `baba` is at (3 left, 1 down) from my current position. Let me try to map this.

Assuming the rule `baba` is at position (x, y), then my position is (x + 3, y + 1). But without a reference point, it's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the rule blocks are placed on the map, and I need to move towards them to manipulate the rules.

The key is at 4 steps to the right. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to move around the wall. Let's check the layout again.

The wall at 2 steps to the right is at 2 right. Then the key is at 4 right. So there's a gap between 2 and 4? Let's see the objects:

rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up

wall 2 steps to the right

key 4 steps to the right

So between 2 right and 4 right, there's the key at 4, but what's in between? The wall is at 2, then maybe open space at 3, then key at 4. So if I can get past the wall at 2 right, I can go to 3, then 4 to get the key.

But how to get past the wall? The wall is a stop, so I can't move into it. Unless I can change the rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. Maybe if I can create a new rule that makes the wall not stop, or make myself able to move through it.

Looking at the available text blocks. There's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 1 up. Also, there's rule `stop` at 1 step left and 3 up. Maybe I can move some of these text blocks to create new rules.

For example, if I can move the `stop` rule somewhere else, or combine it with another subject. But to move a text block, it can't be defined as stop. The current rules have wall is stop, so any object that is stop can't be moved. Wait, the tip says you can only move objects or text that are not defined as STOP or similar immovable properties. So if a text block is part of a rule, like ""wall is stop"", then the text block ""stop"" might be movable unless it's part of a rule that makes it stop. 

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" makes walls have the stop property. But the text block ""stop"" itself is an object. If the ""stop"" text block isn't part of an active rule that makes it immovable, then it can be moved. Let's check the active rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. There's no rule that makes text blocks like ""stop"" or ""win"" immovable. So those text blocks can be moved.

So, perhaps I can move the ""stop"" rule to a different position. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block away from the wall rule, then the wall might no longer be considered a stop. Let's see. The current rule is ""wall is stop"", which is made by the rule `wall` 2 step left and 3 step up, then `is`, then `stop` at 1 step left and 3 step up. So the rule is formed by those three text blocks. If I can move the `stop` text block, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, making walls no longer stop.

But to do that, I need to move the `stop` text block. Its position is 1 step left and 3 step up from the `is` text block. So if I can move the `stop` text block, perhaps to a different location, then the wall rule would be disrupted.

Alternatively, I could create a new rule that makes, say, Baba able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba is move"". But to create that, I need to have the necessary text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 1 up. Also, there's `is` rules scattered around. If I can move the `ball` text block to create a new rule. For instance, if I move `ball` next to `baba` and `is`, then create a rule ""baba is ball"", which might make me a ball. But if I'm a ball, and the key is win, then touching the key would win. But balls might have different properties. However, the current active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key wins, regardless of what I am. Wait, no—the ""win"" property is on the key. So if I can reach the key, then I win. But the problem is getting past the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a rule that makes the key not a win, and instead make Baba a win. For example, ""baba is win"". But then I would already be a win, so touching anything would win? Not sure. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so the win condition is the key. So the goal is to reach the key.

Another approach: Since the key is at 4 steps to the right, and there's a wall at 2 steps to the right, maybe I can move the wall rule. The wall is defined by the rule ""wall is stop"". If I can move the ""wall"" text block or the ""stop"" text block, the rule would break. For example, moving the ""wall"" text block away from the ""is"" and ""stop"" text blocks would break the rule. Let's see where the ""wall"" rule is located.

The rule `wall` is at 2 step left and 3 step up, then `is` at 1 step left and 3 step up, then `stop` at 1 step left and 3 step up. So the rule is formed by those three. If I can move the ""wall"" text block, then the rule would be disconnected. But can I move the ""wall"" text block? It's part of an active rule, but the rule is ""wall is stop"", which makes walls have the stop property. The text block ""wall"" itself is not stop; it's the subject of the rule. So maybe the ""wall"" text block can be moved.

If I move the ""wall"" text block to a different position, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer be connected, effectively removing the rule. That way, walls wouldn't be stop anymore, and I could pass through them. Then I could go around the wall to get to the key.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""wall"" text block away from the ""is"" and ""stop"" text blocks to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Then move through the wall to reach the key at 4 steps right.

But how to move the ""wall"" text block. Its current position is 2 step left and 3 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that takes me to the desired position. But where am I located?

Looking at the rule `baba` which is 3 step to the left and 2 steps down from the `is` text block at 2 step left and 2 step down. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 3 step left and 2 steps down. So if the `is` text block is at 2 step left and 2 step down, then the `baba` rule is 3 steps left and 2 steps down from there. So my position would be 3 steps right and 2 steps up from the `is` text block.

This is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to focus on the positions of the key and the walls. The key is at 4 steps right. There's a wall at 2 steps right. If I can move past that wall by breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, then I can proceed.

To break the rule, I need to move either the ""wall"" text block, the ""is"" text block, or the ""stop"" text block. Let's see where they are:

- The ""wall"" text block is at 2 step left and 3 step up.
- The ""is"" text block is at 1 step left and 3 step up.
- The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 3 step up.

So these three form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move any of these, the rule breaks.

The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that to a different position, the rule would be broken. But how to reach it? My current position needs to be adjacent to the ""stop"" text block.

Assuming my position is determined by the rule `baba` which is 3 step left and 2 step down from the `is` text block at 2 step left and 2 step down. So the `is` text block is at (2 left, 2 down). The `baba` rule is at (2 left + 3 right, 2 down + 2 up) = (1 right, 0). So my position is at 1 step right and 0 steps down (assuming the reference point is the `is` text block's position).

From there, looking at the map, the ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So relative to my position (1 right, 0), the ""stop"" is at left 1 + right 1 = 0 left, and up 3. So it's 3 steps up and 1 step left from me. To reach it, I need to move left and up. But can I get there without hitting walls?

Alternatively, maybe there's a path. Let's think step by step.

Current position: Assume I'm at (1, 0) based on the `baba` rule's position.

The ""stop"" text block is at (0, 3) (1 step left from me, 3 steps up).

The path from (1,0) to (0,3):

- Move left once to (0,0).
- Then up three times to (0,3).

But along the way, are there any walls?

Looking at the wall positions:

- Wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up: That's (2,3) if my position is (1,0).
- Wall at 2 steps right and 2 step up: (2,2).
- Wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up: (2,1).
- Wall at 2 steps right: (2,0).
- Wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down: (2,-1).
- Wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down: (2,-2).

So moving left from (1,0) to (0,0) is possible, no wall there. Then up to (0,1): is there a wall? The walls are at (2,x), so (0,1) is clear. Up to (0,2): same, clear. Up to (0,3): that's where the ""stop"" text block is. So no walls in that path. So I can move left three times and up three times to reach the ""stop"" text block.

Once there, I can move the ""stop"" text block to a different position, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then I can move through the wall at (2,3) to reach the key at (4,3).

But how to move the ""stop"" text block. After reaching it at (0,3), I can move it in any direction, as long as I'm adjacent. For example, move it down to (0,2), then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be disconnected because the ""stop"" is no longer connected to the ""is"" and ""wall"" text blocks.

Once the rule is broken, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then from my current position at (0,3) after moving the ""stop"" block, I need to get to the key at (4,3).

The path from (0,3) to (4,3):

- Right four times: (1,3), (2,3) which is a wall, but now walls don't stop me, so I can go through.
- So move right past the wall at (2,3) to (3,3), then to (4,3) which is the key.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move left from (1,0) to (0,0).
2. Move up three times to (0,3).
3. Move the ""stop"" text block down to (0,2).
4. Move right four times, passing through walls, to reach (4,3) and grab the key.

But the problem is that each move must be a single step, and I have to output the correct action at each step. However, the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation, not the entire sequence. So in the current observation, I need to determine the best first action.

Looking at the latest observation, after some previous moves, the positions have changed slightly. For example, the rule `wall` is now at 3 step to the left and 4 step up, and the `stop` is at 1 step to the left and 4 step up. So the ""wall is stop"" rule has moved up a step.

Assuming my current position is still around (1,0), I need to check if I'm adjacent to any movable objects. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 4 step up, which is relative to where? If the rule `wall` is at 3 left and 4 up, then the `is` would be at 2 left and 4 up, and `stop` at 1 left and 4 up.

So the ""stop"" text block is at ( -1, 4 ) if my position is (0,0). To reach it, I need to move left and up.

But perhaps the exact positions are different. This is getting too complicated without a visual map. Let's try to simplify.

The key is at 4 steps right. There's a wall at 2 steps right. To get past the wall, I need to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, I need to move one of the text blocks forming the rule: ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"".

The ""stop"" text block is currently at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that to a different location, say, next to something else, the rule breaks.

So the immediate action would be to move towards the ""stop"" text block. From my current position, which I assume is near the `baba` rule, I need to figure out the direction to the ""stop"" block.

If the ""stop"" is 1 step left and 4 steps up, and I'm at, say, (0,0), then moving left once and up four times would get me there. But each move requires one action. However, the system might require a single action at a time.

But the problem is that in the current observation, after previous failed actions, the positions might have shifted. The latest observation shows rule `wall` at 3 step left and 4 up, rule `is` at 2 left and 4 up, rule `stop` at 1 left and 4 up. The key is at 4 right.

Assuming I'm currently at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 3 step left and 1 step down from the `is` at 2 left and 1 down. So `is` is at (2 left, 1 down), then `baba` is 3 left and 1 down from there, so (2 left -3, 1 down +1) = (-1, 2). So my position is (-1, 2).

The ""stop"" text block is at 1 left and 4 up, which is (-1 +1, 2 +4) = (0,6). So from my position (-1,2), I need to move right to 0, then up to 6. That's a distance of 1 right and 4 up. But that's a lot of steps. However, the immediate action would be to move right once towards the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer text block to move. For example, the `ball` rule at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can move that to create a new rule, maybe making myself a ball and then using the key's win property.

But the key is win regardless, so touching it would win. The problem is getting there. If I can become the key, then maybe? But the active rule is ""key is win"", so maybe if I become the key, touching myself would win. Not sure.

Alternatively, create a rule ""baba is win"". Then, just by existing, I win. But how to create that rule. Need the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"". The ""win"" text block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, currently at 7 steps right and 3 up.

So to create ""baba is win"", I would need to move the ""","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is probably to get the key, which is marked as win. But since key is win, maybe touching the key makes you win? Or maybe the rule means that the key itself is the win condition.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right. But there's also a rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up. Wait, maybe that's a text block saying ""key is win""? Because the active rules already have key is win. Hmm, maybe the key is nearby, but there are walls blocking the path.

The player is likely Baba, controlled by the ""baba is you"" rule. So moving right might get closer to the key, but there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, and other walls. Let me check the map again.

From the observation, the player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down. So if that's the position, maybe the player is at coordinates that are 3 left and 1 down from the rule block. Wait, the rules are part of the map. Let me visualize this.

The map has several rule blocks. The ""baba is you"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 down from the `you` rule. The key is at 4 steps to the right. But between the player and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. So how to get past the wall? Maybe by moving the wall rule or creating a new rule.

Since walls are stop, perhaps the player needs to rearrange the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if the player can move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. Wait, the positions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the objects again.

The objects list includes:
- rule `wall` 3 step left and 3 step up
- rule `is` 2 step left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step left and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps right and 3 step up
And so on. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" arranged horizontally. The wall itself is at 2 steps right and 3 step up. So the actual wall is a separate object, and the rule defines that walls are stop.

To move past the wall at 2 steps right, the player might need to remove the ""stop"" property from walls. But how? By destroying the text blocks that form the rule. However, the player can only move objects that are not defined as stop. So if the player is Baba, and ""baba is you"", but the walls are stop, the player can't push the walls unless they change the rule.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""stop"" rule elsewhere. For example, if the player can move the ""stop"" text block, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer be active, making walls passable. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. Is that a text block that the player can move?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So that's a text block saying ""stop"". To move it, the player would need to navigate to that position. But how to get there without hitting walls?

The player's current position is rule `baba` 3 step left and 1 step down. So perhaps the player is at a position that's 3 left and 1 down relative to that rule block. Maybe the player is at (0,0) and the rules are arranged around. This is a bit unclear, but the key idea is that the player needs to reach the key, but blocked by walls and stop rules.

Another approach: Since the key is a win object, touching it might win the level. But the key is at 4 steps to the right, but there's a wall at 2 steps to the right. So perhaps moving right twice would get past the wall if it's not a stop. Wait, the wall at 2 steps right is a wall object, and because of the rule ""wall is stop"", it's immovable. So the player can't push it, but maybe can move around it?

But looking at the map layout, the player is probably near the left side. The key is to the right, but there's a horizontal line of walls at 3 step up, 2 step up, etc. Maybe the player needs to go around the walls by moving down or up.

Alternatively, the player can create a new rule to make themselves not stop. For example, if the player can write ""baba is not stop"" by moving text blocks. But the player needs to have the relevant text blocks. There's a ""win"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up, but how to get there?

This is getting a bit complex. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Move right towards the key, but blocked by walls. So need to find a path around.
2. Check if any walls can be removed by moving their rules. For example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three text blocks: wall, is, stop. If the player can move these, they can break the rule.
3. To move the text blocks, the player must be able to reach their positions. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If the player can move there, they might be able to relocate the rule.

But how to get to that position? The player's current position is 3 steps left and 1 step down from the ""baba is you"" rule. If the player moves right, maybe they can reach the area of the rules.

Wait, the player is at the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 steps left and 1 step down from the ""you"" rule. So maybe the player is located somewhere in the lower left area. To reach the ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 3 step up, the player would need to move up and left. But there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, the player could move the ""ball is win"" rule? Wait, there's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right. If the player makes ""ball is you"", then they could turn into a ball and maybe pass through walls. But the current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you.

If the player can move the ""ball"" rule and combine it with ""is"" and ""you"", they could create ""ball is you"". Then, if they touch a wall, they might not be stopped. But this requires manipulating the text blocks.

Another angle: The key is at 4 steps to the right. There's a key object there, and a rule ""key is win"" at 5 steps right and 3 step up. So the key is already marked as win, so touching it should win the level. But the path is blocked.

Perhaps the player needs to move the wall blocking the path. The wall at 2 steps right is a physical wall (object) that's stop due to the rule. To move it, the player would need to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how?

If the player can move the ""stop"" text block, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer be active, making walls passable. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So the player needs to navigate to that position.

Assuming the player's current position is near the ""baba"" rule, moving right and up might get them to the ""stop"" rule. For example, moving right twice, then up three steps. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the wall objects are at various positions, like 2 steps right and 3 step up, which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule's horizontal arrangement.

This is quite complex. Let's try to map out possible moves step by step.

Current Position: Assume the player is at the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 steps left and 1 step down from the ""you"" rule. So coordinates might be something like (0,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (-3, 1). The ""you"" rule is at (-2, 1). The ""stop"" rule is at (-1, 3). The wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up would be at (2,3). But this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 steps left and 1 step down from the ""you"" rule. So if the ""you"" rule is at (0,0), then ""baba"" is at (-3, -1). The ""stop"" rule is at (-1, 3). To get there, the player would need to move right twice and up four steps, but there might be walls in the way.

This is getting too vague. Let's think differently. The key is at 4 steps right. The player needs to get there. If they can move the key, but keys are win, so maybe moving the key isn't necessary. Alternatively, the player can push the key if it's not stop. But keys are defined as win, not stop, so they might be movable.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So keys are win but not necessarily stop. So the key can be moved. If the player can move the key to their position, but that's probably not necessary. The goal is to touch the key, so the player just needs to reach it.

But the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 2 steps right is stop, so the player can't push it. So the player must find another way around. Maybe going down past the walls?

Looking at the map, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and another at 2 steps right and 2 step up, etc. So maybe the player can go down to the key's level. The key is at 4 steps right and same level as the wall? Let's check:

The key is at 4 steps right, and there's a wall at 2 steps right. So between them, there's space. If the player moves right past the wall at 2 steps right, but that wall is stop. So perhaps the player needs to move the wall's rule.

Alternatively, the player can create a new rule that makes themselves not stop. For example, if they can write ""baba is not stop"" by moving text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""win"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 step up, an ""is"" at 6 steps right and 3 step up, and a ""key"" at 5 steps right and 3 step up. So the ""key is win"" rule is horizontal there. Also, there's a ""ball is"" rule at 1 step right and 1 step up.

If the player can gather the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""not"", ""stop"" and arrange them, they could create a new rule. But where are the ""not"" and ""stop"" blocks? There's a ""stop"" block at 1 step left and 3 step up, and a ""not"" block... Wait, I don't see a ""not"" block in the objects list. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, the player can rewrite the existing ""wall is stop"" rule to make walls something else. For example, move the ""stop"" block to a different position, making the rule ""wall is [nothing]"", which would remove the stop property. But to do that, the player needs to move the ""stop"" text block.

The ""stop"" block is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If the player can move that block, say, to the same position as another rule, they could change the rule. But how to reach that position?

The player's current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 1 step down. So moving right and up might get them closer. For example, moving right once to get to 2 steps left, then up to 3 step up. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, the wall objects are at specific positions. The wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule's horizontal arrangement.

This is really tricky. Maybe the best approach is to move right towards the key, hoping that the path clears up or that there's a way around. Alternatively, try to move the key towards the player.

But the key is at 4 steps right. If the player can move the key by pushing it, since keys are win and not stop, they might be movable. So if the player moves right towards the key, they might be able to push it. But there's a wall at 2 steps right blocking the path.

Alternatively, the player can go around the wall by moving down. Let's see the layout:

At 2 steps right and 3 step up: wall
At 2 steps right and 2 step up: wall
At 2 steps right and 1 step up: wall
At 2 steps right: wall
At 2 steps right and 1 step down: wall
At 2 steps right and 2 steps down: wall

So there's a vertical wall at 2 steps right from step up 3 down to step down 2. The key is at 4 steps right, same level as the player's current position (assuming player is at 2 steps right). So if the player moves right past the wall at 2 steps right, but that's blocked. Maybe the player can move down past the walls and then right?

For example, if the player moves down from their current position (which is at the ""baba"" rule, 3 left and 1 down), moving down would take them to the same position but one step down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So moving down might not help.

Alternatively, the player can move up past the walls. But there are walls at 2 steps right up to 3 step up. So moving up from the player's position might not avoid the walls.

Another idea: The player can use the ""ball"" rule. There's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up. If the player can create ""ball is you"", then they could turn into a ball and pass through walls. To do that, they need to move the ""ball"" text block, ""is"", and ""you"" together.

The ""you"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule. So the player needs to gather the ""ball"", ""is"", and ""you"" blocks. Let's see their positions:

- rule `ball` is 1 step right and 1 step up from the ""baba"" rule.
- rule `is` is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the ""baba"" rule? Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down relative to where? The observation lists objects with their positions relative to the map, but it's a bit unclear.

This is really challenging without a visual map. Maybe the best feasible action is to keep moving right towards the key, hoping that eventually the path opens up or that the walls can be moved. Alternatively, try to move down to see if there's a way around.

Given the previous actions where moving right was attempted but failed due to invalid actions (maybe the player couldn't move there because of walls), perhaps the correct action now is to move down to navigate around the blockages.

70,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what action I should take here. The current observation shows the active rules are still ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to reach the key, which is defined as win in the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. There's also a rule `key` at 5 steps to the right and 5 steps up, but I think that's part of the existing rules. The rule `you` is at 1 step to the left, which I assume is connected to the Baba rule since ""baba is you"".

Now, considering the layout: My position isn't explicitly stated, but since the rules are ""baba is you"", I must be at the position of the Baba object. From the objects listed, the rule `baba` is at 3 steps to the left. So if I'm at that position, moving right would be towards the key.

But wait, there are walls blocking the path. The wall is defined as ""stop"", so I can't move through them. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Also, there's a key at 4 steps right and 1 step down, but that might be the same as the one mentioned earlier. 

Looking at the objects again, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, no, in the current observation, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Let me check again. The key is listed as ""key 4 steps to the right and 1 step up"". But there's also a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So moving right directly towards the key would be blocked by that wall. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move around the wall. If I'm at 3 steps left (Baba's position), moving right would take me to 2 steps left, then 1 step left, then to my current position? Wait, maybe I need to figure out the exact positions. Let's try to visualize the grid.

Assuming Baba's position is at the rule `baba` which is 3 steps to the left. So if I'm at (0,0), then 3 steps left would be (-3,0). The rule `baba` is at 3 steps left, so maybe my position is there. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's position. So from (-3,0), moving right 4 steps would be (1,0), and 1 step up would be (1,1). But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's position, which is (-3,0) plus 2 right and 1 up: (-1,1). So that wall is at (-1,1). The key is at (1,1), but there's a wall at (-1,1), so moving directly right and up would hit that wall.

Alternatively, maybe I can move down first. If I move down from Baba's position at (-3,0), I can go to (-3,-1), but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down, which would be (-3 +2, 0 -2) = (-1,-2). Not sure if that's relevant. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me list them again.

Walls are at:
- 3 steps right and 3 step up (from original position)
But in the current observation, walls are at:
- 2 steps right and 5 step up
- 2 steps right and 4 step up
- 2 steps right and 3 step up
- 2 steps right and 2 step up
- 2 steps right and 1 step up
- 2 steps right (at the base)
- 2 steps right and 1 step down

So the path directly to the key (4 steps right, 1 step up) is blocked by a wall at 2 steps right, 1 step up. So I can't go through that. Maybe I need to go around. If I move right twice, then up, but that wall is in the way. Alternatively, maybe move down first to avoid the wall.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I can get past the wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, maybe by moving around it. Let's see. If I move right once to the first step, then right again, but the wall is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So if I'm at (-3,0), moving right once gets me to (-2,0). Then moving right again to (-1,0), but there's no wall there. Then moving up to (-1,1), but there's a wall at (-1,1). So that's blocked.

Alternatively, maybe move down first. From (-3,0), move down to (-3,-1). Then right to (-2,-1), (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (2,-1), (3,-1). Then up to (3,0), but that's the rule `baba` position. Not helpful. Then up again to (3,1), which might be clear. But the key is at (1,1). This seems convoluted.

Another approach: Since the key is a ""win"" object, maybe I can change the rules to make the wall passable. The existing rules are ""wall is stop"". If I can create a new rule that says ""wall is not stop"", then I could move through walls. To do that, I need to find the text blocks for ""wall is stop"" and ""is"", then rearrange them.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` 3 steps left and 5 step up, followed by `is` 2 steps left and 5 step up, then `stop` 1 step left and 5 step up. So the original rule ""wall is stop"" is at that position. To break this rule, I need to move the ""stop"" text block away. But wait, can I move text blocks? Only if they are not defined as ""stop"" or similar immovable properties. The ""is"" and ""stop"" in the rule ""wall is stop"" might be moveable unless the rule specifies otherwise. 

In the current rules, ""wall is stop"" makes walls immovable (since they are stop). But the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" themselves are part of the rule, so if they are not part of another rule that makes them stop, they might be movable. Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" makes any object named ""wall"" have the property ""stop"", making them immovable. However, the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" that form the rule are objects on the map, and if they are not part of another rule that makes them stop, they should be movable. 

So, the text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are located at 3 left,5 up; 2 left,5 up (is); and 1 left,5 up (stop). If I can move these text blocks, I can delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, moving the ""stop"" text block away would break the rule. 

But how to do that? Let's see. My current position is at the rule `baba` which is 3 steps left. So if I move right, I can reach the area near the rules. For instance, moving right once gets me to 2 steps left, which is the `is` part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then moving up to 5 steps up would reach the ""wall"" text block. But I need to navigate there carefully, avoiding other walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes ""stop"" to something else. For example, if I can make a rule like ""stop is key"", then walls would no longer be stop. But to do that, I need to find the ""stop"" text block and rearrange it with ""key"".

But first, I need to move the existing text blocks. Let's think step by step:

1. Current position: 3 steps left (Baba's rule position).
2. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left,5 up (wall), 2 left,5 up (is), 1 left,5 up (stop).
3. To break this rule, I need to move either the ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" text block.
4. Let's try moving the ""stop"" text block. From its position at 1 left,5 up, I can move it down or left/right.
5. Moving ""stop"" down one step would place it at 1 left,4 up. That would break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls no longer stop.
6. To do that, I need to path from my current position (3 left) to the ""stop"" text block at 1 left,5 up.

The path from 3 left to 1 left is moving left two steps. But I'm at 3 left, so moving left once gets me to 2 left, then again to 1 left. From there, I need to move up 5 steps to reach the ""stop"" block. However, there might be walls along the way. Looking at the map, the walls are at 2 steps right and various up/down positions. But from 1 left, moving up, are there walls? At 2 steps right and 5 step up, there's a wall. But that's part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, not a blocking wall. Wait, the actual walls on the map are at positions like 2 steps right and 3 step up, etc. So moving from 1 left (Baba's position after moving left twice) to 1 left,5 up might be possible if there are no walls in between.

Assuming there are no walls blocking the path up from 1 left, moving up to 5 step up would reach the ""stop"" text block. Then, moving it down one step would break the rule. Once ""wall is stop"" is broken, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then I can go straight to the key at 4 right,1 up.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make touching Baba count as winning. But that's a different approach.

So the plan is:

1. Move from 3 left (current position) to 1 left by moving left twice.
2. Move up 5 steps to reach the ""stop"" text block at 1 left,5 up.
3. Move the ""stop"" text block down one step to 1 left,4 up, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Now, walls are no longer stop, so navigate to the key at 4 right,1 up, walking through walls if necessary.

But how to execute this in the allowed actions? Each action is a single step. So I need to sequence multiple moves, but the system might only accept one action per step. Wait, the user is asking for a single action to take based on the current observation. So maybe I need to choose the next immediate action.

In the current observation, where am I positioned? The active rules include ""baba is you"", so my position is where the Baba object is. The Baba rule is located at 3 step to the left. So my position is at 3 step left. Let's assume coordinates: if Baba is at (0,0), then 3 step left is (-3,0). The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's position, which would be (1,1) if Baba is at (0,0). Wait, no. If Baba's position is at 3 steps left (from where?), maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on the relative positions.

The key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up from the Baba rule's position. The Baba rule is at 3 steps left. So if I'm at 3 steps left, moving right once gets me to 2 steps left, then again to 1 step left, then to my current position (assuming Baba is at 3 steps left). Wait, this is getting too confusing without a clear coordinate system. Let's try a different approach.

The key is located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to move right four times and up once. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make that wall passable by breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule, then I can go through it. To break that rule, I need to move the ""stop"" text block from its current position.

The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps up. So from my current position (3 steps left), I need to move left twice to get to 1 step left. Then move up five steps to reach the ""stop"" block. Once there, I can move it down one step.

But each action is a single step. So the next immediate action should be to move left twice to reach the area near the ""stop"" block. Wait, but in the current observation, after moving right multiple times previously, maybe my position has changed. Looking back at the history, the assistant was moving right multiple times, but those actions failed. Maybe the system is resetting or there's a different state.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is currently unreachable because of the wall, and the only way is to alter the rules. So the immediate action should be to move towards the ""stop"" text block to break the rule.

In the current observation, the ""stop"" text block is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps up. My position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps to the left. So to get to the ""stop"" block, I need to move left twice (from 3 left to 2 left, then to 1 left), then move up five steps. But each move is a single step. So the first action should be to move left once to reach 2 steps left. But wait, the latest observation shows that after previous actions, the position of the ""baba"" rule might have changed. 

Looking at the latest observation, the ""baba"" rule is at 3 step to the left. So my position is there. To get to the ""stop"" block at 1 left,5 up, I need to move left twice and up five times. But each action is a single step. So the next immediate action should be to move left. But maybe there's a wall in the way. Let me check the walls around my current position.

In the current observation, walls are at 2 steps right and various positions, but from my position at 3 steps left, moving left is possible unless there's a wall. The walls at 2 steps right and 3 step up are probably on the opposite side. So moving left should be possible.

Therefore, the best action now is to move left to get closer to the ""stop"" text block. Alternatively, move up if possible. But I think moving left is the first step to reach the ""stop"" block.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the key which is labeled as a win, but in the active rules, it says ""key is win"", so grabbing the key should win the level. But first, I need to navigate from where Baba is.

Looking at the current observation, Baba's position is at rule `baba` which is 3 steps to the left. The other rules are `is` 2 steps left and `you` 1 step left. So Baba is at (3 left). The key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. There are walls around, some marked as stop. 

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move unless I hit a wall. The key is down a bit. Let me check the path. To the right of Baba (3 left), there's a wall 2 steps to the right. Wait, no—the objects list has wall 2 steps to the right. So moving right from Baba's position (3 left) would take me towards the wall. But the key is at 4 steps right and 1 up. Maybe I need to move down first? 

Wait, the current position of Baba is 3 steps left. The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. So from Baba's position, moving right three times would get to the key's x-coordinate, but the y-coordinate is 1 up. So need to move up first? But there's a wall 3 steps up from the original position? Let me parse the objects again.

Looking at the objects: there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 5 step up. Then lower down, at 4 step up, there's a ball. Then at 3 step up, a wall. So moving up from Baba's position (3 left) would hit walls at 5, 4, 3 steps up? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the walls are positioned relative to where? Maybe the map is laid out with Baba's position as a reference. 

Assuming Baba is at position (0,0), then the objects are relative to that. For example, rule `wall` 3 step to the left would be at (-3, 0). The wall 2 steps to the right and 5 step up is at (2,5). The key is at (4,1). The current active rules are wall is stop, so any object named wall can't be passed. 

So the path from Baba's position (3 left, which is (-3,0)) to the key at (4,1) needs to avoid walls. Let's see possible routes. Moving right towards the key, but there's a wall at (2,5), which is way above. The walls closer are at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). So moving up from (-3,0) to (4,1) would require going up to at least y=1. But moving up from y=0 to y=1 is possible if there's no wall there. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (2,3), but that's to the right. Maybe the path is blocked by walls higher up, but the direct path to the key is right and up. 

Wait, the key is at (4,1). So from Baba at (-3,0), moving right 7 steps to x=4, and up 1 step to y=1. But the way might be blocked. Let's check the walls. There's a wall at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), and others. But between y=0 and y=1, the only obstacle might be the walls at x=2, but y=0 is the starting point. So moving right from x=-3 to x=4 would pass through x=-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. At y=0, the wall is at x=2. So when moving right past x=2 on y=0, there's a wall. So can't go straight right along y=0. 

Therefore, need to move up first to y=1, then go right. But can Baba move up? Let's see. The active rules are wall is stop. The only wall immediately above would be at y=1. Looking at the objects, there's a key at (4,1), and a wall at (2,1 step up)? Wait, no. The objects list has wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So that's at (2,1). So moving up from (-3,0) to (2,1) is a wall. So can't go that way. 

Alternative route: move up to avoid the wall at (2,1). But where? Let's check the map again. At y=5, there are walls up high, but maybe lower up. For example, at y=2 step up, there's a rule `ball` at (1,2). Then at y=3 step up, a wall at (2,3). So maybe moving up to y=2, then right. 

From (-3,0), move up to y=2. Is there a wall there? At (2,3) is a wall, but y=2 is clear except for the rule `ball` at (1,2). So moving up to y=2, then right past x=1 to x=4. But how to get past the wall at x=2 on lower y levels. 

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules. Since the rules are text blocks, perhaps moving the ""key is win"" rule somewhere else, but the active rules are already key is win. The goal is to grab the key, so maybe just move towards it, but the path is blocked. 

Wait, the current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So as Baba, you can move unless blocked by a wall. The key is at (4,1), which is a win condition. So the plan is to reach the key. The problem is the path. 

Looking at the objects again: rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left (so at (-3,0)), rule `is` 2 steps left (at (-2,0)), rule `you` 1 step left (at (-1,0)). Then there's a wall at (2,0), which is 2 steps to the right of Baba's position. So moving right from Baba's position, the first obstacle is the wall at (2,0). So can't go straight right. 

So need to move around the wall. Maybe up then right. From (-3,0), move up to y=1. But as mentioned, there's a wall at (2,1). So that's blocked. Move up to y=2. At y=2, moving right past x=1 to x=4. Let's see if there are walls along y=2. At y=2 step up, there's a wall at (2,2). So moving right past x=2 on y=2 is blocked. So can't go that way. 

Alternative: move down. From (-3,0), move down to y=-1. Are there walls there? Looking at objects, there's a wall at (2,1 step down), which would be (2,-1). So moving down to y=-1, then right. But at (2,-1), there's a wall. Hmm. 

Wait, the objects list includes wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is (2,-1). So moving down from y=0 to y=-1, but x is still -3. Then moving right, when reaching x=2, there's a wall. So that's blocked. 

Another approach: use the rule pieces to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""baba is you"" rule to make Baba have another property. But to do that, need to move the text blocks. 

The available rules are: rule `wall` 3 left, rule `is` 2 left, rule `stop` 1 left. Then lower down, rule `baba` 3 left, rule `is` 2 left, rule `you` 1 left. And rule `ball` 1 right and 2 up. 

If I can move the ""you"" rule to attach to Baba, making ""baba is you"" explicit. Currently, the active rule is ""baba is you"" because the rule `baba` is connected to `is` and `you`. So maybe that's already set. 

Alternatively, to change the win condition. The active rule is ""key is win"". If I can replace that with ""baba is win"", then touching the key wouldn't be necessary, but just being Baba would win. But how? The key is still needed, but maybe the solution is to make Baba the win. 

To do that, I need to create a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the relevant text blocks. For example, take the ""win"" rule which is at 7 steps right and 3 step up, and attach it to ""baba"". 

But to move those text blocks, I have to navigate to them without hitting walls. Let's see. The ""win"" rule is at (7,3) if Baba is at (0,0). To get there, from (-3,0), need to move right 10 steps and up 3. But the path is blocked by walls at various points. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left. So the text blocks for ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" are at (-3,0), (-2,0), (-1,0). The ""win"" rule is at (7,3). The ""key"" is at (4,1). 

To create ""baba is win"", need to connect ""baba"" with ""win"" using an ""is"" rule. The existing ""is"" rules are at (-2,0) and (2 left, 1 down). Maybe move the ""is"" from (-2,0) to between ""baba"" and ""win"". But how to move them? 

To move a text block, you have to push it, likely by moving into it from an adjacent space, provided you're not stopped. Since Baba is a ""you"" object, can move unless stopped by walls. So maybe move right towards the ""is"" rule at (-2,0), then move it. 

Wait, the ""is"" rule is at 2 steps left of Baba's position, which is (-2,0). So Baba is at (-3,0), ""is"" is at (-2,0). So moving right once would take Baba to (-2,0), which is the ""is"" rule. Then, to move the ""is"" rule, you have to push it. So from (-2,0), move right again, which would push the ""is"" rule to (0,0). Then, from (0,0), move right to (1,0), pushing ""is"" to (1,0). Continue moving right until ""is"" is next to ""baba"" or ""win"". 

But first, need to navigate past the wall at (2,0). Let's see. From Baba at (-3,0), move right to (-2,0) which is the ""is"" rule. Then move right again to (0,0), pushing ""is"" there. Then move right to (1,0), pushing ""is"" to (1,0). Then move right to (2,0), but there's a wall. So can't go beyond that. 

Alternatively, move up after getting the ""is"" rule. From (-3,0) to (-2,0) (the ""is""), then move up to (-2,1). Then move right, pushing ""is"" up. But not sure. 

This seems complicated. Alternatively, focus on reaching the key. The key is at (4,1). The path might be to move up to y=1, but there's a wall at (2,1). So maybe move up to y=2, then right. From (-3,0) move up to (-3,2). Is there a wall there? Looking at objects, at (2,3) there's a wall, but y=2 is clear except for the rule `ball` at (1,2). So moving up to (-3,2), then right. 

But moving right from (-3,2) past x=1 to x=4. At x=2 on y=2, there's a wall. So can't go past x=2. Hmm. 

Another idea: use the ball. There's a ball at (4,3 step up), which is (4,3). The rule `ball` is at (1,2). Not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, change the ""ball is stop"" or something. But the current rules don't have that. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. 

Maybe the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule somewhere else, but that doesn't make sense. Or create a new rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, need to have ""baba"" connected to ""win"" with an ""is"". 

The ""win"" rule is at (7,3). To get there, Baba would need to move right 10 steps and up 3, but there are walls in the way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is not necessary if we make Baba the win. So create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". But how? 

The ""win"" rule is at (7,3). The ""baba"" rule is at (-3,0). The distance is huge, and walls block the path. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is a red herring, and the real win condition is touching the key, but the way is blocked. So maybe the solution is to push the key towards Baba by moving adjacent objects. 

But the key is at (4,1). To move it, you have to be able to push it, which requires the ""key"" to not have a ""stop"" property. Currently, ""wall is stop"", so other objects like key are movable unless specified otherwise. 

So maybe move right towards the key, but navigate around the walls. Let's see. From (-3,0), move up to y=1. But blocked by wall at (2,1). Move up to y=2. At y=2, there's a wall at (2,2). So can't go right past x=2. Move up to y=3. At y=3, there's a wall at (2,3). Still blocked. Move up to y=4. At y=4, a ball is present but not a wall. So from (-3,4), move right. At x=2, y=4, is there a wall? Looking at objects, at (2,5) there's a wall, but y=4 is clear. So move right past x=2 on y=4. Then reach the key at (4,1). Wait, no, the key is at (4,1), not (4,4). 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that by moving the ""key is win"" rule, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, the key is at (4,1), and to get there, you have to move down from higher up. For example, from (4,5) where the rule `win` is, move down to (4,1). But how to get there. 

Alternatively, consider that the ""key is win"" rule means that picking up the key makes you win. So maybe the solution is to push the key to Baba's position. To do that, move towards the key, but avoid walls. 

From (-3,0), move right to (-2,0) (the ""is"" rule), then move right to (0,0), pushing ""is"" there. Then move right to (1,0), pushing ""is"" to (1,0). Now, ""is"" is at (1,0). Then move up to (1,1). Then move right to (2,1), but there's a wall. So can't. 

Alternatively, move up from (1,0) to (1,1), then right to (2,1) (wall), blocked. 

This is tricky. Maybe the correct action is to move down towards the key. From (-3,0), move down to (-3,-1). Is there a wall there? The objects list has wall 2 steps right and 1 step down, which is (2,-1). So at (-3,-1), no wall. Move down to (-3,-1), then right. 

But moving right from (-3,-1) to (-2,-1), then (-1,-1), (0,-1), (1,-1), (2,-1) which is a wall. So stuck again. 

Another approach: use the ""ball"" rule. The rule `ball` is at (1,2). If I can make ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win"", but that might not help. 

Alternatively, change the ""stop"" property. If I can make ""wall is not stop"", then walls can be passed. But how? The active rule is ""wall is stop"". To change that, need to move the ""stop"" rule. 

The ""stop"" rule is at (1 step to the left and 3 step up), which is (-1,3). To move it, need to navigate there. From (-3,0), move up to (-3,3), then left to (-4,3), but there's no rule there. The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,3). So from (-3,0), move up 3 steps to (-3,3), then left 2 steps to (-5,3), but that's not where the ""stop"" rule is. 

This is getting too complex. Maybe the intended solution is to move right three times to reach the key, but the path is blocked. Wait, the key is at (4,1). From Baba at (-3,0), moving right 7 steps and up 1 step. But the obstacles are walls at x=2 on various y levels. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the key towards Baba. Since keys are movable, maybe move the key by pushing it from its position (4,1) towards Baba. But to do that, need to be adjacent to the key and move in the direction opposite to where you want to push it. 

The key is at (4,1). To push it left, you need to be","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation.

The active rules are still ""wall is stop,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" So normally, if I touch a wall, I can't move through it. The key is the win condition, so getting to the key should let me win. But I need to check where everything is located.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a rule `baba` 3 steps to the left. So the baba text block is positioned to the left of my current position.
- The `is` and `you` rules are 2 and 1 steps to the left, respectively. So combining those, it looks like the rule ""baba is you"" is formed by the `baba` text block 3 steps left, `is` 2 steps left, and `you` 1 step left. That makes sense because each rule is connected by being adjacent.

But wait, the player is controlled by Baba, right? Since ""baba is you,"" moving Baba around would allow me to interact with other objects. The goal is to get the key, which is win. So the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up.

However, there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 2 steps right at 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 steps up, and down. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Also, the rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. Maybe the ball can be used to break walls or change rules?

Wait, the rule ""key is win"" means that touching the key makes you win. So the plan is to reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are defined as ""stop,"" so I can't move through them. However, in Baba Is You, you can change rules by moving text blocks. So maybe I can rearrange the rules to make walls not stop, or make the key not a win, or make something else a win.

Alternatively, maybe I can push objects. But the problem says you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. The current rules have ""wall is stop,"" so any wall is a STOP, meaning I can't move through them or push them. But other objects like the key, ball, or text blocks (if they're not stop) can be moved.

Looking at the objects:

- The `ball` rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up. So if I can move that ball, maybe I can use it to break a wall or interact with something else. But how?

Wait, the ""ball"" is a text block that says ""ball is..."" something. But in the current active rules, the only active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the ball's rule isn't active yet. If I can change the rule to make ball be something else, like ""ball is push"" or ""ball is win,"" that might help.

But to do that, I need to move the `ball` text block and combine it with the `is` and `win` or other rules. Let's see where the `is` and other text blocks are.

The `is` rules are scattered: at 2 left and 5 up, 6 right and 5 up, etc. The `win` rule is at 7 right and 5 up. The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So maybe if I can move the `ball` text block next to an `is` and then to a `win` or another property, I can create a new rule like ""ball is win,"" making the ball itself the win condition. That way, I could go get the ball instead of the key.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball a stop, then maybe I can use it to block or unblock paths. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push other objects. But walls are stop, so I can't push them. However, the key is not a stop, so maybe I can move the key. But the key is at 4 right and 1 up, which is behind a wall at 2 right and 1 up. So unless I can move that wall, I can't get past it.

Wait, the wall at 2 right and 1 up is a stop. But if I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, then the wall wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the `wall` text block and the `is` and `stop` text blocks.

The `wall` rule is at 3 left and 5 up. The `is` rule is at 2 left and 5 up. The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So maybe if I can move the `wall` text block away from the `is` and `stop`, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. For example, if I move the `wall` text block to a different position, then the original rule would no longer be connected, thereby removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. That would make walls not stop, allowing me to walk through them.

But how to do that? Let's see. The `wall` text block is 3 steps left. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Since I'm Baba (controlled by ""baba is you""), I can move left, right, up, or down, unless blocked by a stop.

Currently, where is the player located? The observation doesn't explicitly say where Baba is, but the rules and objects are positioned relative to something. Maybe the player is at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 3 steps left. Wait, the `rule `baba` is at 3 step to the left. So if I'm controlling Baba, my position is at the `baba` text block, which is 3 steps left from wherever the reference point is. But the exact coordinates are a bit unclear without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is positioned at the location of the `baba` text block. So if the `baba` rule is 3 steps left, then moving right would bring me towards the center.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The walls are to the right and up. If I can move right past the walls, but they are stops. So unless I can change the rules, I can't.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba able to move through walls. For example, if I can form a rule like ""baba is not stop"" or ""baba is win."" But to do that, I need to move the relevant text blocks.

The `is` rules are available. For instance, there's an `is` at 2 left and 5 up, another at 6 right and 5 up, etc. The `you` rule is at 1 left and 2 steps down. The `win` rule is at 7 right and 5 up.

If I can move the `baba` text block to be next to an `is` and then to a `win`, that would create ""baba is win,"" making touching Baba itself a win condition. But that seems tricky because the `baba` rule is already part of the ""baba is you"" rule.

Wait, the existing rules are ""baba is you,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""key is win."" So the `baba` text block is connected to `is` and `you`. To create a new rule like ""baba is win,"" I need to move the `baba` text block away from the current ""baba is you"" rule and then connect it to `is` and `win`.

So, the steps could be:

1. Move the `baba` text block (which is 3 steps left) to a new position.
2. Find an `is` text block and a `win` text block and place the `baba` next to them to form ""baba is win.""

But how to move the `baba` text block? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move in the four directions. The `baba` text block is located at 3 steps left. If I move right, I can go towards the center. Let's assume the player is at the `baba` text block's position. So moving right would be towards the direction where other objects are.

Looking at the objects, there's a `rule `is` at 2 steps left and 5 steps up. The `baba` rule is at 3 steps left. So if I move left from the `baba` position, I can reach the `is` at 2 steps left. But I need to see if that's possible without being blocked.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. For example, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up. But if I'm starting at 3 steps left, moving right would be towards the center. Let's think in terms of coordinates. Maybe the map has a grid where each step is a position. The `baba` rule is at (0,0), for example, and other objects are relative to that. But without a visual, it's a bit abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the `baba` text block, which is 3 steps left. To move towards the `is` at 2 steps left, I would move left again. But I need to check if there are any walls blocking that path.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up, but that's to the right of the center. If I'm moving left from the `baba` position (3 left), moving left again would be to 4 left, which might not have walls. The walls are more towards the right side.

Alternatively, moving right from the `baba` position (3 left) would head towards the center. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up, but that's upwards. Maybe the path down is clearer.

This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map. Let's try to outline possible actions based on the available text blocks.

The key is at 4 right, 1 up. To get there, need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 2 right, 1 up (stop). So unless that wall is removed or becomes non-stop, can't go through.

Alternative path: move around the walls. But the walls are vertically aligned. Maybe there's a way to go around them by moving down or up.

Alternatively, use the ball to break the wall. If the ball can be made into a tool, like ""ball is push,"" then maybe pushing the ball into the wall could destroy it. But first, need to create that rule.

To create ""ball is push,"" I need to move the `ball` text block next to an `is` and then to a `push` rule. But I don't see a `push` rule in the active rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. Other rules like push might be present as text blocks but inactive.

Looking at the objects, the `rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. So the ball's definition is there, but it's not active. If I can move that `ball` text block next to an `is` and a `push` (if such a text block exists), then ""ball is push"" would be created. But the current observation doesn't mention a `push` text block. Hmm.

Wait, the active rules are only wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So other properties like push or free might be present as text blocks but not active. For example, maybe there's a `rule `push` somewhere on the map that's inactive because it's not connected to an `is`.

Looking at the objects listed, I don't see any `push` rule mentioned. The rules present are wall, is, stop, key, win, baba, you. So perhaps the available text blocks are limited to those. In that case, creating a ""ball is push"" rule isn't possible unless there's a `push` text block that's not listed here, which doesn't seem to be the case.

Alternative idea: make the key a stop, so it blocks the path, but that doesn't help. Or make the key a different property. But the goal is to get to the key, so making it a stop is counterproductive.

Wait, the active rule is ""key is win,"" so touching the key wins. If I can change that to ""key is stop,"" then the key becomes a wall, but that would block my path, which isn't helpful. Unless there's another way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can make myself (Baba) a win. Since ""baba is you,"" if I can create a rule ""baba is win,"" then just standing on Baba would make me win. But how?

To do that, I need to move the `baba` text block away from its current connection to `you` and reconnect it to `win`. The current ""baba is you"" is formed by the `baba` text block at 3 left, `is` at 2 left, and `you` at 1 left. So if I move the `baba` text block to a new position, then connect it to `is` and `win`, that would create ""baba is win.""

So the steps would be:

1. Move the `baba` text block from 3 left to a new location.
2. Place it next to an `is` rule and a `win` rule to form ""baba is win.""

But how to move the `baba` text block? Since I'm Baba, I can move in any direction, unless blocked by a stop. The current path might be blocked, but perhaps there's a way.

Looking at the map, the `baba` text block is at 3 left. If I move right, I can go towards the center. The walls are at 2 right and 5 up, but that's upwards. Moving right from 3 left would take me to 2 left, then 1 left, etc. Is there a wall in the way?

There's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 step up, but that's up and to the right. If I'm moving right from 3 left, I'd be going towards 2 left, then 1 left, etc., which might be clear.

So, possible actions:

- Move right to get closer to the `is` and `win` rules.
- Once nearby, move the `baba` text block to a position where it can be connected to `is` and `win`.

But the problem is that the `baba` text block is part of the existing ""baba is you"" rule. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that separates it from the `you` rule.

For example, if the `baba` is at 3 left, connected to `is` at 2 left and `you` at 1 left, moving the `baba` text block one step to the right (to 2 left) would break the ""baba is you"" rule, but then I can reconnect it to `is` at 2 left and `win` somewhere else.

But where is the `win` rule? It's at 7 right and 5 up. That's quite far from the `baba`'s initial position.

Alternatively, maybe there's a `win` text block closer. Looking at the objects, the `win` rule is at 7 right and 5 up. That's quite to the right and up. So moving the `baba` text block all the way there would be difficult, especially with walls in the way.

Another approach: use the existing `key` as the win. The key is at 4 right and 1 up. If I can reach it, that's the goal. But the path is blocked by a stop wall at 2 right and 1 up.

If I can remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the `wall` text block away from the `is` and `stop` rules.

The `wall` rule is at 3 left and 5 up. The `is` rule is at 2 left and 5 up. The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up. So the ""wall is stop"" rule is formed by `wall` at 3 left, `is` at 2 left, and `stop` at 1 left. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Typically, a rule is formed by three adjacent text blocks: [Subject] IS [Property]. So ""wall is stop"" would be `wall` text block next to `is`, next to `stop`.

Looking at the positions:

- `wall` is at 3 step left and 5 step up.
- `is` is at 2 step left and 5 step up.
- `stop` is at 1 step left and 3 step up.

These are not adjacent. The `wall` and `is` are adjacent horizontally (3 left and 5 up next to 2 left and 5 up), but the `stop` is at 1 left and 3 up, which is vertically below and to the left. So the original ""wall is stop"" rule might not be properly formed, or maybe the positions are different.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Maybe I should try to move the `wall` text block to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

If I can move the `wall` text block away from the `is` and `stop`, then the rule would be broken. For example, if the `wall` text block is no longer adjacent to `is` and `stop`, then ""wall is stop"" is no longer a rule.

The `wall` text block is at 3 left, 5 up. If I move it down or to the side, perhaps I can separate it from the `is` at 2 left, 5 up. Moving the `wall` one step to the right (to 2 left, 5 up) would place it next to the `is`, but that would still keep the ""wall is stop"" rule if the `stop` is somehow connected. Wait, but the `stop` is at 1 left, 3 up, which is not adjacent to the `wall` and `is` at 3 and 2 left, 5 up. So maybe the original rule is not properly connected,","

Let's take a look at this level. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. That means I, being Baba, can move through anything except walls since they're stop. The goal is to get to the key, which is defined as win, so grabbing the key should solve the level.

Now, looking at the objects on the map. There's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall right at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Wait, the key is at 4 steps right, 1 step up. So the path from Baba's current position (3 steps left) to the key might be blocked. Let me map this out.

Baba is at 3 steps to the left. The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. So to reach the key, I need to move right multiple times and up. But along the way, there's a wall at 2 steps right, 1 step up. Also, the rule ""ball is you"" is present. Wait, the rule ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up might be a text block. Let me check the objects again.

There's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 2 step up. Hmm. So if I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can change the properties. But the ball itself is an object, and if I move it, does that affect anything? The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The ball has a rule attached to it saying ""ball is you""? Wait, no, the rule `ball` is 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So that's a text block ""BALL IS YOU""? Or is it a separate rule? Wait, the objects list has ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". So that means there's a text block ""BALL IS YOU"" located at that position. 

So if I can move that text block, I could potentially change the rules. For example, if I move ""BALL IS YOU"" next to the key, then key could become ""YOU"" or something else. But my goal is to get to the key, which is defined as ""WIN"". Since key is win, I just need to reach it. But the problem is the walls blocking the path. Let's see the path:

Baba is at 3 steps left. To get to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step up, the path would be: move right three times to get to the same x-coordinate as the key (since the key is 4 steps right from Baba's initial position?), wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. Wait, the observation says Baba is at 3 steps to the left. So if I move right, each step brings me closer. Let me visualize:

Current position: 3 steps left.

Objects:

- The key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up.

- There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So if I try to go right from Baba's position, first step right would be to 2 steps left, then next to 1 step left, then to Baba's original position (0 steps left?), wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider the grid layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is located in a position that's reachable by moving right and up, but the walls are in the way. The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is directly below the key. So to get to the key, I need to move around that wall. But how?

The rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. Maybe I can move that rule to create a new rule. For example, if I can move ""BALL IS YOU"" next to the key, then the key would become ""YOU"", but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can move ""BALL IS YOU"" to create a new rule like ""KEY IS WIN"" again, but that's already the case.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the key is already win. So the goal is to reach the key. The problem is the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the path again.

Baba is at 3 steps left. To get to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step up:

Possible path:

1. Move right to 2 steps left.

2. Move right to 1 step left.

3. Move right to Baba's original position (0 steps left?).

But then up to 1 step up, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe the coordinates are different. Let me parse the objects again.

Objects:

- rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 3 step up: So a text block ""WALL IS STOP"" is 3 left, 3 up.

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: A wall object at 2 right, 3 up.

- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up: Text block ""KEY IS WIN"" at 5 right, 3 up.

And so on. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So the key's position is 4 right, 1 up. The wall blocking the path is at 2 right, 1 up. So between Baba (3 left) and the key (4 right, 1 up), the path would require moving right past the wall at 2 right, 1 up.

But how? The wall is a STOP, so I can't move through it. So I need to find a way around. Maybe by moving the wall's rule? The rule `wall` is at 3 left, 3 up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, perhaps the wall at 2 right, 1 up would no longer be a stop. But how to do that?

To move a rule, I need to be adjacent to it and it shouldn't be STOP. The rule `wall` is at 3 left, 3 up. If I can get to that position, maybe I can move it. But moving there requires navigating around other objects.

Alternatively, the rule `ball` is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move that rule to create a new rule that changes something. For example, if I move ""BALL IS YOU"" next to the key, then the key would become YOU, but that doesn't help unless I can become the key. But since ""baba is you"", I'm already you. So if the key is win, and I can touch it, that's the goal.

Wait, maybe the key is not reachable because of the wall. So perhaps I need to redefine the key's property. The active rule is ""key is win"", so even if I can't reach the key, if I can make another object be win, that might work. But the goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key here.

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be made into a win. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule next to the ball, then ball becomes win. Let's see. The ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The ball is at 4 right, 4 up. So if I can move the ""key is win"" rule down to the ball's position, then the ball would be win. Then I could go to the ball instead.

But how to move that rule. To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and it's not STOP. The ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. Is that a STOP? No, because the rule is ""key is win"", and walls are stop. So that rule is movable. If I can move that rule down to the ball's location, then the ball becomes win. Then I can go to the ball instead.

But how to navigate there. Let's think step by step.

First, from Baba's position at 3 left, I need to move right to reach the area where the rules are. Let's see:

Current position: 3 left.

To get to the ""key is win"" rule at 5 right, 3 up, I need to move right 8 steps (from 3 left to 5 right is 8 steps right), but there are walls in the way. For example, at 2 right, 1 up is a wall. So this path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe moving the ""ball is you"" rule to create a new rule. The ""ball is you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move that next to the key, then perhaps the key becomes you. But ""baba is you"" is already active, so I'm you. If the key is you, then touching it would win. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so it's still win. So unless I can change both rules.

Alternatively, move the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else. If I can remove the wall's stop property, then the wall becomes movable. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 3 up. If I move that rule, say down to the wall's position, then the wall's property is removed, making it passable.

So here's a possible plan:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 3 left, 3 up.

2. Pick it up and move it away, so the wall no longer has the stop property.

3. Then navigate around the wall to the key.

But how to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. From Baba's position at 3 left, moving right 3 steps would get to the ""wall is stop"" rule's x-coordinate (3 left to 0, then 3 right?), but need to consider the grid layout. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should focus on moving the ""ball is you"" rule to create a new rule.

Another angle: The rule ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" is a text block ""BALL IS YOU"" located at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move this rule next to the key, which is at 4 right, 1 up, perhaps I can create a new rule like ""KEY IS YOU"" or ""KEY IS WIN"". Wait, but the key is already win. If I move ""BALL IS YOU"" next to the key, does that make the key you? But ""baba is you"" is already active, so I'm you. If the key is win, touching it would win. So maybe that's not necessary.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball win. If I move the ""key is win"" rule to the ball's position, then the ball becomes win. Let's see: the ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The ball is at 4 right, 4 up. So moving the ""key is win"" rule down one step and left one step would place it on the ball. But how to move it there.

To move the ""key is win"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. The rule is at 5 right, 3 up. From there, I can move it left, right, up, or down. Let's say I move it down to 5 right, 4 up. Then left to 4 right, 4 up, which is where the ball is. Then the ball would have the ""win"" property. Then I can go to the ball instead of the key.

But to do that, I need to navigate to the ""key is win"" rule's location. From Baba's starting position at 3 left, how to get to 5 right, 3 up. There are walls in the way. For example, at 2 right, 1 up is a wall. So moving right past that would be blocked.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: use the ""ball is you"" rule to become the ball. If I can move the ""ball is you"" rule to be on top of Baba, then Baba becomes ball. Then, if there's a rule that allows balls to move through walls, but there isn't. The only rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So becoming a ball wouldn't help unless there's a hidden rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball a stop, but that's not helpful.

Wait, the rule `ball` is a text block ""BALL IS YOU"" located at 1 right, 2 up. If I can move this text block to create a new rule, like ""BALL IS WIN"", then the ball would be win. But how. Let me think.

If I move the ""BALL IS YOU"" rule next to the ball object, then the rule would apply to the ball. So the ball would become you, but it's already you via the ""ball is you"" rule. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, move the ""BALL IS YOU"" rule next to the key to make the key you. But again, since Baba is you, touching the key (which is win) would win.

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to redefine the key's property. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position, then create a new rule that makes the ball win. Let's see.

If I move the ""key is win"" rule to the ball's location, then the ball becomes win. Then I can go to the ball. But to move the ""key is win"" rule, I need to pathfind to its location, which is at 5 right, 3 up. From Baba's position at 3 left, moving right 8 steps (passing through walls) isn't feasible.

Alternatively, use other rules. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are present. For example, there's a rule `is` at 2 left, 2 down. Maybe I can combine rules. If I can create a new rule like ""KEY IS BALL"", then the key would be a ball, and if balls have a different property, but I don't think so.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. There's no rule defining ball's properties except ""ball is you"". So balls can be moved unless there's a stop rule on them. But the ball itself is not a stop.

So if I can reach the ball, since it's not a stop, I can move it. But the goal is to reach the key, which is win. Maybe there's a way to make the ball win by redefining the rules.

Another idea: Use the ""rule `is`"" blocks to create new rules. For example, if I can create ""BALL IS WIN"", then the ball would be win. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule and the ""win"" rule.

Looking at the objects:

- There's a ""rule `is`"" at 6 right, 5 up (the one next to ""win"") and another at 2 left, 2 down.

If I can move the ""win"" rule (which is part of ""key is win"") to be next to the ""ball"" rule and an ""is"" rule, then I can create ""BALL IS WIN"".

The ""win"" rule is part of the ""key is win"" text block, which is at 7 right, 5 up. So the ""win"" part is separate? Wait, no. The text block ""KEY IS WIN"" is a single rule, so moving it would move the entire rule. To create a new rule ""BALL IS WIN"", I need to have the ""ball"", ""is"", and ""win"" rules adjacent in the correct order.

So perhaps:

1. Move the ""win"" rule (from ""key is win"") to be next to the ""ball"" rule and an ""is"" rule.

For example, move the ""win"" rule from 7 right, 5 up to 4 right, 4 up (where the ball is), and place an ""is"" rule in between.

But this requires manipulating multiple rules, which might be complex.

Alternatively, since the ball already has the ""is you"" rule, maybe combining that with another rule.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""wall is stop"" rule away to remove the stop property from the wall blocking the path.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule located at 3 left, 3 up.

2. Pick it up and move it down or to the side, so the wall at 2 right, 1 up no longer has the stop property.

3. Now, navigate around the wall to the key at 4 right, 1 up.

But how to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. From Baba's starting position at 3 left, moving right 3 steps to get to the rule's x-coordinate (3 left to 0, then 3 right?), but there are walls in the way. For example, at 2 right, 1 up is a wall. So moving right directly isn't possible.

Alternative path: Move up first to avoid the wall. Let's see.

From Baba's position at 3 left, move up to 3 left, 1 up. Then move right. But need to check the map.

Looking at the objects:

- At 2 right, 1 up is a wall (stop).

- The key is at 4 right, 1 up.

So if I move up to 3 left, 1 up, then I'm at the same level as the wall. Moving right from there would hit the wall.

Hmm. Maybe need to move up more. For example, move up to 3 left, 2 up. Then move right past the wall.

But the wall at 2 right, 1 up is below, so moving up might allow bypassing it.

Wait, the wall at 2 right, 1 up is directly below the key. If I can get to the key's position (4 right, 1 up) by moving around the wall from above or below.

But the key is at 1 step up, so moving down from there isn't helpful.

Alternatively, move up to 3 left, 4 up, then move right. But that's a long way.

This is tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that by moving the ""ball is you"" rule next to the key, you can make the key you, but since Baba is already you, touching the key (which is win) would work. But how to move that rule.

The ""ball is you"" rule is at 1 right, 2 up. The key is at 4 right, 1 up. So moving the ""ball is you"" rule to the key's location would create ""KEY IS YOU"", but the key is already win. However, if the key is both you and win, touching it would win.

I'm trying to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let's look at the current observation again. The active rules are still ""wall is stop,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" That means touching a wall stops me, the key is what I need to get to win, and since Baba is You, any rule that applies to Baba also applies to me.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left."" So that's a text block saying ""BABA IS YOU,"" which is the default rule. Then there's a ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" one step to the left of that. Also, there's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall to the right and some other structures blocking the path. 

The goal is to reach the key, which is win, right? Wait, no—the active rule says ""key is win,"" so getting the key makes it the win condition. But normally, you need to reach the win object. Wait, maybe the key itself is the win object here. So I need to get to the key. But the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. However, there's a wall to the right at various positions. Let me map this out.

I'm probably starting at the position where the ""rule `baba`"" is located, 3 steps to the left. So my current position is 3 steps left of the ""baba"" rule. To get to the key, which is 4 steps right and 1 step up from the ""baba"" rule, I need to move right multiple times. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 5 steps up, then more walls down. Wait, maybe the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects list:

- rule `wall` 3 left, 5 up
- rule `is` 2 left, 5 up
- rule `stop` 1 left, 5 up
- wall 2 right, 5 up
- rule `key` 5 right, 5 up
- rule `is` 6 right, 5 up
- rule `win` 7 right, 5 up
- wall 2 right, 4 up
- ball 4 right, 4 up
- wall 2 right, 3 up
- rule `ball` 1 right, 2 up
- wall 2 right, 2 up
- wall 2 right, 1 up
- key 4 right, 1 up
- rule `baba` 3 left
- rule `is` 2 left
- rule `you` 1 left
- wall 2 right
- wall 2 right, 1 down

Hmm. So starting from the ""rule baba"" at 3 left, if I go right, there's a wall 2 steps to the right. Wait, but the ""wall 2 steps to the right"" is at the same level as the key? Let me visualize this. Maybe it's a grid where each position has coordinates. Let's assume the initial position is (0,0).

The ""rule `baba`"" is at (-3, 0) because it's 3 steps to the left. The ""wall 2 steps to the right"" would be at (2, 0). But there's also a wall at (2,1), (2,2), etc. So if I try to move right from my starting position (-3,0), moving to (0,0), but there's a wall at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), etc. So directly moving right to reach the key at (4,1) is blocked by walls. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules. The key is at (4,1), which is win because ""key is win."" So if I can reach the key, I win. But how to get past the walls. The walls are defined as ""wall is stop,"" so touching them stops me. So I need to find a path around the walls or manipulate the rules to make the walls not stop me.

Looking at the available text blocks: there's a ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" So if I can move that text block somewhere to create a new rule. For example, if I combine ""ball is you"" or ""ball is stop"" or something. But how?

Since Baba is You, I can move any text block that isn't stopped. The walls are stop, so any text block attached to a wall or in a stopped position can't be moved. Let's check which text blocks are movable. The ""rule `baba`"" at (-3,0) is separate from the walls. The ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" at (-2,0) and (-1,0) are also separate. The ""rule `ball`"" at (1,1) is also separate. So maybe I can move that ""rule `ball`"" to create a new rule.

For example, if I move the ""rule `ball`"" to create ""ball is stop,"" then the ball would become a stop, which might block me, but if I make ""ball is you,"" then I could merge with the ball. Alternatively, maybe ""ball is win"" to change the win condition. But the key is already the win condition. 

Wait, the active rules are ""wall is stop,"" ""key is win,"" and ""baba is you."" So if I can change ""key is win"" to something else, maybe ""you is win,"" then I could just touch myself (Baba) to win. But to do that, I need to move the ""key is win"" rule. The ""rule `key`"" is at (5,5), which is up high. To reach there, I'd have to navigate past the walls, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used. If I make ""ball is you,"" then touching the ball would make me you, but I'm already you. Hmm, not sure. Or ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it win. The ball is at (4,4), but there's a wall at (2,4), so path might be blocked.

Another idea: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""rule `baba`"" text block to create a new rule. For example, moving it to say ""baba is win,"" then touching myself would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule. The current ""rule `baba`"" is at (-3,0). If I can move it to a different position and change it to ""baba is win,"" that could work. However, moving the rule requires that it's not blocked. The path from (-3,0) to, say, (3 step left and 2 steps down) where the ""rule `you`"" is located? Wait, the ""rule `you`"" is at (-1,0). So maybe moving the ""rule `baba`"" to adjacent positions.

But how to move it? Each action is moving left, right, up, down. If I'm at (-3,0), moving right would take me to (-2,0), which is where the ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`"" are. But those positions might be occupied by other text blocks or walls. Wait, the ""wall 2 steps to the right"" is at (2,0), which is further right. So from (-3,0), moving right step by step: (-2,0), (-1,0), (0,0), (1,0), etc., but need to check if those positions are blocked.

At (-2,0), there's a ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`."" Are those movable? Since the rules are ""wall is stop,"" but these are text blocks, not walls. So if I can move them. For example, if I move the ""rule `baba`"" from (-3,0) to (-2,0), but that position already has ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`."" Can multiple text blocks be in the same position? Probably not, as they might stack, but in Baba Is You, usually, you can't have overlapping text blocks. So maybe I need to move the existing ones first.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at (4,1), which is down and to the right. Let's see the path from (-3,0) to (4,1). The direct path is right four steps and down one step. But there's a wall at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), etc. So moving right past (2,0) is blocked. Maybe go around via up or down.

If I go up from (-3,0) to (-3,1), but is there a way up? The ""wall 2 steps to the right and 5 step up"" is at (2,5). Not sure. Let me check the map again. The walls are at various positions up high, but maybe there's a path upwards that's open.

Alternatively, use the ball. The ball is at (4,4), but there's a wall at (2,4). So path from (4,4) to (4,1) is down three steps, but the wall at (2,4) blocks the way. Maybe if I make the ball a stop, but how?

Another approach: Since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push objects. In Baba Is You, sometimes you can push objects if they're not stopped. But the key is the win object, and pushing it might be necessary. But the key is at (4,1), and there's a wall at (2,1). So to push the key, I need to be next to it and move in a direction, but the wall is blocking the path.

Wait, the key is at (4,1), and there's a wall at (2,1). So from (4,1), to get past the wall at (2,1), I need to go around. But how? Maybe go up to (4,2), but there's a wall at (2,2). This seems tricky.

Let me think about manipulating the rules. If I can create a rule that makes walls not stop me, then I could walk through them. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is not stop."" To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule and modify it. The ""rule `wall`"" is at (-3,5) (since it's 3 steps left and 5 steps up from the starting point?), wait no—wait the positions are relative. The ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 3 step up"" from the starting point (where Baba's rule is) would be at (-3, 3). Similarly, other rules are positioned relative to the starting point.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the player's position is at the ""rule `baba`"" block, which is at 3 steps left. To move, I can go in any direction, but need to avoid walls. Let's try to outline possible moves.

From the starting position (-3,0):

- Moving right: (-2,0), (-1,0), (0,0), etc., but there's a wall at (2,0) and beyond.
- Moving up: (-3,1), (-3,2), up to (-3,5) where the ""rule `wall`"" is.
- Moving left: further left, but not sure if there's anything there.
- Moving down: (-3,-1), etc., but there's a wall at (-3,-2 steps down?), not sure.

If I go up to (-3,1), is there a clear path? At (-3,1), are there any objects? Looking at the objects list, there's a ""wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up"" which would be at (2,2). So from (-3,1), moving right towards (2,2) is blocked. Maybe go up more.

At (-3,5), there's the ""rule `wall`"" block. If I can move that, perhaps change the ""wall is stop"" rule. But to move it, I need to be adjacent to it. From (-3,0) to (-3,5) requires moving up 5 steps, but are there walls in between? The ""wall 2 steps to the right and 5 step up"" is at (2,5), which is separate. So moving up from (-3,0) to (-3,5) is possible if the path is clear. But looking at the objects, there's a ""wall 2 steps to the right and 5 step up"" at (2,5), which is not on the same vertical line. So maybe the path up from (-3,0) to (-3,5) is open except for the walls at (2,5) and others, but those are to the right.

If I can reach (-3,5) where the ""rule `wall`"" is, then I can move that text block to change the rule. For example, moving it to say ""wall is push"" or something. But how to recombine the text blocks. The rules are formed by ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push,"" I need to move the ""wall"" text block and the ""stop"" text block apart and create a new combination.

Alternatively, take the ""wall"" rule and combine it with a different property. For instance, move the ""wall"" rule to be next to the ""you"" rule, creating ""wall is you."" That would make walls act like you, meaning I can walk through them. But is that possible?

Let me try to simulate this. The ""rule `wall`"" is at (-3,5), ""rule `is`"" is at (-2,5), and ""rule `stop`"" is at (-1,5). So if I move the ""rule `wall`"" from (-3,5) to, say, (-3,4), then place it next to the ""rule `stop`"" at (-1,5), maybe I can form a new rule. Wait, but the ""is"" rule is in between. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, focus on the ""rule `ball`"" at (1,2). If I can move that to create a new rule. For example, moving it to say ""ball is win,"" then touching the ball would make it win. The ball is at (4,4), but there's a wall at (2,4). So I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" text block to a position where it can form a new rule adjacent to a ""is"" text block.

The ""rule `ball`"" is at (1,2). There's a ""rule `is`"" at (6,5) and others. If I can move the ""rule `ball`"" to be next to an ""is"" rule, then combine it with a property. For example, move the ""rule `ball`"" to (2,2), which is a wall, but can I move through walls? No, because ""wall is stop."" So that's blocked.

Alternatively, move the ""rule `ball`"" down to (1,1), which is a free space. Then, if I can place it next to an ""is"" rule to form ""ball is [property]"". The nearest ""is"" rule is at (6,5) which is far away. Not helpful.

This is tricky. Maybe another approach: since ""baba is you,"" maybe I can move the ""rule `baba`"" to create a new rule that makes me win. For example, moving it to say ""baba is win,"" then touching myself would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""rule `baba`"" text block to a position where it can be combined with an ""is"" and ""win"" or something.

The ""rule `baba`"" is at (-3,0). If I move it to (-3,1), then next to it there's no ""is"" rule. The nearest ""is"" rule is at (-2,0) and (-2,5). Moving the ""baba"" rule up to (-3,5) where the ""is"" rules are, but that's a long way.

Alternatively, find a path to the key by moving around using other rules. For example, if I can make the ball a you, then I could move through it. But ""ball is you"" would mean I can push or move through the ball. But how to create that rule.

The ""rule `ball`"" is at (1,2). If I can move it next to an ""is"" rule and a ""you"" rule. For instance, move the ""rule `ball`"" to (2,2), but there's a wall there. Not possible. Or to (1,3), but not sure.

Wait, the ""key is win"" rule is at (5,5). If I can move that rule down to where the key is, so that the key is at (4,1) and the ""key is win"" is there, then maybe I can reach the key. But moving the ""rule `key`"" from (5,5) to (4,1) requires passing through walls. It's a long way down and left, blocked by walls at (2,5), (2,4), etc.

This seems really challenging. Maybe I need to think outside the box. What if I use the fact that ""baba is you"" to push objects? For example, if I can push the key past the wall. The key is at (4,1), and there's a wall at (2,1). To push the key right, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to where I'm pushing. But since the wall is at (2,1), pushing the key right from (4,1) would require the key to go through the wall, which is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the wall rules. If I can make the wall a pushable object, then I could move it out of the way. But to do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is push."" To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" and ""stop"" text blocks apart and create a new rule.

The ""rule `wall`"" is at (-3,5), ""rule `is`"" at (-2,5), ""rule `stop`"" at (-1,5). If I move the ""rule `wall`"" to (-3,4), then next to it there's no ""is","

Let's see what's going on in this Baba Is You level. First, I need to understand the current rules and the positions of the objects. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. That means whatever is a wall can't be moved through, the key is the object we need to reach to win, and Baba is the controllable character since ""baba is you"".

Looking at the objects on the map, the Baba rule is 3 steps to the left. So I need to move Baba to that position first so that the ""baba is you"" rule applies to me. Wait, no—if the ""baba is you"" rule is already active, then I must be the Baba tile. So maybe I'm already controlled by Baba. But where is Baba located? The objects list doesn't explicitly mention Baba's position. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left"" is part of the rules, so the actual Baba tile is elsewhere. Wait, in Baba Is You, the character you control is determined by the ""you"" rule. Since ""baba is you"" is active, the Baba tile is the one you control. So I need to find where the Baba tile is on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a bunch of walls, a key, and a ball. The rules are spread out. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 5 steps up, and it's defined as ""key is win"", so reaching the key would make it the win condition. But the key is behind walls, I think. Let me parse the positions again.

The rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left. The rule `is` is 2 steps to the left, and `you` is 1 step to the left. So these three text blocks form ""BABA IS YOU"" somewhere on the map. The actual Baba tile must be adjacent to these rules. If I can reach that area, maybe I can manipulate the rules. But first, I need to move to where Baba is.

Alternatively, maybe the ""baba is you"" rule is already applied, so I'm the Baba tile. If that's the case, I need to move towards the key. But the path is blocked by walls. The walls are all labeled as stop, so I can't move through them. But perhaps I can move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to make something else the win condition, like ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba would win the level.

Let me think. The key is at 5 steps right and 5 steps up, but there's a wall 2 steps right and 5 steps up. So maybe the key is behind that wall. To get to the key, I need to move the wall or change the rule. But walls are stop, so I can't push them unless they don't have the stop property. Wait, the rule says ""wall is stop"", so any object that is a wall is stop. But maybe if I change the rule to ""stop is wall"", then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how?

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that overrides the existing ones. For example, if I can make ""you"" apply to the key, then moving the key would make me win. Or make ""win"" apply to Baba, so touching Baba would win. 

Looking at the current rules: wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The objects include a ball with a rule ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". Maybe I can use the ball to rewrite rules. Since the ball isn't stop (unless there's a rule saying it's stop), I can move it. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule to say ""baba is win"", then touching Baba (which I am) would make me win. 

But how to do that? The key is at 5 steps right and 5 steps up, with the ""key is win"" rule next to it. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, but since I'm Baba (you), and the key is win, maybe I can move towards it. However, the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up is a stop, so I can't go through it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the wall. If the wall isn't stop, but according to the rule ""wall is stop"", it is. So unless I change that rule, I can't move through or push the wall. So perhaps I need to move the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else. For example, if I can move the ""is"" next to ""wall"" to make it ""stop is wall"", then walls would no longer be stop. But how to do that?

To move a text block, you have to be adjacent to both the text block and the object it's sitting on. So for example, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". They are placed 3, 2, 1 steps to the left respectively, all at 5 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" block, then the rule would change. But to move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it. 

Assuming I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule (3 steps left), I need to move towards the ""is"" block at 2 steps left. If I move right once, I can get to the ""is"" block. But wait, where am I exactly? The problem is that the exact positions of the Baba tile aren't listed in the objects, only the rules. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the Baba tile is adjacent to the ""baba is you"" rule. So if the rule ""baba"" is 3 steps left, then the actual Baba tile is at 3 steps left, and I need to move towards the right to reach the ""is"" block at 2 steps left.

So, if I'm at 3 steps left, moving right once would take me to the ""is"" block's position (2 steps left). Then, I can move the ""is"" block. But to move a text block, you have to push it onto an empty space or another object that isn't stop. The space to the right of the ""is"" block (1 step left) is occupied by the ""stop"" rule. So if I move the ""is"" block to the right, it would replace the ""stop"" rule's position. But can I do that?

Wait, the ""is"" block is 2 steps left and 5 steps up. The ""stop"" block is 1 step left and 5 steps up. So they are adjacent horizontally. If I move the ""is"" block to the right (towards the ""stop"" block), I can swap their positions. But since the ""stop"" block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, moving it might break the rule. But if I can move the ""is"" block over the ""stop"" block, then the rule becomes ""wall stop is"", which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" block to a different spot.

Alternatively, maybe the goal is to create a new rule that makes Baba the win condition. For example, moving the ""win"" rule from the key to Baba. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. To move that, I need to go there, but again, blocked by walls. 

Another idea: the ball is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up, with a rule ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". The ball isn't stop, so I can move it. If I can use the ball to rewrite rules, perhaps by placing it next to a text block to form a new rule. For example, moving the ""ball"" rule next to the ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win"". Then, touching the ball would make me win. But how to get the ball to that position?

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to reach it. But the path is blocked. Let's see the layout:

Looking at the vertical positions:

At 5 steps up: wall, key, is, win (all to the right).

At 4 steps up: wall, ball.

At 3 steps up: wall.

At 2 steps up: rule ball.

At 1 step up: key.

At ground level (0 step up): wall, wall, wall, ..., key at 4 steps right.

So the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. To get there, I need to go down from higher up, but there are walls blocking the path. The only way might be to remove the wall rules.

Alternatively, if I can push the wall that's in the way. The wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that wall, but it's stop, so I can't. Unless I change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So, the plan might be:

1. Move to the area of the ""baba is you"" rule (3 steps left).
2. Move right to interact with the ""is"" block (2 steps left) and reposition the rules to change ""wall is stop"" to ""stop is wall"", making walls movable.
3. Once walls are not stop, push them out of the way to reach the key.

But how to move the ""is"" block? Let's think. If I am at the ""baba"" rule's position (3 steps left), moving right once gets me to the ""is"" block's position (2 steps left). Then, I can move the ""is"" block to the right by one step, but that spot is occupied by the ""stop"" block. So perhaps I need to move the ""stop"" block first. But ""stop"" is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I move the ""is"" block over the ""stop"" block, the rule becomes ""wall stop is"", which is invalid. Then, maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, and walls are no longer stop.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" block to a different position and combine it with other text blocks. 

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the steps:

- Locate Baba's position. Since ""baba is you"" is active, Baba is the tile we control. The ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left"" must be part of the ""baba is you"" rule. So the actual Baba tile is likely adjacent to that rule. Assuming the Baba tile is at 3 steps left (same position as the ""baba"" rule), then I need to move right towards the key.

But moving right from 3 steps left would take me towards the key's location. However, the path is blocked by walls. The wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up is stop, so I can't pass through. 

Alternative approach: Use the ball to rewrite rules. The ball is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up with a rule attached. If I can move the ball's rule to modify another rule. For example, moving the ""rule `ball`"" to be next to the ""win"" rule to make ""ball is win"". Then, touching the ball would make me win. But how to get the ball there?

The ball is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. So I need to move the ball right and up. But to move the ball, I have to be adjacent to it. If I can get to the ball's position, then move it towards the ""win"" rule. 

Assuming I'm at the Baba's position (3 steps left), I need to move all the way to the ball's location. That's a long journey through blocked paths. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. If I can make the key not be stop, then perhaps I can move it. But the key is defined as win, not stop. So if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position, maybe I can interact with the key directly. 

Alternatively, if I can make Baba a pusher. There's a rule ""push is you"" or something, but that's not present here. The current rules don't include pushing, so maybe I can't push objects unless they are not stop. 

Another thought: The ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" is a separate rule. If I can move this rule to adjacent objects, I could create new rules. For example, placing ""ball is win"" next to the key. 

To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is 1 step to the right and 1 step up from the main ball object. So the ball is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up, and the rule is at 5 steps right and 5 steps up? Wait, no. The rule `ball` is 1 step to the right and 1 step up from where? The description says ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". But relative to what? Probably relative to the ball object. So if the ball is at (x, y), the rule is at (x+1, y+1). 

If I can move that rule, say, to be next to the key, then I can make ""ball is win"" and ""key is ball"", but that might not help. Alternatively, moving the ""win"" rule to be next to Baba, making ""baba is win"".

But this requires navigating to those areas, which is blocked by walls. 

Perhaps the key is to realize that the current rules can be rewritten by moving text blocks. For example, if I can take the ""is"" from ""wall is stop"" and create a new rule like ""you is push"" or something. 

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", maybe I can move the ""baba"" text block to be next to another property. For example, moving ""baba"" next to ""win"" to make ""baba is win"". 

But the ""baba"" rule is at 3 steps left. To move it to near the ""win"" rule at 7 steps right and 5 steps up, that's a long distance. There are walls in between. 

This seems really complicated. Maybe I need to focus on the immediate goal. The key is win, so I need to reach it. But how? 

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The path from there to higher up has walls. Maybe if I can remove the walls by changing their rules. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""stop is wall"", so walls are no longer stop. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" in ""wall is stop"". The ""wall"" rule is at 3 steps left, ""is"" at 2 steps left, ""stop"" at 1 step left, all at 5 steps up. If I can move the ""is"" block to the right, swapping places with the ""stop"" block, then the rule becomes ""wall stop is"", which is invalid. Then, the original ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, and walls might no longer be stop. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (3 steps left) to the ""is"" block at 2 steps left (move right once).
2. Push the ""is"" block to the right (1 step left), into the position of the ""stop"" block.
3. Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is effectively ""wall stop is"", which is not a valid rule, so walls are no longer stop.
4. Now, walls can be moved if they don't have the stop property. So I can push the walls out of the way.

Once walls are no longer stop, I can move through them or push them. For example, the wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up can be pushed down or sideways. 

After removing the stop property from walls, I can navigate to the key. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. The path down from higher levels is now possible because walls aren't stop. So move down from 5 steps up to 1 step up, avoiding the walls. 

But how to get to the higher levels in the first place? The initial position of Baba is at 3 steps left. To reach 5 steps up, I need to move up, but there are walls. Wait, after removing the stop property, maybe walls can be climbed over? No, in Baba Is You, only objects that are not stop can be moved through. If walls are no longer stop, you can walk through them. 

So the plan is:

- Remove the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""is"" block.
- Then, move freely through walls to reach the key.

But how to execute this? Let's break it down step by step.

Current position: Assuming Baba is at the ""baba"" rule's position, which is 3 steps left. Need to move right to the ""is"" block at 2 steps left.

Action: right

Now at 2 steps left, next to the ""is"" block and the ""stop"" block.

Action: right (to push the ""is"" block to the right, into the ""stop"" block's position)

Now the rule becomes ""wall stop is"", which is invalid, so ""wall is stop"" is no longer a rule. Walls are no longer stop.

Now, I can move through walls. Need to navigate to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step up.

From current position (2 steps left, 5 steps up), need to move right and down.

Move right: to 3 steps left, 5 steps up.

But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 steps up. Since walls are no longer stop, I can move through them. Wait, no—if the wall's rule is removed, then it's just a wall object without the stop property. So I can move over it or around it.

So from 2 steps left, 5 steps up, move right to 3 steps left, 5 steps up (pass through the wall? Or is the wall now just an object that can be moved?).

Actually, in Baba Is You, if an object doesn't have the stop property, you can walk over it. So moving right from 2 steps left, 5 steps up to 3 steps left, 5 steps up (which is a wall) is possible because walls are no longer stop.

Continue moving right: 4 steps left, 5 steps up. Then down to 4 steps left, 4 steps up. The ball is there.","

Let's see where I am in this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is currently the key. But the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So I can move because I'm Baba and 'baba is you' means I can move around. The walls are stops, so I have to avoid them.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's a wall directly to the right of me (assuming I'm at the position where the 'rule baba' is located, which is 3 steps left and maybe some down). Wait, the rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down from where? Let me parse the positions.

The objects are listed with their positions relative to the player, I think. The rule `baba` is 3 steps to the left. Then there's rule `is` and `you` one step left each. So maybe the player is positioned such that moving left three steps lands at the `baba` rule. So the player is likely at a position where moving right would lead towards the key.

But there are walls blocking the path. Let's map this out mentally. To get to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step up, I need to navigate through the walls. The walls are at various positions: up 5 steps, 4, 3, etc. The key is down one step from the wall at 2 steps up. So maybe there's a path downwards.

Wait, looking at the objects: there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, then key at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So between the player and the key, there's a wall at 2 steps right, 1 up, and then the key is further right. So to get to the key, I need to move right past the wall. But how?

But the active rule is 'wall is stop', meaning I can't move into walls. So I need to find a way to either move the wall rule or create a new rule that allows me to pass. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball rule. There's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I can change that, maybe I can manipulate the ball's properties.

Wait, the ball is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up. The rule for ball is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. So if I move the 'ball is ...' rule, perhaps I can make ball not a stop. For example, if I make 'ball is you', then maybe I can push it or use it to block walls. But I need to move the text blocks.

But the text blocks that define rules are either stationary or can be moved if they aren't stopped. Since the current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you, none of the text blocks themselves are stopped except maybe if there's a 'stop' rule applied to them. Let me check.

The rule `stop` is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So maybe other text blocks aren't stopped. So I can try to move the 'ball is' rule. If I can move that to say 'ball is you', then maybe I can use the ball to reach the key. Or maybe change 'key is win' to something else, but the key is the win object.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, maybe I can push objects if they are not stopped. But the walls are stop, so I can't push them. But the ball might be movable if its rule is changed.

Wait, the current rules are:

- wall is stop
- key is win
- baba is you

So walls are stops, key is the win condition, and I'm Baba (you). So to get to the key, which is win, I need to reach it without hitting a wall. The path to the key (4 right, 1 up) is blocked by a wall at 2 right, 1 up. So how to get around that?

Maybe if I can make the wall not a stop. For that, I need to change the 'wall is stop' rule. To do that, I have to move the 'wall' rule, the 'is' rule, and the 'stop' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 3 left, 3 up. The 'is' is at 2 left, 3 up. The 'stop' is at 1 left, 3 up. So these three blocks form the 'wall is stop' rule.

If I can move these blocks, I can change the rule. For example, moving 'stop' to 'win' so that 'wall is win' instead of 'stop'. But to move them, I need to be adjacent to the text blocks and they shouldn't be stopped. Since the text blocks themselves aren't stopped (unless there's a rule saying they are), I can probably move them.

So the plan could be: move the 'stop' rule to a new position, altering the 'wall is stop' into something else, like 'wall is you' or 'stop is win'. But how?

Alternatively, use the ball to break through. If I can make the ball a pusher or a mover. But for that, I need to modify the ball's rule.

Looking at the ball's rule: 'rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up'. So the ball's rule is at 1 right, 2 up. The actual ball is at 4 right, 2 up. So if I can move the 'ball is ...' rule, perhaps to 'ball is push' or 'ball is you', then the ball could be used to move obstacles.

But moving that rule requires getting to its position. The rule is at 1 right, 2 up. From where am I positioned? The 'rule `baba`' is at 3 left, so if I'm at that position, moving right three steps gets me to the 'baba' rule. Then moving up would reach the 'wall' rules. But there are walls up there at 5 step up, so maybe I need to find a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'is' rule. For example, in the 'wall is stop' rule, if I can change the 'stop' to 'win', then walls wouldn't be stops. But to do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. So from the player's position (assuming they are at the 'baba' rule's location, 3 left, ...), moving left three steps gets to the 'baba' rule, then up three steps to reach the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' rules. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up, which might block the path.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: since the key is a win, and it's at 4 right, 1 up, perhaps I can make the key not a win anymore and make Baba a win. For example, change 'key is win' to 'baba is win'. To do that, I need to move the 'key', 'is', and 'win' rules.

The 'key' rule is at 5 right, 5 up. The 'is' is at 6 right, 5 up. The 'win' is at 7 right, 5 up. So those three form the 'key is win' rule. If I can move them, say, to 'baba is win', then I could reach the key without it being the win, and instead Baba would be win wherever he is.

But moving those blocks would require navigating to their positions, which might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, use the ball to move them, but the ball's rule is still 'ball is ...' which might not allow it to push other blocks.

Alternatively, use the fact that I'm Baba (you) to move the text blocks if they aren't stopped. Since the current rules are wall is stop, but the text blocks themselves aren't stopped (unless there's a rule applying stop to them), I can move them.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the 'key is win' rule to 'baba is win'. This would make reaching Baba (me) a win, so I don't need to go to the key.

To do this, I need to move the 'key' block, 'is' block, and 'win' block. The 'key' is at 5 right, 5 up. The 'is' at 6 right, 5 up. The 'win' at 7 right, 5 up. So if I can move these three to form 'baba is win', I need to position them accordingly.

But how to reach those positions? The player is at 3 left (rule `baba`), so moving right would get towards the key area, but there are walls. Let's see:

From the player's position (assuming at 3 left), moving right 1 step lands at rule `is` (2 left), then right again to rule `you` (1 left), then right to the wall at 2 steps right. So maybe the player is at 3 left, 0 down? Not sure about the exact coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 steps left and 2 steps down. So moving right would take them towards the center.

This is tricky without knowing the exact grid layout. But given the observations, the key is at 4 right, 1 up. The walls are blocking the direct path. So maybe the solution is to change the 'wall is stop' rule to 'wall is', effectively removing the stop property from walls.

To do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left, 3 up. If I can move that block to another part of the grid, then the 'wall is stop' rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be stops. Then I could walk through walls.

But how to move the 'stop' block? The player is at 3 left, so moving left three steps reaches the 'baba' rule. Then moving up three steps reaches the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' rules. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up, which is in the way. So maybe I need to find a different path.

Alternatively, use the ball to push the 'stop' block. If the ball's rule is changed to allow pushing, but that requires modifying the ball's rule first.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the player able to move through walls. For example, 'baba is not stop'. But to create that, I need to have the text blocks 'baba', 'is', 'not', 'stop' in the correct positions.

But the available text blocks are limited to those on the map. The current rules are wall, is, stop, key, is, win, ball, is, you. So maybe there's a 'not' block somewhere? No, the observations don't mention a 'not' rule. So I can't create 'not' from scratch.

Hmm. This is challenging. Let's think differently. Maybe the key isn't the actual win. Since the active rule is 'key is win', but maybe I can change that. If I can move the 'key', 'is', 'win' blocks to form 'baba is win', then I just need to reach Baba (myself), which is possible.

To do that, I need to move those three blocks. The 'key' is at 5 right,5 up; 'is' at 6 right,5 up; 'win' at7 right,5 up. To form 'baba is win', I need to place 'baba', 'is', 'win' in a row. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left. So I need to move the 'key', 'is', 'win' blocks to the left to align with 'baba'.

But moving those blocks would require navigating past walls. The path from the key area (5 right,5 up) to the baba area (3 left) is blocked by walls. For example, there's a wall at 2 right,3 up, which is between the key area and the baba area.

Alternatively, use the ball to push the blocks. If the ball can be made into a pusher, but that requires changing its rule.

Another idea: since the ball is at 4 right,2 up, and there's a rule for ball at1 right,2 up. If I can change the ball's rule to 'ball is push', then maybe I can use the ball to move other blocks. But first, I need to move the ball's rule.

The ball's rule is at1 right,2 up. To get there, from the player's position (assuming at3 left), I need to move right to 1 left (which is 2 steps right), then up to 2 up. But is there a path? There's a wall at2 right,3 up, but maybe moving down first.

Alternatively, move right to the 'you' rule (2 left), then right to 'baba' (3 left), then maybe up. This is getting too vague without the exact grid.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is at1 left,3 up. If I can move that to another position, say, next to 'wall' so that 'wall is' instead of 'stop', then walls wouldn't be stops. To move the 'stop' block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction.

Assuming the player is at the 'baba' rule's position (3 left), moving left three steps gets to 'baba', then left again to 'is' (2 left), then left to 'you' (1 left). From there, moving up three steps would reach the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' rules at3 up. But there's a wall at2 right,3 up, which is in the way. So maybe the player can't get past that wall to reach the 'stop' rule.

This suggests that the direct path to modify the rules is blocked. So maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, there's a rule `ball` at1 step right and1 step up. The actual ball is at4 right,2 up. If I can move the 'ball' rule to make it 'ball is you', then the ball would become controllable. Once I control the ball, I could use it to interact with other objects.

To move the 'ball' rule, I need to go to its position (1 right,1 up). From the player's position (3 left), moving right four steps would get to 1 left (since 3 left to 0 is right three steps, then one more to 1 left?), then up one step. But there's a wall at2 right,1 up, which blocks the path. So moving right past the wall is not possible because walls are stops.

This is a problem. The player can't move through walls, so the path to the 'ball' rule is blocked. Hence, can't change the ball's rule directly.

Alternative idea: Maybe the key is at4 right,1 up, and there's a way around the wall at2 right,1 up. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can walk through it. To do that, change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is', which requires moving the 'stop' rule.

But again, accessing the 'stop' rule is blocked by walls.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to use the fact that 'baba is you' to move the text blocks if they are not stopped. Since the text blocks themselves aren't stopped (unless by another rule), maybe I can move them even if there are walls nearby, as long as I'm not moving into a wall.

For example, the 'stop' rule is at1 left,3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. From the player's position (3 left), moving left three steps gets to 'baba', then left to 'is' (2 left), then left to 'you' (1 left). Now at1 left, the player can look up to find the 'stop' rule at3 up. So moving up from1 left would reach the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' rules. But there's a wall at2 right,3 up, which is two steps to the right from the player's current position (1 left,3 up). So the player is at1 left,3 up, and the 'stop' rule is at1 left,3 up (same position?). Wait, no. The 'stop' rule is listed as 1 step to the left and3 step up from the player's initial position?

This is getting too confusing without seeing the actual grid. Maybe I need to focus on possible actions based on the available moves.

The valid actions are idle, up, right, down, left. Given the previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action is to move left towards the 'you' rule, then adjust position to access the 'stop' rule.

But according to the latest observation, after moving down, the player's position might have changed. The last action was 'down', leading to the current observation where the 'wall' rule is now at3 step to the left and5 step up, which might mean the player moved down.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to move left to reach the 'you' rule, then move up to get to the 'stop' rule.

But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say. Given the previous failures, maybe the intended action is to move left towards the 'you' rule to rearrange the rules.

The current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move unless there's a wall blocking the way. The goal is usually to reach the key, which is set as win, but I need to confirm if that's still the case.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there's also a rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 5 step up. Wait, that might be a text block that defines the key's property. Since the active rule is ""key is win"", the key's position might be where the object is placed. The key object is at 4 right, 1 up, so I need to get there.

But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Also, the path might be blocked by other walls. Let me check the positions again. My current position isn't specified, but the rules and objects are laid out. The rule `baba` is at 3 steps left. So maybe I'm at that position. If I move left, I hit the rule `baba`, but since I'm Baba, maybe I can move? Wait, no, the rules are separate. The `baba` rule is a text block that says ""baba is you"", so I can move unless blocked by a stop (wall).

So, from my position at 3 left, to get to the key at 4 right, 1 up, I need to move right. But there's a wall at 2 steps right. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me map this out.

The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up is a physical wall that stops movement. The key is at 4 right, 1 up. So to get there, I need to go around the walls. Let's see the path:

From baba's position (3 left), moving right would take me towards the walls. There's a wall at 2 right, 1 up. So if I go right twice, I hit that wall. But maybe there's a way around. Let's check other directions.

Looking at the rule `ball` at 1 step right and 2 step up. Maybe I can move up first. If I go up from my position (3 left), there's a rule `stop` at 1 step left and 4 step up. Not sure if that affects movement. Alternatively, moving down might lead to the key at 4 right, 1 up.

Wait, the key is at 4 right, 1 up. From my current position (3 left), moving right once gets me to 2 right, but there's a wall there at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to go up first. If I move up from 3 left, then maybe there's a path.

Looking at the wall at 2 steps right and 5 step up. That's higher up. The rule `key` is at 5 steps right and 5 step up. So perhaps moving up five steps would reach the key's text block, but the actual key object is at 4 right, 1 up. Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can create a new rule that changes what is win. The current active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key would win. But if I can make ""baba is win"", then just standing on Baba would be the solution. But how?

To change the rules, I need to move the text blocks. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 5 step up. If I can move that text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"", then create ""baba is win"". But I have to move the objects without stepping on stop (wall) or moving blocked objects.

Looking at the available text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", ""key"", ""win"", and ""baba"". The ""you"" rule is also there. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move unless stopped.

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction, but the destination must not be a stop. For example, the ""ball"" rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up. If I move right from there, maybe I can place it elsewhere.

But the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe the solution is to grab the key and move it, but the key's rule is already ""key is win"". Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""you"", maybe I can push objects if they're not stop. Wait, the rules don't mention push, but in Baba Is You, sometimes you can push objects if they're not STOP. But here, the walls are STOP, so other objects might be moveable.

Wait, the ball has a rule ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". So the ball is defined as a ball, and there's a text block saying ""ball is..."". But the current active rule is wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So ball's property isn't defined here, so it's movable unless blocked by STOP.

So maybe I can move the ball out of the way. But how does that help?

Alternatively, focus on the key. The key is at 4 right, 1 up. To reach it, I need to navigate around the walls. From my position at 3 left, moving right towards the key is blocked by a wall at 2 right, 1 up. So maybe move up first. If I go up from 3 left, then up again, perhaps I can get to a position where I can go around the wall.

Looking at the map, moving up from 3 left:

- Step up: 2 left, 4 up. There's a rule `stop` at 1 step left and 4 up. Not sure if that affects movement. Maybe moving up to 2 left, 4 up is possible if there's no wall.

But the wall at 2 steps right and 5 step up is higher up. Not sure.

Alternatively, move left from 3 left to 2 left, then see if I can find a path. But the goal is to get to the key at 4 right, 1 up, so moving left might not help.

Wait, maybe the key is at 4 right, 1 up, which is south-east of my current position. So I need to move right and down. But the wall at 2 right, 1 up is blocking the direct path.

So possible paths:

1. Move up, around the walls, then right and down.
2. Move right past the wall by finding a detour.
3. Manipulate rules to remove the wall's stop property.

For option 3, if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block or change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 3 left, 5 up; ""is"" at 2 left, 5 up; ""stop"" at 1 left, 5 up. So to change this rule, I need to rearrange these text blocks.

If I can move the ""stop"" text block away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. For example, move the ""stop"" block to another position. But moving it requires that the destination is not a stop.

The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 5 up. If I move it down, say to 1 left, 4 up, which is a free space (no wall mentioned there), then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be incomplete, possibly removing the stop property from walls.

But I need to check if that's allowed. In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks adjacent to them if the path is clear. So from ""stop"" at 1 left, 5 up, can I move it down (to 1 left, 4 up)? That space is not occupied by a wall, so yes. Then the rule would become ""wall is [nothing]"", effectively removing the stop property. Then walls wouldn't block movement, allowing me to go around them.

That seems like a viable strategy. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 5 up.
2. Move it down to 1 left, 4 up, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Then move freely around the walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that makes ""baba"" win. For example, move ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together to create ""baba is win"". Then touching Baba would win the level.

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, current position. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left, same level. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 5 up. So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move these three text blocks adjacent to each other.

But that might be more complex. Let's first consider removing the wall's stop property.

To move the ""stop"" block:

- Current position is 3 left (assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's position).
- Need to move right towards the ""stop"" block. From 3 left, move right once to 2 left, same level. Check if there's a wall there. The wall at 2 steps right and 5 step up is higher up, so at 2 left, current level (5 up), there's a rule `is` at 2 left, 5 up. So can I move right from 3 left to 2 left? Yes, because there's a rule `is` there, but can I pass through? Or do I need to be adjacent?

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move into adjacent objects unless they are STOP. Since the ""is"" block is not a STOP, I can move past it. So from 3 left, moving right to 2 left (adjacent to the ""is"" block), then right again to 1 left, which is the ""stop"" block.

So path: 3 left → 2 left (pass through ""is"") → 1 left (stop block).

Once at 1 left, 5 up (stop block), I can move it down to 1 left, 4 up. Then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken.

After that, walls are no longer STOP, so I can walk through them. Then I can go around to the key.

Alternatively, if I make myself win, that would be faster. To do that, need to create ""baba is win"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left. The ""is"" rule is at 2 left. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 5 up.

So I need to move these three together. Let's see:

From my current position at 3 left, move left to 2 left (adjacent to ""is""), then left to 3 left? Wait, no. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, ""is"" at 2 left, ""win"" at 7 right. So perhaps move the ""win"" block leftwards.

But the ""win"" block is at 7 right, 5 up. To move it left, I need to be adjacent to it. From where? The only way to reach it is by moving through the map, but there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, after removing the wall's stop property, I can move freely and reach the ""win"" block.

So steps:

1. Remove ""wall is stop"" by moving ""stop"" down.
2. Move to the ""win"" block at 7 right, 5 up.
3. Combine ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".

Once that's done, just standing on Baba would make me win.

But this requires several steps. Let's prioritize.

First, let's try removing the stop property from walls.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Here's the plan:

- From current position (assuming at 3 left, same level as the ""baba"" rule), move right to 2 left (adjacent to ""is"").
- Then move right again to 1 left, which is the ""stop"" block.
- Move the ""stop"" block down to 1 left, 4 up. This breaks the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer STOP, so I can walk through them.

Then, navigate to the key at 4 right, 1 up. Since walls are passable, I can go around them.

Alternatively, after removing the stop property, I can move the ""key"" block to be under Baba, but the key is already a win object. So touching it would win.

But maybe the key is blocked by walls even if they're not STOP. Wait, no, if walls are no longer STOP, I can push past them.

So after removing the stop property:

- Path from 3 left to 4 right, 1 up: go right past the wall at 2 right, 1 up (since it's no longer STOP), then continue right to the key.

But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 step up, but that's higher up. The key is at 4 right, 1 up, which is south of the walls.

So moving right from 3 left to 4 left (past the stop block now), then right to 4 right (key's position).

But need to check if the movement is allowed.

Alternatively, since the key is a win object, even if I can't reach it by moving, maybe I can push it? But I'm not sure if keys can be pushed.

Another approach: Create ""baba is win"" rule.

To do that, need to have ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" adjacent.

Current positions:

- ""baba"" rule: 3 left
- ""is"" rule: 2 left
- ""win"" rule: 7 right, 5 up

So need to move the ""win"" rule to the left.

But the path from 7 right, 5 up to 3 left is blocked by walls. Unless we remove the stop property first.

So first remove stop property, then move the ""win"" block left.

So steps:

1. Remove ""wall is stop"" by moving ""stop"" down.
2. Move ""win"" block from 7 right, 5 up to 3 left area.
3. Assemble ""baba is win"".

This would make touching Baba (me) be the win condition.

But moving the ""win"" block requires navigating around the now-passable walls.

From 7 right, 5 up (win block), move left towards the center.

But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 step up. Since walls are no longer STOP, can I move through them?

Yes, but I have to move around them. The path from 7 right, 5 up to 3 left would require moving left past the wall at 2 right, 5 up. Since it's not a STOP, I can move around it.

So move left from 7 right, 5 up to 6 right, 5 up, then 5 right, etc., down to 3 left.

Once the ""win"" block is at 3 left, adjacent to ""baba"" and ""is"", create the new rule.

This would make ""baba is win"", so touching Baba wins.

Alternatively, after moving the ""win"" block, combine it with ""baba"" and ""is"".

But this is quite involved. Given the time steps, perhaps the quickest solution is to remove the stop property and grab the key.

But how to execute this in the given actions.

The current action choices are the movement directions: up, down, left, right, idle.

So the immediate action would be to move towards the ""stop"" block to disable the wall rule.

From the observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the left and 5 step up.

Assuming my current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 step to the left. So to reach the ""stop"" block:

- Move left once to 2 step left.
- Then left again to 1 step left.

But between me (3 left) and the ""stop"" block (1 left, 5 up), there's the ""is"" block at 2 left, 5 up.

So moving left from 3 left to 2 left (adjacent to ""is""), then left to 1 left (stop block).

Once at 1 left, 5 up, I can move the ""stop"" block down to 1 left, 4 up.

The action to do that would be to move down from the ""stop"" block's current position.

But the problem is that each action is a single step, not multiple. So I need to execute each move step by step.

But the user is asking for a single action based on the current observation.

In the latest observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the left and 5 step up. My position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 step to the left. So to get to the ""stop"" block, I need to move left twice.

But each action is one step. So the first action would be to move left once to 2 step left.

But the current observation's active rules and objects don't specify my exact position, which is inferred from the ""baba"" rule's position. Assuming I'm at the same location as the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 step to the left.

Therefore, the immediate action should be to move left to reach the ""is"" block, then left again to the ""stop"" block.

But since each action is a single step, the first valid action is to move left.

Alternatively, if I can move down from the ""stop"" block's position, but I'm not there yet.

Given the current observation, the best action is to move left towards the ""is"" block, then left again to the ""stop"" block. But since we can only choose one action, the first step is to move left.

So the chosen action is left.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The player is Baba, and the goal is usually to reach the key which is set as win, but maybe that can change.

First, looking at the active rules: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So I'm Baba, and I can move unless there's a wall. The key is the win object, so I need to reach that. Looking at the objects on the map.

The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step up from my current position. Wait, where exactly am I? The rules for baba are at 3 steps to the left. So if rule baba is 3 steps left, then my position is 3 steps right from there? Let me visualize.

The rule 'baba' is at 3 steps left, and then there's 'is' and 'you' next to it. So I'm probably at that position. The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 up. But there are walls blocking the path. Let's check the path.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall 2 steps to the right at various positions. From the baba's position, moving right directly would hit a wall at 2 steps right. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to rearrange the rules.

The 'rule ball' is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. Maybe I can move that to create a new rule. For example, if I make 'baba is win' or something. But first, I need to reach the 'ball' rule to move it.

To get to the ball rule, I might need to move around the walls. Let's see. If I move down from my current position (since the key is up but blocked), maybe there's a path. The wall to the right and 1 step down is there, but maybe moving down first.

Alternatively, can I push a rule? The rules are text blocks, so if they're not stopped, I can move them. The 'stop' property is on walls, so other text blocks like 'ball is' can be moved.

So the plan could be: move to the 'ball' rule, then rearrange it to make Baba the win. But how to get there. Let's map the path.

Current position: rule baba at 3 left. If I move right, I hit a wall at 2 steps right. So need to go around. Maybe move down first. Looking at the walls below: there's a wall 2 steps right and 1 step down. So moving down from my position (3 left) would take me somewhere. Wait, directions are a bit confusing here. Let me try to sketch it mentally.

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 steps to the left. So if I move right, I approach that rule's position. Then to the right again, there's a wall at 2 steps right. So perhaps moving down from my current spot.

If I move down once, where would that place me? The map shows walls at various positions, but maybe there's a path. Alternatively, maybe move left, but the 'baba' rule is already at the leftmost part. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is 4 steps right and 1 up, but the path is blocked by walls. So to reach the key, I might need to change the 'key is win' rule. If I can make 'baba is win' instead, then reaching any Baba (myself) would be the win condition. But how?

To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Maybe there's a closer rule to manipulate.

Alternatively, the 'ball' rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps up. If I can move that to create 'baba is win', that would work. So steps needed: move to the 'ball' rule's position, then rearrange it.

To get to the 'ball' rule at 1 step right and 2 steps up, I have to navigate through the walls. From my current position (3 left), moving right once would hit the wall at 2 right, so can't go straight. Maybe move up first? Let's see. The wall at 2 steps right and 5 up is part of the upper structure. The 'ball' rule is at 1 right and 2 up. So maybe moving up two steps first, then right?

But moving up from the current position (assuming current is at 3 left), moving up would take me to the 'is' and 'stop' rules up there. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 up. Not helpful. Alternatively, move down to avoid walls.

If I move down once, I'm at the same level as the wall 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, maybe moving down to the key's position? The key is 4 right and 1 up. If I can get there, but the path is blocked.

Alternatively, use the 'ball' rule. If I can move the 'ball is' rule to say 'baba is win', that would make winning possible by reaching myself. So the plan: move to the 'ball' rule at 1 right and 2 up, then combine it with 'is' and 'baba' to create 'baba is win'.

To move the 'ball' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. Since the ball rule isn't tagged as stop, I can move it. So steps: move right to the 'ball' rule's position.

But how to get there. From current position (3 left), moving right is blocked by a wall at 2 right. So need to go around. Maybe move down first, then right, then up.

Let me try the path:

1. Move down from current position (3 left) to 3 left and 1 down. Is there a wall there? The map shows a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm at 3 left, moving down would place me at 3 left, 1 down. Is that a wall? Not directly, but the wall at 2 right and 1 down is separate. So maybe possible.

2. From there, move right. Now at 2 left, 1 down. Is there a wall? The walls are at 2 steps right in various positions. Wait, the positions are a bit confusing. Maybe each direction is relative to Baba's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move left, but the 'baba' rule is already at 3 steps left. So maybe that's the starting point.

Alternatively, use the existing rules to create a new path. For example, if I can make 'floor is stop' or remove 'wall is stop', but that's more complex.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So walls stop movement. To move past walls, I need to either remove the 'wall is stop' rule or make myself immune.

Alternatively, create a rule like 'baba is not stop', but that requires rearranging the existing rules.

But first, let's focus on moving the 'ball' rule. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it. The 'ball' rule is at 1 step right and 2 steps up from my current position (since the 'baba' rule is at 3 left). So from Baba's position, moving right once gets to the 'is' rule at 2 left, then right again hits the wall. So can't go that way.

Alternatively, move up two steps from Baba's position (3 left) to reach the 'ball' rule's position. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 up. Not helpful.

Wait, the 'ball' rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up from the 'baba' rule. So if Baba is at 3 left, then the 'ball' rule is at (3 left + 1 right) = 2 left, and 2 step up. So position: 2 left, 2 up.

To get there, from 3 left, move left once to 2 left, then up twice. But moving left from 3 left would be towards negative steps, which might not be possible. Maybe directions are relative. Alternatively, the coordinates are relative to the map's grid.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline possible moves step by step.

Current position: rule 'baba' is at 3 step to the left. So assuming that's the player's position.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `ball` is 1 step to the right and 2 step up from the 'baba' rule.

So from player's position (3 left), to get to the 'ball' rule (1 right, 2 up):

1. Move right once: but there's a wall at 2 steps right. So can't go there.

2. Move up twice: from 3 left, up twice would place me at 3 left, 2 up. Is there a wall there? The wall at 2 steps right and 2 step up exists, but that's to the right. So moving up twice from player's position would avoid that wall.

3. From 3 left, 2 up, move right once to reach the 'ball' rule's position (1 right, 2 up from 'baba' which is at 3 left). Wait, if 'baba' is at 3 left, then 1 right from there is 2 left, and 2 up would be 3 left, 2 up. Then the 'ball' rule is at 1 step right and 2 step up from 'baba', so that would be 2 left (3 left +1 right) and 2 up. So from player's position (3 left), moving up two steps gets to 3 left, 2 up. Then move left once to reach 2 left, 2 up, which is where the 'ball' rule is.

Wait, but the 'ball' rule's position is 1 step right and 2 step up from 'baba' rule. So if 'baba' is at 3 left, then adding 1 right makes it 2 left, and 2 up makes it 2 left, 2 up. So yes, that's the position of the 'ball' rule.

So the path would be:

- Move up from 3 left to 3 left, 1 up.

- Move up again to 3 left, 2 up.

- Move left once to 2 left, 2 up (where the 'ball' rule is).

Once there, the 'ball' rule can be moved. The player is 'you' (since baba is you), so can move the 'ball' rule.

Then, to create 'baba is win', need to combine 'baba', 'is', and 'win'.

The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 5 steps up. That's quite far. Alternatively, use the existing 'win' rule nearby. Wait, the 'win' rule is part of the key's rule: 'key is win' at 5 steps right and 5 up. Maybe there's a 'win' rule at 7 steps right and 5 up, which is separate.

Alternatively, take the 'win' rule that's part of the key's rule (5 right,5 up) and move it to combine with 'baba' and 'is'.

But to do that, need to move the 'win' rule from 7 right,5 up to somewhere near 'baba' and 'is'.

This seems complex. Alternatively, use the 'ball' rule to create a new rule.

If I move the 'ball' rule to near 'baba' and 'is', then can create 'baba is win'.

For example:

- Move the 'ball' rule to the position of 'is' (2 left,5 up).

- Then, combine 'baba', 'is', and 'win' to make 'baba is win'.

But moving the 'ball' rule there would require a series of moves.

Alternatively, since the 'ball' rule is already at 2 left,2 up, maybe move it down to the area where 'baba', 'is', and 'you' are located, which is at 3 left, 1 down (assuming).

This is getting a bit too vague. Maybe the immediate action is to move towards the 'ball' rule to manipulate it.

So the next action should be to move up twice and then left to reach the 'ball' rule. But how to translate that into the allowed actions (up, down, left, right, idle).

From current position (3 left), to get to the 'ball' rule at 2 left, 2 up:

- First action: up

- Second action: up

- Third action: left

But the system might require a single action per step. So each time, choose the direction.

So the first move should be 'up' to go to 3 left,1 up.

Then another 'up' to 3 left,2 up.

Then 'left' to 2 left,2 up, where the 'ball' rule is.

So the immediate action would be 'up' to start moving upwards.

Alternatively, if the system requires only one action per observation, then the next step is to move up.

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are still ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to reach the key, which is a win condition. But I need to get past the walls and possibly manipulate the rules if needed.

Looking at the objects on the map: there's a rule `baba` at 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. There's also a `rule is` and `rule you` nearby. The key is at 4 steps to the right. But how do I get there?

Wait, the current position of Baba is probably where the `rule baba` is, which is at 3 left and 1 down. So maybe I need to move towards the key. But the path is blocked by walls. Let me check the map again.

The walls are all to the right at various positions. The key is 4 steps to the right, but there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, and another wall at 2 steps right. So moving directly right might hit a wall. But maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to make the walls not stop me.

The `rule ball` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can change what ball does. But the ball itself is an object. Wait, the active rules don't mention ball being stop or win. The only stop is wall. So maybe if I can make ball a stop, then I can push it out of the way? Or maybe make myself ball to avoid the walls?

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", maybe I can combine rules. Like, move the `is` and `you` next to baba to make a new rule. For example, if I move `rule you` next to `rule baba`, then it would create ""baba is you"", which is already active. Not helpful. But what if I move `rule ball` next to `rule is` to make ""ball is ..."". But what property? If I can make ball a stop, then walls made of ball would block movement. But the key is win, which is still key. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right. There's a wall at 2 steps right, but maybe if I can remove the wall rule. The `rule stop` is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how? To move a rule, I need to push it using objects that are not stop. Since baba is you, which means I can push myself and any text blocks that are not stop.

So, the current rules are on the upper left. The `rule wall`, `rule is`, `rule stop` are all up there. The `rule key`, `rule is`, `rule win` are on the upper right. The `rule ball` is down a bit. Maybe I need to move the `rule stop` out of the way. Since wall is stop, but if I can remove the stop rule, then walls won't block me.

To move `rule stop`, which is 1 step left and 4 step up. I need to push it left or down. But can I? The objects around it are `rule wall` to the right, `rule is` to the right, and the wall at 2 steps right and 4 step up. So maybe I can push `rule stop` down. If I move down towards it, but I'm at 3 step left and 1 step down. So moving towards the `rule stop` would require moving right and up. Wait, maybe I can first move right to get closer.

Wait, the `rule baba` is at 3 step left and 1 step down. So my current position is there. To reach the `rule stop` at 1 step left and 4 step up, I need to move left twice and up three times. But the path might be blocked. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 4 step up, but I'm on the left side. Maybe I can push the `rule stop` down by moving it with the `rule is` or another rule. But how?

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", I can move the `rule stop` by pushing it with myself. If I move up towards it, but I have to avoid the walls. Let's see: from my position (3 left, 1 down), moving up would take me to 3 left, 0 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Wait, the walls are to the right, so maybe moving left or up is safer.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe another approach: since the key is win, and it's at 4 steps right, perhaps I need to find a way to reach there without hitting walls. The direct path is blocked by walls, but maybe there's a detour. If I can make the ball a stop, then pushing it out of the way could create a path. The `rule ball` is at 1 step right and 2 step up. If I can create ""ball is stop"", then the ball would act as a wall. But how?

To create ""ball is stop"", I need to place the `rule ball` next to `rule stop`. The `rule ball` is at 1 right, 2 up. The `rule stop` is at 1 left, 4 up. So maybe move the `rule ball` right and down to get next to `rule stop`. Let's see: from `rule ball` at 1 right, 2 up, moving right to 2 right, 2 up. But there's a wall at 2 right, 2 up. Can't move there. Alternatively, move down to 1 right, 3 up. Then maybe move right to 2 right, 3 up. But again, walls are there. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the `rule is` nearby. The `rule is` is at 2 left, 4 up. If I can move `rule is` down and right to connect with `rule ball` and `rule stop`. But this might take multiple steps. It's getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right. If I can reach there by moving right past the walls. But the wall at 2 steps right is a stop. Unless I can remove the stop rule. If I can remove ""wall is stop"", then walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the `rule stop` away. The `rule stop` is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can push it down to 1 left, 5 up, then maybe. To push it down, I need to be adjacent and move down. But I'm at 3 left, 1 down. How to get to 1 left, 4 up?

This might require a series of moves: first move right from 3 left to 1 left, then up to 4 up, then down to push the rule. But there are walls along the way. Let me map this out.

Starting position: 3 left, 1 down.

Move left to 2 left, 1 down.

Move left to 1 left, 1 down.

Now at 1 left, 1 down. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, but I'm on the left. From here, move up to 1 left, 2 down.

Up to 1 left, 1 down (wait, directions might be confusing). Maybe using coordinates where up increases the y-axis. Let me clarify the directions. Assume that up is positive y, right is positive x. The initial position of the rule `baba` is at (x=-3, y=-1) relative to some origin. The `rule stop` is at (x=-1, y=4). To reach there, need to move from (-3, -1) to (-1, 4).

So the path would be: right twice (to x=-1), then up four times (to y=4). But along the way, are there walls? At (x=-2, y=1) there's a wall. So moving right from (-3, -1) to (-2, -1) is possible if there's no wall. Wait, the walls listed are at specific positions. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 5 step up: So that's (x=2, y=5).

- wall 2 steps to the right and 4 step up: (x=2, y=4).

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: (x=2, y=3).

- etc. So the walls are all on the right side, x=2, varying y from 1 up to 5.

The `rule stop` is at (x=-1, y=4). To get there from (x=-3, y=-1), need to move right to x=-1 (two steps right), then up to y=4 (four steps up). The path is clear except for possible walls along the way. But the walls are at x=2, so on the right side. So moving left and up should be possible.

Once at (x=-1, y=4), which is where `rule stop` is located, I can push it down. To push a rule, I need to be adjacent and move in the direction opposite to where I'm pushing. So if I'm at (x=-1, y=4) (the rule stop), and I want to push it down to y=5, I need to be at (x=-1, y=3) and move up. Wait, no: to push a rule down, I need to be below it and move down. Wait, maybe the direction is such that if you want to move a rule to the left, you have to be to its right and move left.

This is a bit confusing. Let me think: if a rule is at (x, y), and I want to move it to (x-1, y), I need to be at (x, y) and move left. So to push the `rule stop` at (x=-1, y=4) down to (x=-1, y=5), I need to be at (x=-1, y=3) and move up. But am I allowed to do that? I need to check if the space below the rule (y=5) is free. If it is, then I can push it.

Assuming the space at (x=-1, y=5) is empty, I can move up from (x=-1, y=3) to (x=-1, y=4), which is the `rule stop`, and then push it down to (x=-1, y=5). But I need to get there. Let's see:

From my current position (x=-3, y=-1):

1. Move right twice to (x=-1, y=-1).

2. Move up four times to (x=-1, y=3).

3. Now, at (x=-1, y=3), move up to (x=-1, y=4) where the `rule stop` is.

4. Then, push the `rule stop` down to (x=-1, y=5) by moving down from (x=-1, y=4) to (x=-1, y=5). Wait, but to push a rule, you have to be adjacent and move in the direction you want to push. So to push down, I need to be below the rule and move down. But I'm at (x=-1, y=4), the rule is there. So I need to be at (x=-1, y=5) to push it down? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to be adjacent and move in the direction opposite. For example, to push a rule to the left, you move left from its current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the mechanics are that to push a rule in a direction, you have to be on the opposite side. Like, to push a rule to the left, you stand to its right and move left, carrying the rule with you.

So if the `rule stop` is at (x=-1, y=4), and I want to push it down (south), I need to be to its north (y=5) and move south into it. But if y=5 is empty, I can move into the rule and push it down.

But I'm currently at (x=-1, y=3). To get to (x=-1, y=4), I move up. Then, from there, I can push the rule down to y=5 by moving down. But does that work? If I move down from (x=-1, y=4) to (x=-1, y=5), taking the `rule stop` with me, then yes. But I need to ensure that the space at y=5 is free. Looking at the objects, there's a `rule win` at (x=7, y=5), so the space at (x=-1, y=5) is empty. So this should be possible.

By doing this, the `rule stop` would move to (x=-1, y=5), removing the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls would no longer be stop, and I could move through them. Then I could go to the key at (x=4, y=0) (assuming key is at 4 steps right, which is x=4, y=0). But how to get there without hitting walls?

Alternatively, once ""wall is stop"" is removed, the walls are just regular walls but not stop, so I can move past them. So from my position at (x=-1, y=5), I can move right towards the key. Let's see:

From (x=-1, y=5), moving right to x=0, y=5. Then right to x=1, y=5. Then right to x=2, y=5. But there's a wall at (x=2, y=5), but since ""wall is stop"" is removed, it's just a wall object. But can I move past it? Wait, the rules are ""wall is stop"", which makes walls act as stop. If I remove that rule, walls are just regular objects. But can I move through them? According to the game rules, you can only move objects that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar. So if ""wall is stop"" is removed, then walls are not stop, so I can push them or move around them.

So after removing ""wall is stop"", I can move right past the walls. So the path to the key at (x=4, y=0) would be possible by moving right, down, etc.

But this requires successfully moving the `rule stop` to y=5. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move from (x=-3, y=-1) to (x=-1, y=-1) by moving left twice.

2. Move up from y=-1 to y=4, passing through y=0, 1, 2, 3.

3. At (x=-1, y=4), which is the `rule stop`, move down to (x=-1, y=5), pushing the rule there.

Now, ""wall is stop"" is removed. Then, move right towards the key.

But how to execute this in the game? Each move is one step. So the actions would be:

- left, left

- up, up, up, up

- down

Then, with ""wall is stop"" removed, move right multiple times, avoiding walls since they're no longer stop.

But the key is at 4 steps right, which is x=4. From (x=-1, y=5), moving right four times gets to x=3, then x=4. But there's a wall at x=2, y=5. Since walls are no longer stop, can I move past them? Probably yes, but I might have to push them or navigate around.

Alternatively, after removing the stop rule, I can go directly to the key by moving right, down, etc.

But this seems like a possible solution. However, the problem is that in the current observation, after moving the `rule stop` down, the active rules would no longer include ""wall is stop"". Then, the path to the key would be clear.

So the immediate action needed is to move up to reach the `rule stop` and then push it down. But in the current observation, after the previous actions, where is the agent positioned?

Looking back at the history, the last action was ""up"", which moved the agent to a new position. The current observation shows that after moving up, the agent is at ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down"" — which is the same position as before? Or has it moved?

Wait, the observations after each action show the new state. The last action was ""up"", leading to a new observation where the rules might have changed, but in the current observation provided, the active rules are still the same: wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the ""up"" action didn't change the rules, just moved the agent.

In the current observation, the agent is at ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down"". So to reach the `rule stop` at (x=-1, y=4), the agent needs to move right twice and up four times.

But each move requires one action. So the next step would be to move right to get closer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is a win condition, and it's at 4 steps right, perhaps I can make the key a you rule. For example, create ""baba is key"", making Baba a key, which is win. But to do that, I need to move the `is` and `you` rules next to the key.

The `key` is at 4 steps right. The `rule you` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So maybe move `rule you` to the key's position. But the path is blocked by walls.

This seems tricky. Another idea: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can turn myself into the key. To do that, create ""baba is key"". The existing rule is ""key is win"", but if I can make ""baba is key"", then since baba is you, you would be key, which is win. So winning condition would be reached by being baba (you) which is key.

To create ""baba is key"", I need to place the `rule baba`, `rule is`, and `rule key` adjacent. The `rule baba` is already at 3 left, 1 down. The `rule is` is","

Let's see. I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get to the key, which is also labeled as win. But maybe that's a trick. Right now, I'm controlled by Baba, so since ""baba is you,"" moving Baba towards the key should work.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right. Wait, the wall is a stop, so I can't go through it. But maybe I can move the text blocks to change the rules. Let me check the positions.

There's a rule ""ball is"" somewhere? Wait, no. There's a rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up. So, the rule is ""ball [something]"". But right now, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the ball's rule isn't active. Maybe if I can change the rule to make ball be something else, like win or you.

Wait, the key is win, so if I can make the ball be win, then reaching the ball would win the level. But how? The key is to the right, but blocked by a wall. So maybe first, I need to move the wall out of the way by changing its rule. The wall's rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can change that to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove the rule, then the wall wouldn't block me.

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 3 steps left and 4 steps up. The ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks are nearby. So if I can grab the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, then the wall's rule would change. But wait, can I move the text blocks? The rules say that objects with ""STOP"" or similar properties can't be moved. But the ""stop"" here is part of the rule ""wall is stop"". So if the rule is active, then the wall is stop, meaning it's immovable. But maybe the text blocks themselves can be moved if they're not part of an active rule. Wait, no. Once a rule is formed, the subject and property are combined. So the ""wall is stop"" rule makes the wall a stop. To change that, I need to either move the ""stop"" text block away or rewrite the rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 1 step left and 4 steps up. If I can move that ""stop"" block elsewhere, then the original rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer be valid. But how to move it? Since the wall is a stop, I can't move it, but maybe the ""stop"" text block is separate. Wait, the rule is ""wall is stop"", which is made of three objects: rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. So each of those is a text block. To break the rule, I need to move one of those three. But the wall itself is a stop, so moving the wall is impossible. But can I move the ""stop"" text block that's part of the rule?

If I can move the ""stop"" text block, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken. Let's check the positions. The ""stop"" text block is at 1 step left and 4 steps up. The ""is"" is at 2 steps left and 4 steps up, and ""wall"" rule is at 3 steps left and 4 steps up. So these three form the ""wall is stop"" rule. To break it, I need to move at least one of them. But since the wall is a stop, can I move the other text blocks?

The ""is"" block is at 2 left, 4 up. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 4 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block to a different position, say next to the wall rule, then the rule would be broken. But how to move it? The player is Baba, which is you, so you can move unless blocked. The path to the ""stop"" block: from Baba's current position (assuming previous steps ended up somewhere), but looking at the latest observation, Baba's rule is at 3 step left and 1 step down. So Baba is at 3 left, 1 down. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 4 up. That's quite a distance. Let's see the layout.

The map has walls forming a corridor. The key is at 4 right, same level as the lower part. The ball is at 4 right, 3 up. The ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 1 down. So maybe the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 left, 1 down. To reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 4 up, the player would need to move up four steps and left two steps, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 3 left, 4 up there's a wall. So maybe the player can't reach the ""stop"" block directly.

Alternative approach: Instead of removing the ""wall is stop"" rule, maybe create a new rule that allows moving past the wall. For example, make the wall pushable or remove its stop property. To do that, we need to rewrite the rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three text blocks. If we can replace ""stop"" with another property, like ""push"" or remove it, that could work. But how?

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe reaching the key is sufficient. But the key is behind a wall. However, if we can make the wall not a stop, then we can go through it. For example, if we change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then the wall would be pushable. But to do that, we need to move the ""stop"" text block and add a ""push"" block instead.

But where is the ""push"" text block? Looking at the objects, there's no ""push"" rule mentioned. So we would need to create a new rule ""wall is push"" by moving the existing ""is"" and ""wall"" blocks and adding a ""push"" block. But since we don't have a ""push"" block on the map, this might not be possible. Unless there's a hidden block or we can create it by rearranging existing ones.

Wait, the available text blocks are probably the ones present on the map. Let's list them:

- rule `wall` at 3 left,4 up
- rule `is` at 2 left,4 up
- rule `stop` at 1 left,4 up
- rule `key` at 5 right,5 up
- rule `is` at 6 right,5 up
- rule `win` at 7 right,5 up
- rule `ball` at 1 right,2 up
- rule `baba` at 3 left,1 down
- rule `is` at 2 left,1 down
- rule `you` at 1 left,1 down

So the available text blocks are wall, is, stop, key, win, ball, baba, you. No push. So maybe we can't make wall push. Alternative idea: make the wall into a different object that isn't stop. For example, if we can make the wall into a ball, then since ball's rule is not stop (unless there's a rule saying ball is stop), but currently, the only active rule for ball is if we create it. The existing rule for ball is at 1 right,2 up: rule `ball`. So if we make a rule ""ball is stop"", then balls would be stop. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, make ""ball is you"" so that touching the ball makes us you, but that might not help here.

Wait, the goal is to get to the key, which is win. If we can make the key not be win, but something else, but that's counterproductive. Alternatively, make ourselves win. Since ""baba is you"", if we can make ""baba is win"", then touching any baba (which is you) would make us win. But how?

To create a new rule ""baba is win"", we need the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"". The ""win"" block is at 7 right,5 up. The ""is"" block is at 6 right,5 up and 2 left,1 down. The ""baba"" block is at 3 left,1 down. So if we can move these blocks together, we can create the new rule. But the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe interact with the existing rules. For example, the current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If we can make ""key is stop"", then the key would be a stop, but that's not helpful. Or make ""key is you"", so touching the key makes us you, but we already are you. Hmm.

Another angle: The ball is at 4 right,3 up. There's a rule `ball` at 1 right,2 up. If we can make ""ball is win"", then reaching the ball would win the level. The ball is currently not blocked by walls, except maybe the wall at 2 right,3 up. Wait, the wall at 2 right,3 up is a stop, so can't go through. But if we can remove that wall's stop property, then we could get past.

Wait, the wall at 2 right,3 up is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If we can break that rule, then the wall wouldn't be stop. So going back to the original thought, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block.

But how to reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left,4 up from Baba's current position at 3 left,1 down. The path would require moving left to 1 left, but there's a wall at 2 left,4 up. Maybe not directly possible. Alternatively, find another text block to create a new rule that allows movement.

Wait, the ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right,5 up. If we can move that rule, perhaps we can make the key do something else. But the key itself is at 4 right,1 up. To reach the rule blocks, we need to navigate around.

Alternatively, use the existing ""ball is"" rule. The rule `ball` is at 1 right,2 up. If we can add an ""is"" and a ""win"" to make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win. The ""win"" block is at 7 right,5 up. The ""is"" block is at 6 right,5 up. So if we can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to the ""ball"" rule, we can create ""ball is win"".

But moving those blocks would require moving them past other objects. The ""win"" block is at 7 right,5 up, which is far to the right. The ""is"" block is at 6 right,5 up. To get them to 1 right,2 up, we'd have to move them left, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 5 right,5 up is the rule `key`, and so on. It might be possible to slide them left, but the path is unclear.

Another idea: Since the key is win, and it's at 4 right,1 up, which is below the main corridor. If we can move the key to a different position, but the key is an object, not a rule. So unless we can create a rule that moves the key, which I don't think is possible in Baba Is You.

Wait, objects are pushed if they are pushable. But the key is win, and currently, there's no rule making it pushable. So maybe we can push the key by making it pushable. To do that, create a rule ""key is push"". But to do that, we need the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and ""push"". We have ""key"" and ""is"", but no ""push"". So that's not possible.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's recap. The player is Baba (you), needs to reach the key (which is win). Blocked by a wall. The wall's rule is ""wall is stop"". To bypass this, either:

1. Remove the ""stop"" property from the wall by moving the ""stop"" text block.
2. Change the wall's rule to something else that doesn't make it stop.
3. Create a new rule that allows moving past the wall, like making the wall pushable.
4. Make the ball be win instead, which is nearby and maybe easier to reach.

Option 4 seems more feasible. The ball is at 4 right,3 up. There's a rule `ball` at 1 right,2 up. If we can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make us win. To do that, we need to move the ""win"" and ""is"" blocks to the ""ball"" rule's position.

The ""win"" block is at 7 right,5 up, and ""is"" is at 6 right,5 up. To get them to 1 right,2 up, we need to move them left. But the path is blocked by other rules and walls. For example, moving left from 7 right,5 up would require passing through 6 right,5 up (which is the ""is"" block), then 5 right,5 up (which is the ""key"" rule), and so on. It's a long way, but perhaps possible by pushing?

Wait, can we push the ""win"" and ""is"" blocks? The ""win"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If we can break that rule by moving one of its components, then the ""win"" block becomes movable. For example, if we move the ""is"" block from 6 right,5 up to somewhere else, then the ""key is win"" rule would be broken, and the ""win"" block would be free to move. Then, we could move the ""win"" block to the ""ball"" rule's position.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 6 right,5 up to a new position, breaking the ""key is win"" rule.
2. Move the ""win"" block from 7 right,5 up to 1 right,2 up, adjacent to the ""ball"" rule.
3. Create the new rule ""ball is win"", making the ball the win object.
4. Then, move towards the ball at 4 right,3 up, which is now the win condition.

But how to execute this? Let's think about the movement.

Baba's current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 left,1 down. To reach the ""is"" block at 6 right,5 up, that's a distance of 9 steps right and 4 steps up. That's a long way, and there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 2 steps right from Baba's position, there's a wall at 2 right,1 up. So moving right directly is blocked.

Alternative route: Maybe go up first. From 3 left,1 down, move up to 3 left,4 up (but there's a wall there). Then left to 1 left,4 up (the ""stop"" block). But again, walls block the path.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's look again at the current objects. There's a rule `ball` at 1 right,1 step up. If we can make ""ball is you"", then touching the ball would make us you, but we already are you. Not helpful. Or ""ball is win"", which would make the ball the win condition.

To make ""ball is win"", we need the ""ball"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks adjacent. The ""win"" block is at 7 right,5 up. The ""is"" block is at 6 right,5 up. The ""ball"" rule is at 1 right,2 up. So the idea is to move the ""win"" and ""is"" blocks to the ""ball"" rule's location.

But how to move them? The ""win"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If we can break that rule by moving the ""is"" block from 6 right,5 up, then the ""win"" block becomes movable. Then, we can move the ""win"" block leftwards past the ""key"" rule at 5 right,5 up. But the ""key"" is an object, and unless it's pushable, we can't move it. The ""key is win"" rule makes it win, but not necessarily pushable. So pushing the ""win"" block would require it to be pushable, which it isn't unless there's a rule saying so.

This is getting too complex. Maybe a different approach: use the existing ""key is win"" rule. Since the key is at 4 right,1 up, which is below the main corridor, perhaps there's a way to reach it by moving through the lower part.

Looking at the lower part of the map: at 2 steps right,1 step down is a wall. The key is at 4 right,1 step up. So to get to the key, you need to go from 3 left,1 down (Baba's position) to 4 right,1 up. The path would be:

- Move right to 4 right,1 down (but there's a wall there).
- Move up to 4 right,1 up (the key). But can we get there?

Wait, the key is at 4 right,1 up. To get there, from Baba's position at 3 left,1 down:

1. Move right to 4 right,1 down (but there's a wall at 2 steps right,1 down: wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down). So cannot go that way.

Alternative path: Move up from 3 left,1 down to 3 left,4 up (but there's a wall there). Then move left? But that's not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the only way is to interact with the text blocks to change the rules. Let's focus on creating a new rule that allows us to pass the wall.

If we can make the wall not a stop, say ""wall is push"", then we could push it out of the way. But to do that, we need to create the rule ""wall is push"". The ""push"" text block isn't present, so we can't create it unless we have it on the map.

Alternatively, make ""wall is you"", so the wall becomes part of us. But ""baba is you"", so if","

81,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what's going on here. The active rules are still wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba, and walls are stop, meaning I can't move into them. The key is the win condition, so I need to get to the key. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 4 steps to the right. So my goal is to move right towards it. But let's check the layout.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` 3 steps to the left and 1 step down. That must be the text block that says ""BABA IS YOU"", so that's part of the current rules. The other text blocks are wall, is, stop, key, and ball. The ball has a rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up, making it a stop? Wait, no, the rule says wall is stop, but there's a rule `ball` there. So ball is whatever that rule defines. Since the rule `ball` is placed somewhere, maybe it's changing the property of ball. But the active rules still have wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So ball's property isn't changed by the active rules, unless there's a ""ball is stop"" or something, which I don't see.

Now, the key is 4 steps to the right. But the path to the right might be blocked. Let me visualize the map. From Baba's position (which is at the rule `baba` located 3 steps left and 1 step down from some reference point?), moving right would take me towards the key. But looking at the objects, there's a wall 2 steps to the right at various positions. For example, wall 2 steps to the right at 4 steps up, 3 steps up, etc. Also, there's a key at 4 steps to the right. So maybe the path to the right is blocked by walls except where the key is. Wait, the key is 4 steps to the right, but there's a wall 2 steps to the right and then some more steps. Let me check the exact positions.

The objects listed are:

- rule `wall` 3 left, 4 up
- rule `is` 2 left, 4 up
- rule `stop` 1 left, 4 up
- wall 2 right, 4 up
- rule `key` 5 right, 4 up
- rule `is` 6 right, 4 up
- rule `win` 7 right, 4 up
- wall 2 right, 3 up
- ball 4 right, 3 up
- wall 2 right, 2 up
- rule `ball` 1 right, 1 up
- wall 2 right, 1 up
- wall 2 right
- key 4 right
- rule `baba` 3 left, 1 down
- rule `is` 2 left, 1 down
- rule `you` 1 left, 1 down
- wall 2 right, 1 down
- wall 2 right, 2 down

So Baba is at the position of the `baba` rule, which is 3 steps left and 1 step down from wherever the reference is. Assuming the reference is the top-left corner, maybe. But perhaps it's better to focus on relative positions. If I'm at the `baba` rule, which is 3 left and 1 down, then moving right would take me towards the key at 4 right. Let's see the obstacles.

To the right of Baba's position, there's a wall 2 steps to the right at 4 up, 3 up, 2 up, 1 up, and then at the same level (0 down). Also, there's a key at 4 right. So the direct path to the right (same level) is blocked by walls every 2 steps. But the key is at 4 steps right, so maybe there's a way around. Alternatively, maybe moving up or down could help navigate around the walls.

Looking at the upper part, at 4 steps up, there's a wall 2 steps to the right. Then rule `key` at 5 right, 4 up. So if I could get past that wall, I might reach the key. But how? The wall is 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, maybe the positions are relative. Let me try to sketch a grid mentally.

Assuming Baba is at position (0,0), then:

- rule `wall` is at (-3, 4)
- rule `is` at (-2,4)
- rule `stop` at (-1,4)
- wall at (2,4)
- rule `key` at (5,4)
- etc.

But this might not be the exact coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps each step is relative to Baba's current position. The problem is that the map's layout is a bit unclear without a visual, but based on the descriptions, I need to infer.

The key is 4 steps to the right. So from Baba's position, moving right 4 times would reach the key. However, there's a wall 2 steps to the right at various positions. For example, wall 2 steps to the right is at 4 up, 3 up, etc. So moving right directly might hit those walls.

Alternatively, maybe moving up could get around the walls. For instance, moving up to 4 steps up, but there's a wall there at 2 steps right. Then rule `key` is at 5 steps right, 4 up. So if I could get to (5,4), that's where the key is. But how to get there without hitting walls.

Wait, the rule `key` is at 5 right, 4 up. So if I can reach that position, but it's behind a wall at 2 right, 4 up. So perhaps I need to move around. Maybe moving left first to get to a different path.

But the active rules are still wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So unless I can change the rules, like making a rule that says ""key is not stop"" or ""baba is key"", but I don't see the text blocks for that. The available text blocks are rule `wall`, `is`, `stop`, `key`, `win`, `ball`, and their positions.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 1 right and 1 up. So maybe I can move that rule somewhere to create a new rule. For example, if I can move the `ball` rule next to `baba` and `is`, then create ""BABA IS BALL"", which would make Baba a ball. Then, if ball has any properties, but the active rules don't mention ball's properties. However, there's a rule `ball` at 1 right, 1 up. So if I move that rule next to `baba` and `is`, I could create ""BABA IS BALL"", making Baba a ball. But what then? If ball isn't a stop, maybe I can pass through walls. But the active rules still have wall is stop, so unless there's a rule that overrides that, walls would still stop me.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the key's rule. The key is defined by rule `key` at 5 right, 4 up. If I can move that rule to be under a different subject, like ""BALL IS WIN"" or something, but I need the necessary text blocks. The available `is` and `you` rules are at 2 left, 1 down. So perhaps I need to move those.

But moving text blocks requires that they are not defined as stop. The only stop objects are walls, so any text block that's not a wall can be moved. The `baba`, `is`, `you`, `key`, `win`, `stop`, `wall`, and `ball` rules are all text blocks, but only the ones labeled as stop (walls) can't be moved. So the other text blocks can be moved.

So the plan could be:

1. Move the `is` and `you` rules from the lower left (3 left, 1 down) to somewhere near the `baba` rule to create a new rule, like ""BABA IS WIN"" or ""BABA IS KEY"".

Alternatively, create ""BALL IS YOU"" to become a ball, then maybe navigate through walls.

But let's think step by step. The key is at 4 steps right. To get there, need to move right past walls. Let's see the path:

From Baba's position (assuming it's at the `baba` rule, 3 left and 1 down), moving right:

- 1 step right: there's a wall 2 steps to the right? Wait, the wall at 2 steps right is at various positions. Maybe the walls are placed at specific coordinates. It's a bit confusing without the exact map, but perhaps there's a pattern.

Looking at the objects again:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
- So between 2 and 5 steps right at 4 up, there's a wall at 2, then the key at 5. So to get to the key at 5 right, 4 up, you need to move right from 2 to 5, but there's a wall at 2. Unless you can move around it.

Alternatively, moving up to 4 steps up, but there's a wall at 2 right, 4 up. So maybe move up to 4 up, then right to 5, but that's blocked by the wall. Alternatively, move up more.

At 3 steps up, there's a ball at 4 right. Then wall at 2 right, 3 up. So moving up to 3 up, right to 4, which is a ball. The ball has a rule `ball` at 1 right, 1 up. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, move to the upper right area. At 4 steps up, there's a wall at 2 right, then rule `key` at 5 right. So if I could get past the wall at 2 right, 4 up, I could reach the key.

But how? Maybe by pushing the wall? But walls are stop, so I can't move into them. Unless there's a way to move the wall rule.

Wait, the wall is defined by the rule `wall` at 3 left, 4 up, and there's a wall object at 2 right, 4 up. So the wall object's existence is because of the rule `wall` somewhere else. If I can move the `wall` rule away, then maybe the wall object disappears. But the rule `wall` is at 3 left, 4 up. So if I can move that rule, I could remove the wall property from wherever it's applied.

But to move the `wall` rule, I need to be able to move it, which requires that it's not a stop. Since the rule `wall` is a text block, and unless it's placed under a stop property, it can be moved. But the active rule is ""wall is stop"", which means any object named wall is stop. However, the text block `wall` itself is a rule, not an object. Wait, maybe the distinction is that text blocks are movable, while the objects they create (like wall) are affected by the rules. So the `wall` text block can be moved, but the wall object it creates is stop.

So perhaps the strategy is to move the `wall` rule to a different position so that the wall objects no longer exist, or to change their properties. But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, if I can make ""BABA IS STOP"", then I would be stop and couldn't move, which is bad. Alternatively, ""BALL IS STOP"", but that's not helpful.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So to change the rules, I need to rearrange the text blocks. For example, to make ""baba is win"", which would make Baba the win condition, allowing me to touch the key without needing to pick it up. But how?

The `baba` rule is at 3 left, 1 down. The `win` rule is at 7 right, 4 up. The `is` rule is at 2 left, 4 up and 2 left, 1 down. So if I can move the `is` rule from 2 left, 1 down to be next to `baba` and `win`, then create ""BABA IS WIN"". But to do that, I need to move the `is` block.

Looking at the current positions:

- rule `baba` is at 3 left, 1 down
- rule `is` is at 2 left, 1 down and 2 left, 4 up
- rule `you` is at 1 left, 1 down

So the `is` at 2 left, 1 down is adjacent to `baba` and `you`. If I can move that `is` block to be between `baba` and `win`, then I can create ""BABA IS WIN"". But where is `win` located? The `win` rule is at 7 right, 4 up. That's quite far from Baba's position.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer `win` object? No, the objects listed include the rule `win` at 7 right, 4 up, but the key is at 4 right. So the distance is significant.

Alternatively, create ""BABA IS KEY"" so that touching the key makes me win. To do that, I need to move the `is` and `key` rules next to `baba`.

The `key` rule is at 5 right, 4 up. So maybe move the `is` from 2 left, 1 down to be next to `baba` (3 left, 1 down) and `key` (5 right, 4 up). That seems complicated due to the distance.

Alternatively, focus on moving the `ball` rule. The `ball` rule is at 1 right, 1 up. If I can move it next to `baba` and `is`, then create ""BABA IS BALL"". Then, if ball has any properties, but the active rules don't specify. However, there's a rule `ball` at 1 right, 1 up, which might mean that any ball is stop? Or maybe not. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So unless there's a rule like ""ball is stop"", balls are just normal. But the presence of the `ball` rule might create a ball object where placed, which could be moved.

If I become a ball (BABA IS BALL), then since there's no rule saying ball is stop, I could potentially move through walls. But I need to test this assumption.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the `ball` rule (at 1 right, 1 up) to a position next to `baba` and `is`.
2. This would create the rule ""BABA IS BALL"".
3. Then, since ball is not defined as stop, I could move through walls.

Once I'm a ball, I could navigate around the walls to reach the key. Let's see:

If I can move right through the walls because I'm a ball (not stop), then I can go right past the walls at 2 right, 4 up, etc., and reach the key at 4 right.

But how to execute this:

- First, move the `ball` rule from 1 right, 1 up to a position adjacent to `baba` (3 left, 1 down) and `is` (2 left, 1 down). Wait, the `baba` rule is at 3 left, 1 down, and the `is` is at 2 left, 1 down. The `ball` rule is at 1 right, 1 up. So the distance is quite big. Maybe I need to move the `ball` rule down to the lower left area.

Alternatively, move the `ball` rule to the right and down to be near the `baba` and `is` rules.

Each move is one step in a direction. So from `ball` at 1 right, 1 up, moving down would take it to 1 right, 0 up. Then right to 2 right, 0 up, etc., until reaching near the `baba` and `is` rules at 3 left, 1 down. This would require multiple moves, which might not be feasible in one go, but perhaps the system allows multiple steps.

However, in each observation, the agent has to choose a single action. So the thought process needs to determine the best single action based on the current state.

Given the current observation, the key is 4 steps to the right. The path is blocked by walls, but if I can become a ball, I could move through them. To become a ball, I need to create the rule ""BABA IS BALL"" by moving the `ball` rule next to `baba` and `is`.

The `ball` rule is currently at 1 step right and 1 step up. To get it to the area of `baba` and `is`, which are at 3 left, 1 down, I need to move left and down.

From `ball` at (1R, 1U), moving left would take it to 0R, 1U, then to -1R, 1U (which is 3L if reference is Baba's position). Then down to -1R, 0U, etc., until reaching the `baba` and `is` rules at 3L, 1D.

But this requires multiple left and down moves. However, in the current step, I can only choose one action. So the best immediate action might be to move the `ball` rule left or down towards the `baba` and `is` area.

Alternatively, if moving the `is` rule instead. The `is` at 2L, 1D is adjacent to `baba` and `you`. If I can move that `is` rule to be next to `baba` and `win`, but `win` is far away.

Another option: Since the key is a win object, and currently key is win, touching the key would win the level. So maybe the intended solution is to reach the key by moving right, but navigating around the walls.

Looking at the path to the right from Baba's position (assuming it's at the `baba` rule, 3L, 1D):

- Moving right 1 step: ? There's a wall 2 steps to the right at various positions. Maybe at the same","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm controlled by the Baba object because ""baba is you"" makes me the player. My goal is to get to the key, which is labeled as win, but maybe I need to change that? Or perhaps the key is the win condition here.

Looking at the map, there's a key at 4 steps to the right. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right, and then the key. So I need to move right past the wall. Wait, but walls are stop, so I can't move into them. So how do I get past the wall? Maybe I can move the key or the wall? But the key is a win object, and walls are stop. Hmm.

Wait, there's a rule ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". Maybe I can manipulate that rule. If I can move the ball rule, maybe I can change what the ball is. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can make a rule that says ""baba is key"", then I could turn into the key and win. But how do I create that rule?

To create a new rule, I need to have the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""key"" in the correct positions. Let me check the objects on the map. There's a rule `baba` 3 steps to the left and 1 step down, a rule `is` 2 steps left and 1 step down, and a rule `you` 1 step left and 1 step down. So those are the parts to make ""baba is you"". If I move the ""you"" rule to the right next to ""baba"" and ""is"", I could change ""baba is you"" to something else. But I need to see if I can move those text blocks.

Wait, the rules are made of text blocks. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. To create ""baba is key"", I would need to move the ""key"" text block (which is a rule at 5 steps right and 5 steps up) somewhere. But those text blocks are probably not movable if they're part of active rules. Wait, no, the rules are formed by text blocks, but the text blocks themselves can be moved unless they're part of a STOP or similar rule. Since the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you, none of the text blocks are STOP, so they can be moved.

So the plan is: move the ""you"" text block from 1 step left and 1 step down to the right next to ""baba"" and ""is"" to change the rule from ""baba is you"" to ""baba is key"". Then, since I'm Baba and the rule says ""baba is key"", I would become the key, and since the key is the win condition, touching it would make me win.

But how to physically move those text blocks? Let's see their positions. The ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is 2 steps left and 1 step down. The ""you"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down. So they're all in a vertical line to the left. To make ""baba is key"", I need to replace ""you"" with ""key"". So I need to move the ""you"" rule to the right and place the ""key"" rule there.

First, I need to move the ""key"" rule, which is at 5 steps right and 5 steps up. That's way up there. To get there, I have to move right multiple times. But moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the default starting position, maybe near the ""baba"" rule?) Wait, the observation doesn't specify where the player is. Hmm, this is a problem. Without knowing my current position, it's hard to plan. But maybe I can figure it out based on the objects.

Looking at the objects, the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 step down from the player's current position? Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down"". So the player is somewhere, and the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 down from there. Similarly for other objects. So the player's position is the reference point. Let's assume the player is at position (0,0), and all other objects are relative to that.

So the ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -1). The ""is"" rule is at (-2, -1). The ""you"" rule is at (-1, -1). Then there are walls and the key at various positions to the right. So the player is probably to the left of the ""baba"" rule. To reach the ""you"" rule, which is at (-1, -1), the player would need to move right once. But moving right from (0,0) to (1,0) would be step right. But is that a wall? Let's check the objects.

Looking at the objects: wall 2 steps to the right, wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, etc. So moving right once from (0,0) would be to (1,0). Is there a wall there? Yes, there's a wall 2 steps to the right, but that's at (2,0). Wait, the wall at 2 steps right is at (2,0). So moving right once to (1,0) is clear. Then from (1,0), moving right again to (2,0) is a wall. So I can't go past that.

So to get to the ""you"" rule at (-1, -1), which is to the left of the player, the player needs to move left. But the player is at (0,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -1). So moving left three steps would reach the ""baba"" rule. But between (0,0) and (-3,-1), are there any walls? Let's check. The walls are at 2 steps to the right and various ups and downs, but nothing to the left. So moving left from (0,0) to (-1,0), then to (-2,0), then to (-3,0), but the ""baba"" rule is at (-3,-1), so one more step down. Wait, directions are a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the player's position is such that the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 down. So if the player is at (3,1), then the ""baba"" rule is at (0,0). But this is getting too complicated without a visual. Perhaps a better approach is to focus on the text blocks needed to create the new rule.

The key is at 5 steps right and 5 steps up. To get there, the player would have to move right 5 times and up 5 times, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 2 steps right and 5 up there's a wall. So moving up is also blocked. Maybe the player needs to rearrange the text blocks instead of moving through the walls.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is key"" by moving the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""key"" text block is currently at (5,5) if the player is at (0,0). To move it to near the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules at (-3,-1), the player would have to carry the ""key"" text block through the grid, moving around the walls. But this would require a series of moves right, up, left, etc., which is complex.

Alternatively, use the existing ""ball"" rule. There's a rule `ball` at 1 step right and 1 step up. Maybe change ""ball"" to ""key"", but I'm not sure how that helps. If I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. But the key is already the win condition. Hmm.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the key is the win object. If I can reach the key, then I win. But there's a wall at 2 steps right, blocking the path. The key is at 4 steps right. So how to get past the wall? Maybe push the wall? But can I push it? The rules don't say anything about push, so probably not. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing, but I don't think so.

Another idea: maybe make the wall not a stop. If I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you"", then walls would be passable, and I could move through them. But to do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks for the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of three text blocks: rule `wall` at 3 left 4 up, rule `is` at 2 left 4 up, and rule `stop` at 1 left 4 up. So they're vertically aligned 3, 2, 1 steps left and 4 up. To change this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. For example, replace ""stop"" with ""you"". But how?

The ""stop"" text block is at 1 left 4 up. If I can move that to another position, maybe next to ""wall"" and ""is"" but with a different property. But to do that, I need to carry the ""stop"" text block. Let's see where it is. The ""stop"" rule is 1 step left and 4 steps up from the player. So if the player moves left and up, they could pick up the ""stop"" text block and move it elsewhere.

But this requires navigating through the grid. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move to the ""stop"" text block's location (1 left, 4 up).
2. Pick it up and move it to a new position, say next to ""wall"" and ""is"" but with ""you"" instead.
3. This would change the rule from ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", making walls passable.
4. Then, move right past the walls to the key.

But this is a lot of steps. Let's see if the player can do this.

First, the player's current position isn't specified, but the ""baba"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 down. Assuming the player is to the right of the ""baba"" rule, say at position (3,1), then the ""stop"" rule is at (3 - 1, 1 - 4) = (2, -3). That seems far. Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position where the ""baba is you"" rule starts. This is getting too complicated without a clear map.

Alternatively, focus on the immediate area. The ""you"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down from the player. If the player moves left once, they can reach the ""you"" rule. Then, if they can swap it with the ""key"" rule, they can create ""baba is key"". But how to get the ""key"" rule nearby.

The ""key"" rule is at 5 steps right and 5 steps up. So the player would have to move right 5 and up 5, but there are walls. For example, at 2 steps right and 5 up is a wall. So moving up is blocked. Maybe the player needs to move around the walls by going down first.

This is really tricky. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""you"" rule next to the ""key"" rule to make ""you is key"", but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, create a rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 steps up. Again, moving there is blocked by walls. Hmm.

Another approach: since the key is the win object, maybe just move towards it and hope there's a way around. But the path is blocked by a wall at 2 steps right. So perhaps push the wall by rearranging text blocks. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I can move through it. But how?

Alternatively, use the ball rule. The rule `ball` is at 1 step right and 1 step up. If I can make ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. But the key is already the win. Maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, the active rules are key is win. So if I can touch the key, I win. The key is at 4 steps right. But the path is blocked by a wall at 2 steps right. So how to get past the wall? Maybe move the wall by rearranging its rule. The wall's rule is ""wall is stop"", which is made up of three text blocks. If I can change that rule, the wall's property changes.

To change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", I need to move the text blocks. Let's say I want to change it to ""wall is you"". Then I need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"". The ""stop"" text block is at 1 left 4 up. If I can move that to the position where ""you"" is, but that's at 1 left 1 down. That's a far distance.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is key"" by moving the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"". The ""key"" text block is at 5 right 5 up. To get there, the player would have to move right 5 and up 5, but there's a wall at 2 right 5 up. So maybe move down first, then around.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""you"" rule to the right next to ""baba"" and ""is"" with ""key"" instead. To do that, the player needs to pick up the ""you"" rule and move it, then place the ""key"" rule there.

Assuming the player is near the ""you"" rule at 1 left 1 down, moving left once to reach it. Then, pick it up and move right to the position where ""baba"" and ""is"" are. The ""baba"" and ""is"" are at 3 left 1 down, 2 left 1 down. So moving right from the ""you"" position (1 left 1 down) to 2 left 1 down, then to 3 left 1 down, placing the ""you"" as ""key"". Then the rule becomes ""baba is key"", making the player a key, which is the win condition.

So the steps would be:

1. Move left to reach the ""you"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""you"" rule.
3. Move right past the wall (but wait, there's a wall at 2 steps right. How? If the player is moving right from the ""you"" position, which is 1 left 1 down, moving right would go to 0 left 1 down, then 1 left 1 down, etc. Wait, directions might be relative. This is getting too confusing without a grid.

Alternatively, focus on the fact that the ""you"" rule is adjacent to the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules. If the player can swap ""you"" with ""key"", they can create the desired rule.

But to do that, the player needs to move the ""key"" text block into position. The ""key"" text block is at 5 right 4 up. So the player would have to move right 5 and up 4, but there are walls.

This seems impossible. Maybe the solution is to move the ""ball"" rule. The rule `ball` is at 1 right 1 up. If I can make ""baba is ball"", then since the ball might have a different property. But the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The ball's rule is ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". So the ball's property isn't defined. If I can make ""baba is ball"", then I become the ball, and if there's a rule that makes ball win, but there isn't. The win is still key.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the intended action is to move down towards the key. But how?

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right. If I can move right four times, but the wall at 2 steps right blocks that. So perhaps I need to move around the wall by going down. For example, move down from the key's position, but the key is at 4 right, so moving down from there would be 4 right and 1 down. Is there a way through?

Alternatively, use the ball. The ball is at 4 right 3 up. Maybe if I move the ball to the key's position, but I'm not sure.

I think the correct approach is to create the rule ""baba is key"" by rearranging the text blocks. To do that, the player needs to move the ""you"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"" with ""key"" instead. The steps would involve moving the ""you"" rule to the right and placing the ""key"" rule there. However, given the player's position and the locations of the text blocks, this requires precise movements.

Assuming the player is at the starting position near the ""baba"" rule, they need to navigate to the ""you"" rule, pick it up, move it to the right, and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"", then place the ""key"" rule there. This would involve multiple moves: left, left, left to reach the ""baba"" rule, then up or down, but this is speculative.

Alternatively, the simplest valid action that can be taken immediately is to move left towards the ""you"" rule to interact with it. So the chosen action is left.

Let's see. The current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So I'm Baba because of ""baba is you"". My goal is to reach the key, which is defined as win. There's a key at 5 steps to the right. But there are walls in the way. Let me look at the objects on the map.

Looking at the map layout, there's a rule `ball` at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ball is probably a movable object since it's not part of the active rules unless modified. The wall is stop, so I can't go through them. The key is 5 steps to the right, but there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, maybe I need to move the key or the ball?

Wait, the active rules are still key is win, so the key is the win object. But how do I get past the walls? The walls are 2 steps to the left and 4 up, then 3 steps right and 4 up, etc. Maybe I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make the ball a stop, or change the win condition to something else.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 2 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that rule next to ""win"", maybe I can change ""key is win"" to ""ball is win"". Then the ball would be the win object. But how to get there? The key is at 5 steps right, but the ball is at 2 steps right and 1 up. Let me check the positions again.

Current position of Baba: rule `baba` is 2 steps left and 1 down. So my position is 2 left and 1 down from where? Maybe relative to the center. So to move towards the key, I need to go right. But the walls are blocking the path. The walls are at 3 steps right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. So maybe there's a way to move the ball rule to the key's position.

But first, I need to reach the ball rule. The ball rule is at 2 right and 1 up from Baba's position. So from Baba's current position (2 left, 1 down), moving up once would get to rule `ball`. But wait, Baba's position is where the ""rule baba"" is located. Wait, the rule `baba` is 2 steps left and 1 step down. So that's Baba's position. So to move up, that's one step up. Let me check if moving up is possible.

The walls are at 3 steps right and 4 up, but nearby, there's a wall at 3 right and 1 up. Wait, the wall 3 steps to the right is at the base level. So from Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), moving up would take me to 2 left and same horizontal, 1 up. Is there a wall there? Let me see the objects. There's a rule `stop` at 4 step up, but that's up. Wait, the rule `stop` is 1 step to the left and 4 step up. So if I move up from Baba's position, I might hit a wall?

Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me try to visualize the map. The walls are spread out in different parts. The key is at 5 steps right. The ball is at 2 right and 1 up. So maybe moving up to the ball rule first. But how?

If I move up from Baba's position (rule `baba` at 2 left, 1 down), moving up once would place me at 2 left, same horizontal, 1 up. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up. But that's to the right of Baba's position. So moving up from Baba's position isn't blocked by a wall. Then, I can move up, then maybe right to reach the ball rule.

Alternatively, maybe moving left first. But the goal is to get to the key. Let me think. The key is at 5 steps right. To get there, I need to pass through walls. But walls are stop, so I can't move through them. Unless I can push them, but I think in Baba Is You, you can only move objects that are not stop. So the walls are stop, meaning they can't be moved.

So the only way is to find a way to bypass the walls by changing the rules. For example, if I can make the ball a stop, then I can push it out of the way. Or change the win condition to the ball. Let's see.

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the key is win. If I can change ""key is win"" to ""ball is win"", then the ball becomes the target. Then I can go get the ball instead. But how to do that?

The ball has a rule at 2 steps right and 1 up: rule `ball`. If I can move that rule next to ""win"", which is at 7 steps right and 4 up. To do that, I need to move the rule `ball` to the position where ""win"" is. But how?

The rule `ball` is at 2 right and 1 up. To get to the ""win"" rule (7 right, 4 up), I need to move right 5 steps and up 3 steps. But the path is blocked by walls and other rules. Maybe I can move the rule `ball` step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can make the ball a stop by combining it with the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. If I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""ball"" rule, then it becomes ""ball is stop"". Then the ball would be a stop, blocking movement. But that might not help unless I can push it out of the way.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba"" a ""win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". The ""win"" rule is at 7 right and 4 up. My position is 2 left and 1 down. Moving all the way there would take a lot of steps, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, let's think of moving the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. Since Baba is ""you"", maybe changing that. But not sure.

Wait, the key is at 5 steps right. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule to somewhere else, maybe making ""key"" not a win. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so unless I can break that rule by moving the ""is"" or ""win"" parts.

Alternatively, maybe use the ball to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""ball is win"", then the ball becomes the target. The ball is at 2 right and 1 up. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right and 4 up. So I need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ball. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule left and down.

But how to move the ""win"" rule? The ""win"" rule is part of the active rules, but I think I can move its text block if it's not stopped. Since ""win"" is a property, but the rule ""win"" is a text block that can be moved unless it's part of a stopped object. Wait, the ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 up. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up, but that's not affecting the ""win"" rule.

So, if I can move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to the ball's rule, then ""ball is win"" would be created. Let's see. The ball's rule is at 2 right and 1 up. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right and 4 up. To get them adjacent, I need to move the ""win"" rule left and down. Each move is one step.

But moving the ""win"" rule from 7 right,4 up to 2 right,1 up would require moving left 5 times and down 3 times. That's a lot, but perhaps possible. However, I need to pathfind around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up. Let's see the surrounding objects. To the left of the ""win"" rule, there's a rule `is` at 6 right,4 up, then rule `key` at 5 right,4 up. So to the left of ""win"" is ""key is win"" structure. So moving left from ""win"" would require moving past ""key"" and ""is"".

But maybe I can move the ""win"" rule down to 7 right,3 up, then left to 6 right,3 up, etc. But there's a wall at 3 right,3 up. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""key is win"" rule apart. If I can break that rule, then the key is no longer win. But how? The rule is ""key is win"", so if I can move the ""is"" or ""win"" part away, the rule is destroyed. For example, moving the ""win"" part away from ""key"".

The ""key"" is at 5 right,4 up. The ""is"" is at 6 right,4 up. The ""win"" is at 7 right,4 up. So they form ""key is win"". If I can move the ""win"" rule to the right, then the rule becomes ""key is [nothing]"", which would deactivate ""key is win"". Then the key would no longer be the win object. But then what? Maybe the ball becomes win, or I become win.

If I can make Baba the win by moving the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". The ""win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up. Baba's rule is at 2 left,1 down. That's a significant distance. But maybe possible by moving the ""win"" rule left and down.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" rule next to Baba. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from 7 right,4 up to near Baba's position (2 left,1 down). That's moving left 9 steps and down 3 steps. That's a lot, but perhaps possible if there's a path.

Looking at the walls, the path from 7 right,4 up to 2 left,1 down would go through several walls. For example, at 3 right,4 up there's a wall. So moving left from 7 right,4 up to 3 right,4 up would hit a wall. So that path is blocked. Maybe another route.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule down to 7 right,3 up, then left past the walls. But there's a wall at 3 right,3 up. So moving left from 7 right,3 up to 3 right,3 up is blocked. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to focus on the ball. The ball is at 2 right,1 up. There's a rule `ball` there. If I can move that rule next to the ""win"" rule, then ""ball is win"" would be created. Let's see. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up. The ball's rule is at 2 right,1 up. To get them adjacent, I need to move the ""ball"" rule right 5 times and up 3 times. That's a lot, but maybe possible.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule left and down to be next to the ball's rule. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up. Moving left 5 steps to 2 right,4 up. Then down 3 steps to 2 right,1 up. That would place the ""win"" rule next to the ball's rule. Then ""ball is win"" is created.

To move the ""win"" rule left 5 steps from 7 right,4 up to 2 right,4 up: each left move is possible if there's no wall. Looking at the map, between 7 right and 2 right at 4 up, there are objects: wall at 3 right,4 up; rule `key` at 5 right,4 up; rule `is` at 6 right,4 up. So moving left from 7 right,4 up, the first step is to 6 right,4 up, which is occupied by rule `is`. Can I move past that? No, because rule `is` is a text block, but unless it's stopped. The active rule is wall is stop, but rule `is` isn't a wall, so it can be moved. Wait, but to move the ""win"" rule left, I need to move it past the ""is"" and ""key"" rules. But those are text blocks that can be moved unless they're part of a stopped object.

So, the ""win"" rule is at 7 right,4 up. To move left, I need to move it next to the ""is"" rule at 6 right,4 up. Then, if I move the ""win"" rule left again, it would be at 6 right,4 up, pushing the ""is"" rule to 5 right,4 up. Then continue moving left, pushing the ""is"" and ""key"" rules out of the way. But this would require moving multiple text blocks, which might be possible.

Once the ""win"" rule is at 2 right,4 up, then moving it down to 2 right,1 up, which is next to the ball's rule. Then ""ball is win"" is created, making the ball the target. Then I can go get the ball at 5 right,3 up (since the ball is at 4 right,3 up according to the objects). Wait, the ball is at 4 steps to the right and 3 step up. Hmm.

But if the ball is now the win object, I need to reach it. The ball is at 4 right,3 up. There's a wall at 3 right,3 up. So I can't go through that. Unless I can move the wall. But wall is stop, so it can't be moved. So maybe I need to push the ball past the wall. But the ball's rule is at 2 right,1 up. If the ball is a stop, then it can't be moved. Wait, if ""ball is stop"", then the ball itself is stop. But if ""ball is win"", then the ball is win but not necessarily stop. So maybe I can move the ball past the wall.

Wait, the ball is an object. If it's defined as win but not stop, then I can move it. So if I can create ""ball is win"" and ""ball is not stop"", then I can move the ball. But the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. There's no rule defining ball's properties except the ""rule `ball`"" which is a text block, not a property rule. So if I make ""ball is win"", then the ball becomes win, but its stop property is not defined, so it's movable.

So, the plan is: move the ""win"" rule to be next to the ""ball"" rule, creating ""ball is win"". Then move the ball past the wall to reach it. The ball is at 4 right,3 up. There's a wall at 3 right,3 up. So to move the ball right from 4 right,3 up to 5 right,3 up would require moving past the wall at 3 right,3 up. But the ball is at 4 right,3 up, so moving right would take it to 5 right,3 up, which is next to the key (which is at 5 right,4 up). There's no wall at 5 right,3 up, I think. Let me check the objects.

Looking at the objects, the walls are at specific positions: 2 left and 4 up, 3 right and 4 up, 3 right and 3 up, etc. So at 5 right,3 up, there's no wall. So if the ball is moved to 5 right,3 up, that's clear. Then I can go get the ball.

But how to move the ball? Since it's now win, and not stop, I can move it. So after creating ""ball is win"", I can move the ball right past the wall at 3 right,3 up. Wait, the ball is at 4 right,3 up. Moving right would take it to 5 right,3 up, which is allowed. Then I can move to the ball's position and grab it, since it's the win object.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""win"" rule from 7 right,4 up to adjacent the ""ball"" rule at 2 right,1 up. This requires moving left past the ""key"" and ""is"" rules, then down to 2 right,1 up.

2. Once ""ball is win"" is active, move the ball from 4 right,3 up to 5 right,3 up.

3. Then move to the ball's new position to win.

But how to execute this movement step by step?

First, I need to get to the ""win"" rule at 7 right,4 up. My current position is the ""baba"" rule at 2 left,1 down. So I need to move right and up to reach the ""win"" rule.

The path from 2 left,1 down to 7 right,4 up would involve moving right 9 steps and up 3 steps. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 3 right,4 up there's a wall. So I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, move up first. From Baba's position (2 left,1 down), moving up once gets to 2 left, same horizontal, 1 up. Is that blocked? Let's see. There's a wall at 3 right,1 up, but that's to the right of Baba's position. So moving up from Baba's position is possible.

Then move right towards the ""win"" rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Maybe a better approach is to move the ""win"" rule instead of moving myself.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""ball"" rule. The ""ball"" rule is at 2 right,1 up. If I can move that rule up to be next to the ""win"" rule at 7 right,4 up. But that's a long way.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since the","

84,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what the next move should be here. The active rules are still the same: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, my goal is to get to the key or maybe change the win condition. Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 5 steps to the right. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right blocking that path. The key is part of the ""key is win"" rule, so normally getting to the key would win the level. But the wall is a stop, which means I can't pass through it.

Now, I need to check if there are any movable text blocks that can change the rules or paths. There's a rule ""ball is"" (I think it's ""rule 'ball' 1 step to the right and 1 step up"") which might be part of a rule that can be manipulated. If I can move that ball rule somewhere, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key"", then touching the key would make me win. Alternatively, maybe turning the wall into something else.

Looking at the current setup, the ""rule 'ball' 2 steps to the right and 1 step up"" is close to the key. If I can move that ball rule to where the 'is' and 'key' are, I could create a new rule like ""ball is key"" or ""ball is win"". But to do that, I need to move the ball rule piece. However, I need to check if those pieces are movable. Since the rules state that only non-stop objects can be moved. The wall is stop, but the text blocks like 'is', 'key', 'win', etc., are probably movable unless they're part of a stop rule. Here, the wall is defined as stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be. So I can try moving the 'ball' rule.

So the plan is: move the 'rule ball' piece to combine with 'is' and 'key' to create a new rule. For example, moving the ball next to 'is' and 'key' to make ""ball is key"", making the ball a key. Then, since I'm Baba and I'm you, touching the ball would make me win. Alternatively, make ""baba is win"".

Looking at the positions: the 'rule ball' is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The 'is' is at 7 steps right and 4 step up, and 'key' is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. Wait, maybe the positions are a bit different. Let me parse the objects again.

Current objects:

- rule `wall` 2 left, 4 up
- rule `is` 1 left, 4 up
- rule `stop` 4 up (position not sure, maybe same line?)
- wall 3 right, 4 up
- rule `key` 6 right, 4 up
- rule `is` 7 right, 4 up
- rule `win` 8 right, 4 up
- wall 3 right, 3 up
- ball 5 right, 3 up
- wall 3 right, 2 up
- rule `ball` 2 right, 1 up
- wall 3 right, 1 up
- wall 3 right
- key 5 right
- rule `baba` 2 left, 1 down
- rule `is` 1 left, 1 down
- rule `you` 1 down
- wall 3 right, 1 down
- wall 3 right, 2 down

So the 'rule ball' is at 2 right, 1 up. To create a new rule, I need to combine it with 'is' and another property. For example, if I can move 'rule ball' next to 'is' and 'key', then it would become ""ball is key"". Then, since I'm Baba and I'm you, if I touch the key (which is now also a ball), I'd win. Alternatively, moving 'rule ball' next to 'is' and 'win' to make ""ball is win"".

Looking at the positions, the 'key' is at 6 right, 4 up, and 'is' is at 7 right, 4 up. The 'rule ball' is at 2 right, 1 up. So moving the 'rule ball' down to the same horizontal line as the 'is' and 'key' might be possible. Let's see:

From 2 right, 1 up, moving down steps would get to 2 right, 2 up, then 3 up, etc. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 up and 1 up. So moving down from 2 right, 1 up would hit the wall at 3 right, 1 up. Wait, the wall at 3 right, 1 up is directly below the 'rule ball'? Maybe not. The 'rule ball' is at 2 right, 1 up. The wall at 3 right, 1 up is one step to the right. So perhaps I can move the 'rule ball' down to 2 right, 2 up, but there's a wall at 3 right, 2 up. Wait, the walls are at 3 right, 4 up; 3 right, 3 up; 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 1 up; etc. So moving the 'rule ball' down from 2 right, 1 up would go to 2 right, 2 up. Is that possible? The path is clear? Let's check:

From 2 right, 1 up, moving down (since the user's position isn't shown, but the action is relative to Baba's position). Wait, the problem is that the assistant doesn't know Baba's current position. The observations list the objects relative to the player's position? Or are the coordinates absolute? This is a bit unclear. Assuming that the coordinates are relative to Baba's position, then moving left/right/up/down changes his position.

But without knowing Baba's location, it's tricky. However, looking at the objects, the 'rule baba' is at 2 left and 1 down. So maybe Baba is at position (0,0), and the 'rule baba' is 2 steps left and 1 down, meaning Baba is at 2 right and 1 up from the rule baba's position. This is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are in a grid where the player is somewhere, and the objects are placed relative to that.

Alternatively, maybe the player (Baba) is at a certain position, and the objects are listed with their relative positions. For example, 'rule baba' is 3 steps to the left and 1 step down from the player. So if the player is at (0,0), then the rule baba is at (-3, 1). The 'is' next to it is 1 step to the left and 1 down, so (-4, 2). The 'you' is 1 step down, at (-3, 2). Then the walls and other objects are placed relative to the player's position.

In this scenario, the key is at 4 steps to the right, so (4,0). But there's a wall at 3 steps right (3,0), so the player can't go straight right. The 'rule ball' is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, which is (2,1). To reach the key at (4,0), the player needs to go around the wall. But how?

If the player can move the 'rule ball' to combine with 'is' and 'key', then creating a new rule. For example, moving the 'rule ball' to (6,4) where 'key' is, but that's 4 steps right and 3 steps up from (2,1). That's a long move, and there might be walls in the way. Alternatively, moving the 'rule ball' to the area where 'is' and 'key' are located, which is at 6 right and 4 up. From (2,1), moving right 4 steps and up 3 steps would get there, but there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe combine 'rule ball' with 'is' and 'win' to make ""ball is win"". The 'win' rule is at 8 right,4 up. From (2,1), moving right 6 steps and up 3 steps would reach there, but again, walls are in the way.

Another approach: Maybe the player can push the ball over the wall. Since the ball is an object, and if it's not defined as stop, maybe the player can move it. The ball is at (5,3) according to previous observations, but in the current observation, the ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up. If the player can move the ball out of the way, then proceed to the key. But how?

Alternatively, since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe renaming Baba to win. For example, moving 'rule you' next to 'baba' and 'win' to create ""baba is win"". The 'you' rule is at 1 step down from the player's position (assuming player is at (0,0)), so the 'you' is at (0,-1). The 'baba' rule is at (-3,1). The 'win' rule is at (8,4). This seems complicated.

Alternatively, look for the 'key' which is win. If I can reach the key, but it's blocked by a wall. So I need to move the wall. But the wall is 'stop', so only if I change its property. Maybe create a rule that says 'wall is nothing' or 'wall is you', allowing me to move through it. To do that, I need to find the 'stop' rule and break it.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 4 up. So relative to the player's position (0,0), it's at (-1,4). The 'is' next to it is at (-2,4). So if I can move the 'stop' rule away or replace it, perhaps by moving the 'ball' rule next to 'is' and 'stop' to make ""stop is ball"", making the wall a ball, which might be movable.

So the plan is: move the 'rule ball' (at 2 right, 1 up) to the area of 'stop' and 'is'. From (2,1), move left to reach (-1,4) where 'stop' is. But that's a distance of 3 steps left and 3 steps up. That's a long move, and there are walls in the way, like the wall at 3 right, 4 up (which is (3,4) relative to player at (0,0)), which is blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. If the player can move the 'rule ball' down to (2,2), then left to (1,2), then up to (1,4), then left to (-1,4) where 'stop' is. But need to check if those moves are possible. The path from (2,1) down to (2,2) is possible if there's no wall. Then left to (1,2), then up to (1,4), then left to (-1,4). But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the objects, at 3 right, 2 up there's a wall. So from (2,2) moving right would hit the wall at (3,2). So that path is blocked. Alternatively, moving down from (2,1) to (2,2), then left to (1,2), but (1,2) is clear? Not sure. Maybe this is too complicated.

Another idea: Since the key is a win, maybe instead of moving through the wall, change the key's position. If I can move the 'rule key' (which is at 6 right,4 up) to somewhere else, but that might not help. Alternatively, make the ball a win by creating ""ball is win"". If the ball is at (5,3), and the 'win' rule is at (8,4), perhaps moving the 'ball' rule next to 'win'. But the ball is a separate object; moving it would require pathing around walls.

Alternatively, use the existing 'rule ball' at (2,1) to create a new rule. If I can move the 'rule ball' next to 'is' and 'win', then ""ball is win"" would be created. The 'win' is at (8,4), so from (2,1), moving right 6 steps and up 3 steps. But there's a wall at (3,4), so that's blocked.

This is getting really tricky. Maybe the simplest solution is to try to move towards the key and find a way around the wall. Since the key is at 4 steps right, but there's a wall at 3 steps right. If I can move the wall, perhaps by changing its rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is at (-1,4). If I can move that rule away, then the wall wouldn't be stop anymore. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule. But how?

The 'stop' rule is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So if I can break that by moving the 'stop' text block. The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 4 up, which is (-1,4). If I can move the 'stop' text block to another position, like combining it with another rule. For example, moving 'stop' next to 'ball' and 'is' to make ""ball is stop"", turning the ball into a stop. But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says 'wall is you', making the wall something I can move through. To do that, I need to create ""wall is you"" by moving 'you' next to 'wall' and 'is'. The 'you' rule is at (0,-1), and 'wall' is at (-1,4). So from (0,-1), moving up to (0,0), then right to (1,0), etc., but it's unclear.

Wait, maybe the player is at a position where they can push objects. For example, if the ball is next to a wall, the player can push the ball into the wall, changing its position. But I'm not sure if that's possible in Baba Is You.

Another approach: Since the key is win, and the player is Baba who is you, maybe just reach the key. But the path is blocked. So perhaps move the wall by rearranging the rules. The 'wall is stop' rule is at (-1,4). If I can move that rule away, the wall would no longer be stop. For example, moving the 'stop' part of the rule to another object. Like creating ""rock is stop"" instead, but I don't see a rock.

Alternatively, create a new rule that negates 'stop'. For example, ""stop is nothing"", but I don't have a 'nothing' rule.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'rule ball' next to 'is' and 'key' to make ""ball is key"", then push the ball over the key. Since the ball would then be a key, and touching it would make me win. Let's see:

The 'rule ball' is at (2,1). The 'key' is at (6,4). The 'is' is at (7,4). So to move the 'rule ball' to (7,4), that's 5 steps right and 3 steps up. But there's a wall at (3,4), so the path is blocked. Alternatively, move the 'rule ball' to the area of 'key' and 'is' by moving right and up. But it's a long distance.

Alternatively, use the existing 'ball' object at (5,3). If I can move that ball next to the key, making it a key. But the ball is an object, not a rule. So to change its property, I need to create a rule like ""ball is key"". To do that, I need the 'ball' rule, which is at (2,1). So moving the 'rule ball' to near 'is' and 'key'.

Assuming the player is at (0,0), the 'rule ball' is at (2,1). The 'key' is at (6,4), 'is' at (7,4). To get there, move right 4, up 3. But there's a wall at (3,4). So maybe go around the wall. From (2,1), move right to (3,1), but there's a wall at (3,1). Can't go there. Move up to (2,2), then right to (3,2) which is a wall. Hmm.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the answer is to move left to get to the 'rule baba' and combine the rules. The 'rule baba' is at (-3,1), 'is' at (-4,2), 'you' at (-3,2). So creating ""baba is you"" is already there. But that's the existing rule. Maybe create ""baba is win"" by moving 'win' next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' is at (8,4). From the player's position (0,0), that's a long way. Not feasible.

Alternatively, the key is at (4,0), blocked by the wall at (3,0). If the player can move the wall, perhaps by changing the 'stop' rule. The 'stop' rule is part of ""wall is stop"". If I can move the 'stop' text block away, then the wall wouldn't be stop. For example, move 'stop' next to 'ball' and 'is' to make ""ball is stop"". But that turns the ball into a stop, which might block other paths.

Alternatively, create a rule ""wall is you"", making the wall something I can move through. To do that, need to create ""wall is you"" by moving 'you' next to 'wall' and 'is'. The 'you' is at (0,-1), 'wall' is at (-1,4), 'is' is at (-2,4). So from (0,-1), move up to (0,0), right to (1,0), up to (1,1), etc., but it's a long path with possible walls.

I'm stuck. Maybe the correct action is to move left towards the 'rule baba' area to try and create a new rule. Since the previous attempts failed, perhaps the","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, basically, I need to get to the key, which is also considered a win condition. But how?

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 5 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up, then more walls moving right and down. Wait, the rule 'ball' is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. Maybe I can use that? But how?

Oh, right! Since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you,"" I can push objects that aren't stopped. The walls are stop, so I can't push them. But maybe the ball can be moved. If I can move the ball out of the way, maybe I can path to the key. Let me check the positions.

The key is at 5 steps right. To get there, I need to go right past the wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps up. But that's a wall. Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step up. So maybe there's a path below? The ball is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move the ball, maybe I can create a path.

But how do I move the ball? I need to be adjacent to it. The rule 'ball' is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So the actual ball is at 5 steps right and 3 step up. Wait, no, the ball object is at 4 steps right and 4 step up? Wait, the objects list shows:

ball 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
wall 2 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 5 step up
rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 5 step up
rule `win` 7 steps to the right and 5 step up

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the positions. Let me parse this again.

The current position of Baba is at 3 step to the left. The rule 'baba' is at 3 step to the left. So I'm at that position. So I need to move from there.

The key is at 5 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, the walls are arranged in a grid. Maybe the path is blocked by walls, but perhaps there's a way around using other objects.

Wait, the rule 'ball' is at 1 step to the right and 2 step up. The actual ball is at 4 steps to the right and 4 step up. So the ball is in a different position. If I can move that ball, maybe I can block a wall or create a path.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules. For example, if I can make 'baba' a 'win' or 'key', then touching the key would be sufficient. But how to do that?

The existing rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So to change the win condition, I need to replace 'key is win' with something else. But to do that, I have to move the 'win' rule text block. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps to the right and 5 step up. But moving that would require me to be able to move it, which I can if it's not a stop. Wait, the rule 'win' is a property of 'key', so maybe the 'win' text block can be moved as long as it's not stopped. But the wall at 3 steps to the right and 4 step up is a stop. So perhaps I can move the 'win' rule to a new position by pushing it over the ball or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like 'baba is win' by combining the 'baba' and 'win' text blocks. But I need to be adjacent to both 'baba' and 'win' rules and move them together. Let me check where those are.

The 'baba' rule is at 3 step to the left. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps to the right and 5 step up. That's quite far. I need to find a way to get between them.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'key' rule to make it a 'win' instead. But the 'key is win' rule is at 6 steps to the right and 5 step up. If I can move that 'is' and 'win' text blocks, perhaps I can change the rule. For example, if I can make 'key' be 'you' instead of 'win', then the win condition would change. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can push objects unless they are stopped. The ball is not a stop, so maybe I can push it. The ball is at 4 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move the ball out of the way, maybe I can path to the key. But how do I get to the ball?

My current position is at rule `baba` which is 3 step to the left. So I'm at position left of the other rules. To get to the ball, I need to move right. Let's see: if I move right once, I'm at 2 steps to the left. Then right again to 1 step to the left. But there's a rule `you` at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Wait, the objects list shows:

rule `baba` 3 step to the left
rule `is` 2 step to the left
rule `you` 1 step to the left

So from my current position (3 steps left), moving right once gets me to 2 steps left, which is the 'is' rule. Then right again to 1 step left, which is the 'you' rule. Then right once more to 0 steps left (center?), but there's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 5 step up. Wait, no, the walls are at different positions.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move down. Let me check the positions again.

The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step up. The ball is at 4 steps right and 4 step up. The wall blocking the path to the key is at 3 steps right and 4 step up. So if I can remove that wall or move it, maybe I can get past.

But walls are 'stop', so I can't push them. The only movable objects are those not defined as stop. The ball is not a stop, so maybe I can push it. If I can push the ball into the wall, perhaps the wall is no longer in the way. But how?

The ball is at 4 steps right and 4 step up. To move it down to 4 steps right and 3 step up, which is where the wall is at 3 steps right and 3 step up? Wait, no. The wall at 3 steps right and 4 step up is adjacent to the ball's position. If I push the ball down, it would move to 4 steps right and 3 step up, which might move it away from the wall. But then the wall is still there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the 'rule ball' at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can change the property of ball. For example, if I make 'ball is stop', then the ball would block my path. But that doesn't help. Or if I make 'ball is you', then I could become a ball and move through walls. But that requires creating a new rule.

To create a new rule, I need to have the 'ball' text block, the 'is' text block, and the 'you' text block in adjacent positions. Let me see where those are.

The 'ball' rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. The 'is' rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up, and also at 1 step left and 1 step down. The 'you' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So maybe I can move the 'ball' rule to be near an 'is' and 'you' to create 'ball is you'.

But how to get there. Current position is 3 steps left. Need to move right multiple times. Let's see:

From 3 left, move right to 2 left (is), then right to 1 left (you), then right to 0, then right to 1, 2, 3, etc. But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 3 steps right and 4 step up is a wall. Wait, maybe I need to go down instead.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'win' rule to change the win condition. The 'win' rule is at 7 steps right and 5 step up. If I can move that down to where the key is, then touching the key would be win. But the key is at 5 steps right, and the 'win' rule is at 7 right and 5 up. So moving the 'win' rule left two steps and down four steps would place it at 5 right and 1 up, matching the key's position. But that requires pushing the 'win' rule through obstacles.

But the 'win' rule is a text block, so I need to be adjacent to it and move it. However, the path from 7 right,5 up to 5 right,1 up is blocked by walls and other rules. For example, between 7 right and 5 right, there's a wall at 6 steps right and 5 step up (part of the key's rule setup). So moving the 'win' rule left would hit that wall.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: since I'm Baba and 'baba is you', I can move freely unless blocked by stop. The key is win, so if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls. The ball might be a way to push walls aside, but walls are stop, so can't be pushed. Unless the ball is used to change the wall's property.

Wait, if I can make 'wall is not stop', then I could push walls. But to do that, I need to change the existing rule 'wall is stop'. To do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule away or replace it.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule, then the wall's property would change. For example, if I move 'stop' to 'ball is stop', then walls would no longer be stop. But that requires creating a new rule.

Alternatively, delete the 'wall is stop' rule. But how? By moving the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 3 left and 5 up. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 4 up. If I can move the 'stop' rule, say, to the right, then the 'wall is stop' rule would be broken. But the 'stop' rule is a separate text block. Let me check if I can move it.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. My current position is 3 steps left. So from 3 left, I need to move left to 2 left (which is the 'is' rule), then left to 1 left (the 'you' rule), then left again? But there's no rule beyond that. Wait, the 'stop' rule is at 1 left and 4 up. So to get to it, I need to move left from my current position (3 left) to 2 left, then 1 left, then maybe up to 4 up? But that's a long way.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the 'stop' rule by being adjacent to it and moving in a direction that pushes it. Since the 'stop' rule is a text block, and unless it's defined as stop, I can move it. But 'stop' is a property of wall, not of the 'stop' rule itself. So as long as I'm not pushing against a stop, I can move the 'stop' rule.

So, from my current position (3 left), I need to move left to reach the 'stop' rule at 1 left and 4 up. Let's see the path:

Current position: 3 left.

Move left 1 step to 2 left (is rule).

Move left another step to 1 left (you rule).

Now at 1 left. From here, need to move up 3 steps to reach 4 up (where stop is). But the way up might be blocked. Looking at the map, at 1 left and 4 up, there's the 'stop' rule. Above that, at 1 left and 5 up, there's nothing mentioned, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 5 up. Wait, not sure.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think again: the key is at 5 right, 1 up. The ball is at 4 right,4 up. If I can move the ball down towards the key, maybe I can create a path. But the ball is not a stop, so I can push it. To push the ball, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it.

The ball is at 4 right,4 up. To push it down, I need to be to its left, right, up, or down. Let's see:

If I'm at 3 left (current position), moving right to 2 left (is), then right to 1 left (you), then right to 0, right to 1, 2, 3, 4 right. But along the way, there's a wall at 3 right and 4 up. So maybe I need to go around.

Alternatively, move down from the current position. My current position is rule 'baba' at 3 left. If I move down, where am I? The observation doesn't specify the exact grid, but assuming that moving down from 3 left would take me to 3 left and 1 down, etc. But there's a wall at 2 right and 1 down. Hmm.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the solution is to move the 'win' rule to the key's position. The 'win' rule is at 7 right,5 up. To get there, I need to move left and down. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 6 right,5 up is the 'is' rule, and at 5 right,5 up is the 'key' rule. So moving left from 7 right,5 up would hit those rules.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'key is you', making the key a you, so touching it would make me you and win. But to do that, I need 'key', 'is', and 'you' text blocks in adjacent positions.

The 'key' rule is at 6 right,5 up. The 'is' rule is at 7 right,5 up (next to 'key'), and the 'you' rule is at 1 left,1 down. So it's impossible to get 'you' near 'key' and 'is' because they're on the opposite side of the map.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: since the ball has a rule 'rule ball' at 2 right,1 up. If I can make 'ball is win', then touching the ball would make me win. But how?

To create 'ball is win', I need to have 'ball', 'is', and 'win' text blocks adjacent. The 'ball' rule is at 2 right,1 up. The 'win' rule is at 7 right,5 up. The 'is' rule is at 1 left,4 up and 7 right,5 up. So it's a long way. Maybe not feasible.

Wait, the 'is' rule is also at 6 right,5 up (next to 'key'). So if I can move the 'win' rule to be near 'ball' and 'is', that could work. But again, the path is blocked.

Alternatively, use the existing 'ball' rule. The actual ball is at 4 right,4 up. If I can push it into the key's position, but the key is at 5 right,1 up. That doesn't seem possible.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try moving in a specific direction. Let's look at the last few actions. The user tried left, up, left, etc., but the system kept failing. Maybe the correct action is to move right towards the key, but avoiding walls. Let's check the path from current position (3 left) to 5 right,1 up.

The path would be: move right three times (to 0, 1, 2, 3 right), then down four times (to 1 up). But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 3 right,4 up is a wall. So if I go right to 3 right, then down, but the wall is at 3 right,4 up. So I can't go through there.

Alternatively, move down first. From 3 left, move down to avoid walls. But not sure.

Wait, the key is at 5 right,1 up. The ball is at 4 right,4 up. If I can move the ball down to 4 right,3 up, which is where the wall is at 3 right,3 up. That might not help.

Another idea: since 'baba is you', maybe I can push the key if it's not stopped. But the key's rule is 'key is win', so it's not defined as stop. Wait, the 'key is win' rule doesn't make the key a stop, so maybe I can push the key. If I can move the key to the 'win' position, but the 'win' is already at 7 right,5 up.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'baba is win' by combining the 'baba' and 'win' text blocks. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, and the 'win' rule is at 7 right,5 up. That's a far distance, but maybe possible by moving through the map.

But how to get there. It would take many moves, and the system might not allow that. Given the previous failed actions, maybe the intended solution is to move right towards the key, avoiding the walls by using the ball to move obstacles. But I'm not seeing the exact path.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move down","

86,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move around unless there's a wall. The goal is to get the key, which is set as win, but I need to reach it.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule 'ball' 1 step to the right and 1 step up. The ball is a grounded object, and since there's a rule 'rule ball', maybe I can manipulate that. The key is at 5 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 2 steps right and 4 up, then 3 steps right and so on. So the path to the key is blocked by walls which are stop, meaning I can't go through them.

Wait, maybe I can change the rules. If I can move the 'ball' rule to create a new rule, perhaps making the ball a stop or something else. Or maybe change 'win' to something else. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. If I can make the key not a win, then maybe the win is elsewhere, like Baba itself. But how?

Alternatively, if I can push the ball onto the key, but the ball's rule is at 1 step right and 1 up. Maybe I can move that rule to combine with 'key' and 'is' to form a new rule. For example, if I move the 'ball' rule next to 'key' and 'is', I could make 'key' be 'ball' or something. But I need to know where those objects are located.

Looking at the positions: the rule 'key' is at 6 steps right and 4 up. Rule 'is' is at 7 right and 4 up. So if I can move the 'ball' rule (which is at 2 right, 1 up) to be next to 'key' and 'is', then I could change 'key is win' to 'ball is win'. But I have to move the 'ball' rule there. But can I move it? The rule 'ball' is a text block, so if it's not defined as stop, I can move it. The current active rules don't make rules stop, only walls are stop. So the 'ball' rule can be moved.

So the plan would be: move the 'ball' rule to be next to 'key' and 'is', changing the rule to 'key is ball' or 'ball is win'. Wait, the existing rule is 'key is win'. If I can replace 'win' with 'ball', then the key would be win if ball is win. Maybe not. Alternatively, create a new rule 'ball is win', which would make the ball the win condition. Then, if I can reach the ball, I win.

But the ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up. There's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 up, so I can't go directly right. Maybe I need to push the wall aside? But walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless I change their rule. But 'wall is stop' is a rule, so if I can delete that rule or change it, then walls wouldn't be stop. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall' rule (which is at 2 left, 4 up) to somewhere else. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba, and 'baba is you', maybe I can move the 'wall is stop' rule out of the way. If I can move that rule, then walls wouldn't be stop, and I could walk through them. But the 'wall' rule is at 2 left and 4 up. To get there, I need to move left and up, but there might be obstacles. Let me check the map again.

Current position of Baba: the 'rule baba' is at 2 left and 1 down. So I'm at 2 left, 1 down. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 4 up. To get there, I need to move up 3 steps and stay left 2. But the path might be blocked. Let's see the objects around me.

Looking at the objects: to the right, there are walls at 3 steps right and various up positions. To the left, there's the rule 'baba', 'is', 'you' at 3 left, then 2 left, then 1 left. So moving left from my current position (2 left, 1 down) would take me to 1 left, 1 down, which has the 'you' rule. Then to the left again to 0 left, 1 down, but I don't see any wall there. So maybe I can move left twice to reach the 'wall is stop' rule's position.

Wait, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 step to the left and 4 step up. So from my current position (rule baba is at 2 left, 1 down), I need to move left 0 steps (since it's already 2 left) and up 4 steps. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the vertical path.

From my position (2 left, 1 down), moving up step by step:

1 up: there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 up. But I'm on the left side. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the key is to manipulate the rules by moving them to create new rules that allow passage.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, and it's at 5 right, maybe I can push the key to Baba's position. But the key is an object; can I push it? The rules don't say anything about pushing, but in Baba Is You, you can move objects that are not stop. Since the key's rule is 'key is win', and it's a grounded key, maybe it's movable unless there's a stop rule. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba a win. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then wherever I am, I win. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 4 up. The 'is' rule next to it is at 7 right, 4 up. So if I can move the 'win' rule to 6 right, 4 up (next to 'key is'), but that's where the 'key' rule is. Hmm.

Alternatively, move the 'win' rule to be adjacent to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. So moving the 'win' rule there would require a lot of steps. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the ball can be used. If I can make the ball a win, then grabbing the ball would make me win. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 3 right, 3 up, so I can't go right past that. Unless I can move the wall rule. But the wall rule is at 2 left, 4 up. To get there, I need to move left and up, but from my current position (2 left, 1 down), moving left would take me to 1 left, 1 down, which has the 'you' rule. Then up to 1 left, 4 up: but what's there? The 'wall' rule is at 2 left, 4 up. So maybe I need to move right first?

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline steps:

1. Identify movable objects: The rules for 'wall', 'is', 'stop', 'key', 'win', 'ball', 'baba' are all text blocks. Since 'wall is stop', but 'is', 'key', 'win', 'ball', 'baba' are not stop, they can be moved.

2. Goal: Reach the key (which is win) or change the win condition to something reachable.

3. Obstacles: Walls are stop, blocking the path to the key.

Possible solutions:

- Remove the 'wall is stop' rule by moving it away, making walls passable.

- Change the 'key is win' rule to something else, like 'ball is win', then go get the ball.

- Make Baba the win by creating 'baba is win'.

Let's focus on the first option: removing 'wall is stop'.

The 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 4 up. To move it, I need to navigate there. From my current position (2 left, 1 down), I need to move up 3 steps and stay at 2 left. Let's see if the path is clear.

From (2 left, 1 down):

- Up 1 step: position (2 left, 2 down). Is there anything there? Looking at objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up, but that's on the right side. On the left, maybe open.

- Up 2 steps: (2 left, 3 down). Similarly, check objects. At 3 steps right and 3 up, there's a wall. But again, that's on the right. On the left, perhaps clear.

- Up 3 steps: (2 left, 4 down). Now, at 2 left, 4 up (since direction might be inverted). Wait, the coordinate system might be relative to Baba's position. This is a bit unclear, but assuming that moving up increases the 'up' coordinate.

Assuming that the path from (2 left, 1 down) to (2 left, 4 up) is clear, I can move up three times. But need to confirm if there are any stop objects in between.

Looking at the objects, the walls are at various positions, but none specifically blocking the upward path from my current position to the 'wall is stop' rule. So maybe I can move up three times to reach the 'wall is stop' rule, then move it away.

Once I move the 'wall is stop' rule, walls won't be stop anymore, allowing me to walk through them. Then I can path through the walls to the key.

Alternatively, if I can't move the 'wall is stop' rule directly, maybe I can move adjacent rules to create a new rule that deletes 'wall is stop'.

Another approach: Use the 'ball' rule. If I can move the 'ball' rule next to 'win' and 'is', creating 'ball is win', then the ball becomes the win condition. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to navigate around the walls. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 right, various ups. If walls are stop, I can't pass. So unless I remove the 'wall is stop' rule, this is tricky.

So the most promising path is to remove the 'wall is stop' rule. Let's try to do that.

Moving from current position (rule baba at 2 left, 1 down):

1. Move up once to reach 2 left, 2 down.

2. Move up again to 2 left, 3 down.

3. Move up again to 2 left, 4 down (which is 4 up from the original position? Maybe the coordinates are relative. This is a bit confusing, but assuming that each 'up' increases the up coordinate.

At 2 left, 4 up, there's the 'wall is stop' rule. Now, I need to move this rule. To do that, I can move it to an adjacent tile. For example, move it one step to the right (3 left, 4 up), which might be possible if there's no stop there.

Once moved, the 'wall is stop' rule is no longer in place, so walls are no longer stop. Then I can walk through the walls.

After removing 'wall is stop', I can go towards the key at 5 right, 4 up. But there are walls at 3 right, 4 up, etc. Since walls are no longer stop, I can move through them. So path would be: right, right, right, up, etc., but need to navigate around.

Alternatively, after removing 'wall is stop', go to the key directly.

So the steps would be:

- Move up three times to reach the 'wall is stop' rule.

- Move the 'wall is stop' rule to a different location, say, one step to the right.

- Now, walls are not stop, so I can walk through them.

- Navigate to the key at 5 right, 4 up.

But how to execute this in the game?

First, from the initial position (rule baba at 2 left, 1 down):

Action sequence:

1. up (to 2 left, 2 down)

2. up (to 2 left, 3 down)

3. up (to 2 left, 4 down) - now at the 'wall is stop' rule.

4. move the 'wall is stop' rule to the right. Since it's a text block, I can push it one step right. So action 'right' while holding the 'wall is stop' rule.

But wait, in Baba Is You, you have to physically move the text blocks by moving towards them and then in the direction you want to push them. So to move the 'wall is stop' rule to the right, I need to be adjacent to it and then move right.

So after reaching 2 left, 4 down (where the 'wall is stop' rule is), I need to move right to push it. But since I'm Baba, and the rule is 'baba is you', I can move. So action: right. This would push the 'wall is stop' rule one step to the right.

Now, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 3 left, 4 up. The original wall objects are still there, but the rule that makes them stop has been moved, so they are just walls but not stop. So I can walk through them.

Then, from my current position (2 left, 4 down), which is now next to the moved 'wall is stop' rule, I need to proceed to the key.

The key is at 5 right, 4 up. From my current position (2 left, 4 down), I need to move right multiple times and up.

But directions are relative. Assuming that 'right' increases the right coordinate, 'up' increases the up coordinate.

So from 2 left, 4 down:

- Move right four times to get to 6 left (wait, no, left and right are opposites). Maybe I'm getting confused with the coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps the map is laid out with Baba starting at a certain point, and objects have absolute positions. But without a visual, it's hard to say. But given the observation data, the objects have positions relative to Baba.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the safest move is to try to move the 'ball' rule to create a new win condition.

The 'ball' rule is at 2 right, 1 up. The 'key' is at 6 right, 4 up. The 'is' rule next to 'key' is at 7 right, 4 up. So if I can move the 'ball' rule to 6 right, 4 up, adjacent to 'key' and 'is', then the rule would be 'key is ball', making the key a ball. But the goal is still to get the key, which is now a ball. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, move 'ball' rule to be next to 'win' and 'is', creating 'ball is win'. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 4 up. 'is' is at 7 right, 4 up. So moving 'ball' from 2 right, 1 up to 7 right, 4 up would require a lot of steps. Not feasible.

Another idea: Make Baba the win. To do that, create 'baba is win'. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 4 up. The 'is' rule is between them. So need to move 'baba' rule next to 'win' and 'is'. But that's a long distance.

Alternatively, use existing rules. The current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If I can change 'key is win' to 'baba is win', then touching Baba would make you win. Since I'm Baba, that would work. To do that, I need to move the 'win' rule to be adjacent to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 4 up. The 'is' rule next to it is at 7 right, 4 up. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 1 down. So I need to move the 'win' rule all the way to the left. That seems impossible without removing obstacles.

Hmm. Maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is at 5 right, 4 up, and there's a ball at 5 right, 3 up, maybe I can push the ball onto the key. But the ball is a separate object. If I can move the ball to the key's position, then maybe the key becomes a ball, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, use the ball's rule. The 'rule ball' is at 2 right, 1 up. If I can move that rule to modify another rule. For example, move it next to 'key' and 'is' to make 'key is ball', but then the key is a ball, which might not help.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'wall is stop' rule out of the way, allowing passage through walls, then go straight to the key.

So step-by-step:

1. From current position (rule baba at 2 left, 1 down), move up three times to reach the 'wall is stop' rule at 2 left, 4 up.

2. Move the 'wall is stop' rule one step to the right, making it 3 left, 4 up.

3. Now, walls are not stop, so I can walk through them.

4. Move right four times to reach x=6 (assuming right increases the x-coordinate), then up to reach the key.

But how to translate this into actions?

Each move is a single step. Let's map it out:

Current position after step 1 (reaching 'wall is stop'):

Assuming each 'up' from 1 down to 4 down places me at 2 left, 4 up.

Then, action 'right' to move the 'wall is stop' rule to 3 left, 4 up.

Now, walls are not stop. Then, from my current position (which is now","

Let me try to figure out this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is currently a key. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move around unless there's a wall, which stops me. The key is marked as win, so if I can get to it, I win.

Looking at the map, the key is at 5 steps to the right. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up blocking that path. Wait, are the walls stopping me? Since wall is stop, I can't go through them. So I need a way to remove the wall or make it not a stop.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up"". The ball has a rule attached to it. Maybe I can move that rule somewhere else. If I can change the ball's rule, maybe I can make it stop or win. But how?

The rule ""ball is stop"" is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule away, maybe the ball isn't a stop anymore. But to move a rule, I need to be next to it and not be stopped. Let's see where I am. The current position of Baba is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down. So Baba is at that position. To move, I can go left, right, up, or down.

Wait, the rule ""baba is you"" is at 3 steps to the left. So maybe I'm next to that? Or maybe I need to move to that rule to manipulate it. If I can make myself a different object, like WIN, then touching the key would win. To do that, I need to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key"", that might work.

But the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So to change that, I need to either move the existing rules or create new ones. Let's look at the objects again. There's a rule `you` at 1 step down. If I can move that rule to connect with Baba, maybe I can make Baba have a different property.

Alternatively, the rule `ball` is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule next to the key, maybe changing the key's property. But the key is already defined as win. Hmm.

Wait, the rule ""key is win"" is at 6 steps to the right and 4 step up. If I can remove that rule or replace it, maybe the key becomes something else. But how? To remove a rule, I need to move it off the grid, perhaps by pushing it into a stop? But walls are stop. Or maybe there's a way to delete it by overwriting it with another rule.

Alternatively, if I can make ""key is not win"", but that's not a valid rule format. The rules are in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So maybe if I create a new rule that says ""key is stop"", then key would be both win and stop, which might not be allowed. But I'm not sure how the game handles conflicting rules.

Another angle: the ball has a rule ""ball is stop"" at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule to the key, making ""key is stop"", then the key would be a stop, but it's also defined as win. Maybe that's possible. But how to move the rule?

To move a rule, I have to be next to it and it shouldn't be stopped. The rule `ball` is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can get to that position, I can move the rule. But where is Baba currently? The rule `baba` is at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So Baba is positioned such that moving right might get closer to the ball's rule.

Wait, the current position of Baba's rule is 3 steps to the left. So if I move right, each step brings me closer. Let's see: the rule `baba` is 3 steps left. So from there, moving right once would be 2 steps left, then again to 1 step left, etc. But the active rules include ""baba is you"", so moving around should be possible as long I'm not hitting a stop.

Looking at the map, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. So if I try to move right from my current position, I need to check if there's a wall blocking. The walls are at various positions, but the key is at 5 steps to the right. Maybe the path is blocked by walls, but perhaps there's a way around using the rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a wall. But the rule says wall is stop, so I can't push it unless it's not a stop. But how? If I can change the wall's property, but that requires manipulating the rules.

Another thought: if I can make the ball a you, then touching the ball would make me a you, but I'm already a you. Wait, no, the active rule is ""baba is you"", so I am you. If I can make the ball also you, then maybe I can move it. But the ball is currently stopped by the rule ""ball is stop"".

So the plan is: move the ""ball is stop"" rule away so the ball isn't stopped anymore, then move the ball to block a wall or create a path. But how does that help reach the key?

Alternatively, use the ball to push a wall. If the ball isn't stopped, maybe I can push a wall by moving into it, but walls are stop. Wait, if I can make a wall not a stop, then I can push it. But to do that, I need to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 5 steps up. To move that rule, I need to be next to it. But my current position is rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 1 step down. That's quite far from the wall's rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, ""baba is stop"", but then I would be a stop and couldn't move. Not helpful.

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move unless there's a wall. The key is at 5 steps right, but blocked by a wall at 3 steps right. So how to get past the wall?

Maybe push the wall by moving into it, but since it's a stop, I can't. Unless I can change the wall's property. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can push it. To do that, I need to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule or replace it.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 steps left and 5 steps up. To move that rule, I need to be next to it. Let's see my current position: rule `baba` is at 3 steps left and 1 step down. So to get to the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move up 4 steps and left 2 steps. But there are walls along the way. For example, at 2 steps right and 4 step up there's a wall. So moving up might be blocked.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach. The rule ""key is win"" is at 6 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that rule to be next to the key, but the key is already there. Maybe changing the key's property, but it's already win.

Alternatively, make Baba a win. So create a rule ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule from the key to Baba. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move that rule to where Baba is, then ""baba is win"" would make touching anything win, or just being Baba would win. Not sure.

But how to move the ""win"" rule. The current position of the ""win"" rule is 7 steps right and 4 step up. The key is at 5 steps right. So if I can move the ""win"" rule left to the key's position, then the key would be win (which it already is), but maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, move it to Baba's position.

But to move the ""win"" rule, I need to be next to it. The ""win"" rule is far to the right. My current position is rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path.

Wait, looking at the map again:

- There's a wall at 2 steps right and 4 step up.
- Then a ball at 4 steps right and 3 step up.
- Another wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up.
- A rule `ball` at 2 steps right and 1 step up.
- Walls continuing down.

So moving right from my current position (2 left, 1 down) would require passing through these walls. Unless there's a way to make a wall not a stop.

Alternatively, use the ball to move a wall. If the ball isn't stopped, maybe it can push a wall. But the ball is stopped by ""ball is stop"". So first, need to remove that rule.

The ""ball is stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule away, the ball becomes movable. Then, maybe push a wall with the ball.

To move the ""ball is stop"" rule, I need to be next to it. From my current position (rule `baba` at 2 left, 1 down), moving right twice would get me to the ball's rule's position (2 right, 1 up). Wait, the ball's rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So if I move right twice from my current position (which is 2 left, 1 down), I would end up at 0 steps left, 1 down. But need to check if the path is clear.

Wait, moving right from 2 left to 1 left, then to 0 left (which is center), then to 1 right. But between here and the ball's rule, are there any walls? Let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down.

Moving right once: 1 step left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, the walls are at 2 right, 4 up; 3 right, 4 up; 3 right, 3 up; etc. Downwards, there's a wall at 3 right, 1 down. So moving right from 2 left to 1 left, 1 down—probably no wall there. Then moving right again to 0 left, 1 down. Still no wall. Then up to 2 right, 1 up. That's where the ""ball is stop"" rule is. So if I can move there, I can grab that rule.

But wait, the rule `ball` is at 2 right, 1 up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it. So from my current position (2 left, 1 down), moving right three times would get me to 2 right, 1 down. Then moving up once to reach 2 right, 1 up, which is the rule's position. Once there, I can pick up the rule and move it.

If I move the ""ball is stop"" rule to another location, say next to the key, then the ball wouldn't be a stop anymore. Then I could push the ball into a wall to create a path. Or maybe use the ball to block a wall's movement.

Alternatively, move the ""ball is stop"" rule to the ""wall is stop"" rule, replacing it. But not sure if that helps.

Once the ball is no longer stopped, maybe I can push it against a wall to create a new wall that's in a different position, opening a path. For example, push the ball from 2 right, 1 up to 3 right, 1 up, which is a wall. But since the ball is no longer stopped, maybe it can move into the wall, which is a stop. Wait, but walls are stops, so the ball can't move into them. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the movable ball to push another object. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: since the key is defined as win, if I can make myself a win, then just touching anything would win. To make ""baba is win"", I need to create that rule. The current rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". So if I can remove ""key is win"" and add ""baba is win"", that would work. But how?

To remove ""key is win"", I need to move that rule off the grid. The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 right, 4 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. That's quite far from my current position. So maybe this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by placing the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"". The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 2 right, 4 up is a wall. So moving right from my current position (2 left, 1 down) to reach 7 right would require passing through walls at 3 right, 4 up; 3 right, 3 up; etc. Unless there's a way to make those walls not stops.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the solution is to move the ""ball is stop"" rule away, making the ball movable, then push it into a position that helps bypass the wall blocking the key.

For example, if I move the ""ball is stop"" rule to the left, then the ball at 5 right, 3 up can be moved. If I push the ball from its current position (5 right, 3 up) to 4 right, 3 up, which is empty, then maybe create a path. But how does that help with the wall at 3 right, 4 up?

Alternatively, use the ball to block the wall's movement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the wall at 3 right, 4 up is blocking the key's path. If I can move that wall, maybe by pushing it with the ball, but the wall is a stop. Unless the ball is not a stop anymore.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the ""ball is stop"" rule away to make the ball movable.
2. Move the ball to push the wall at 3 right, 4 up, possibly moving it out of the way.
3. Then go straight to the key at 5 right.

But how to execute step 1 and 2.

First, to move the ""ball is stop"" rule. From my current position (2 left, 1 down), I need to move right three times to get to 2 right, 1 up (the rule's position). Then move the rule, say to 2 right, 2 up. Now the ball at 5 right, 3 up is no longer stopped. Then, move the ball from 5 right, 3 up to 4 right, 3 up, then to 3 right, 3 up, etc., pushing the wall at 3 right, 4 up down? Not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, push the ball into the wall at 3 right, 4 up. But since the ball is now movable and the wall is a stop, can the ball push the wall? Probably not, because walls are stops. The ball can't move into a stop, so pushing the wall would require the ball to move into the wall's space, which is blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think about the active rules again. The key is win, so if I can reach the key, I win. The problem is the wall blocking the path. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can walk through it. To do that, remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 5 up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it. My current position is 2 left, 1 down. That's a long way up and left. There are walls along the way, like at 2 right, 4 up. So moving up from 2 left, 1 down would require passing through those walls, which I can't do because they're stops.

Alternatively, use the ball to move the ""wall is stop"" rule. But the ball is stopped unless its rule is removed. So first, remove the ball's stop rule, then use the ball to push the wall's rule.

But this seems too convoluted. Maybe there's a different rule manipulation. What if I create a new rule that says ""baba is win""? Then, even without reaching the key, touching anything would make me win. To create that rule, I need to have the ""win"" rule next to ""baba"".

The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 4 up. The ""baba"" rule is at 2 left, 1 down. So I need to move the ""win"" rule to be adjacent to the ""baba"" rule. But that's a long distance. However, maybe there's a way to move the ""win"" rule step by step.

Alternatively, use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can move the ""win"" part to Baba, making ""baba is win"". But the ""win"" rule is separate. So maybe I can detach ""win"" from key and attach it to Baba.

The way rules work is that each rule is a triplet: [Subject] IS [Property]. So ""key IS win"" means key has the property win. To make Baba have win, I need ""baba IS win"".

To do that, I can move the ""win"" rule from the key to Baba. But how? The ""win"" rule is part of the ""key IS win"" rule. So if I can break that rule into its components and create a new one.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can move individual text blocks that make up a rule. For example, if a rule is ""key IS win"", you can move the ""key"" text block, the ""IS"" text block, or the ""win"" text block separately. So maybe I can take the ""win"" text","

Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba because ""baba is you"" means I can move. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The key is win, but I need to get there. The ball is being influenced by the rule ""rule ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up."" Maybe that means the ball is moving on its own? Or maybe that's a static rule?

Looking at the objects, the key is at 5 steps to the right. But there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up, which is probably blocking the direct path. The ball is at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, which is below the key. Maybe I need to move the ball somehow? But how?

Wait, the rule ""rule ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up"" might mean that the ball has a property that makes it move. But since I'm Baba, maybe I can push it if I'm not stopped. But walls are stop, so if I try to push the ball into a wall, I can't. Let me check the positions again.

The key is at 5 steps right. The wall blocking the path is at 3 steps right and 4 steps up. So from my current position (which I need to figure out), maybe I can move left to get around the wall? But how do I know where I am? The observation mentions objects relative to the player, but the exact position isn't given. Wait, the rules and objects are listed with their positions relative to the player. For example, ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down"" probably means the Baba rule is 3 steps left and down from me. So maybe I'm positioned somewhere relative to these objects.

If the key is 5 steps to the right, and there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps up, maybe the path is blocked. To reach the key, I need to go around the wall. But how? If I can move right, but the wall is at 3 steps right and 4 up, perhaps moving down? Or maybe manipulating the rules.

The rule ""rule ball..."" is nearby. Maybe if I can change the ball's rule to make it a win instead of a stop? But how? To do that, I need to move the ""ball"" text block and ""is"" and ""win"" together to create ""ball is win"". But the current active rule is ""key is win"", so changing that would require removing or altering it.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", maybe I can move the ""baba"" text block to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I would become the win condition. But that requires moving the necessary text blocks.

Looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is 2 steps left and 1 step down. The ""is"" is 1 step left and 1 step down, and ""you"" is 1 step down. So if I can move those to form ""baba is win"", that would work. The ""win"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up, which is far away. Maybe I need to move the ""win"" text block closer.

But moving text blocks requires that they are not stopped. The wall is a stop, so I need to avoid those areas. The key is at 5 steps right, and there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. Maybe I can move right towards the key, but the wall is blocking the upper path. Alternatively, move down to avoid the wall.

Wait, the current position of the player (Baba) isn't explicitly stated, but based on the rules, like ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 1 step down"", that suggests the player is somewhere in the grid. Let's try to sketch a rough map.

Assuming the player is at position (0,0):

- rule `baba` is at (-3, -1)
- rule `is` is at (-2, -1)
- rule `you` is at (0, -1)
- wall at (3,4)
- key at (5,0)
- ball at (5,3)
- rule `ball` is at (2,1)
- other walls are positioned accordingly.

So the player is likely near the bottom-left area. To get to the key at (5,0), need to go right. The path directly right is blocked by a wall at (3,4), but that's higher up. Maybe moving down towards the key.

But the ball is at (5,3), which is above the key. Maybe moving the ball down? But how? The rule ""rule ball 2 steps right and 1 step up"" might mean the ball is moving up, but since it's a static rule, maybe it's just a text block that's placed there.

Alternatively, if I can push the ball into the key's position. But the key is at (5,0), and the ball is at (5,3). The ball is moving up according to its rule, but if I can move the ball down, maybe by overlapping it with another object? Not sure.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I just need to reach it. But the path is blocked. Maybe using the ball to break the wall? If the ball is a stop, but currently the rule is ""wall is stop"", so the ball's rule is separate. If I can change the ball's rule to not be stop, perhaps I can push it into the wall and destroy it? But I don't know if that's possible.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not stopped. So if the ball is not a stop, I can push it. But right now, the ball's rule is ""rule ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up"", which might be a dynamic rule making it move, but it doesn't necessarily make it stop. So maybe I can push the ball.

But how do I get to the ball? The player is at (0,0), ball is at (5,3). There are walls blocking the way. Maybe move right step by step, avoiding walls. Let's see:

From (0,0), moving right to (1,0). Then right to (2,0). Then right to (3,0). But there's a wall at (3,1). So can't go there. Maybe move up to (3,1) but it's a wall. Alternatively, move down to (3,-1), but there's a wall there as well (from the observation: wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down). So (3,-1) is a wall.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe need to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""key is you"", then the key would become the player, and I can move it. But to do that, I need to move the ""key"" text block with ""is"" and ""you"".

The ""key"" rule is at (6,4), ""is"" is at (7,4), and ""win"" is at (8,4). So if I can move these three to form ""key is you"", that would change the key's property. But moving them requires avoiding the walls.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", maybe I can create a new rule ""baba is win"" to make myself the win condition. The ""baba"" rule is at (-3,-1), ""is"" at (-2,-1), and ""you"" at (0,-1). If I can move these to form ""baba is win"", but where is the ""win"" rule? It's at (8,4), which is far away. Moving all those text blocks would take multiple steps, and I need to navigate around walls.

This seems complex. Maybe a simpler approach: move towards the key, finding a path. Let's see the map again.

The key is at (5,0). The player is at (0,0). The path to (5,0) is blocked by walls at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0)? Wait, no. From the observation:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up: (3,4)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up: (3,3)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up: (3,2)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up: (3,1)
- wall 3 steps to the right: (3,0)

So the vertical line x=3 from y=0 to y=4 are all walls. Therefore, the direct path to the key at (5,0) is blocked on the x=3 column. So I need to go around either left or right around the walls.

But x=3 is a solid wall from y=0 to y=4. To get to x=5, y=0, I need to go around either above or below the wall. But above the wall at x=3, y=4 is open, but how to get there without hitting walls.

Alternatively, go down from x=3, but y=0 is the key. Maybe move right past the wall. Wait, the walls at x=3 are from y=0 to y=4. So to go around, I need to move left from x=3, but the player is at x=0, so moving right towards x=3 is blocked.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's try to map it out step by step.

Player's position: Let's assume the player is at (0,0).

- rule `baba` is 3 steps left and 1 step down: so (-3, -1)
- rule `is` is 2 steps left and 1 step down: (-2, -1)
- rule `you` is 1 step down: (0, -1)
- wall at 3 steps right and 4 up: (3,4)
- wall at 3 right, 3 up: (3,3)
- wall at 3 right, 2 up: (3,2)
- wall at 3 right, 1 up: (3,1)
- wall at 3 right: (3,0)
- key at 5 right: (5,0)
- ball at 5 right, 3 up: (5,3)
- rule `ball` at 2 right, 1 up: (2,1)

So the walls form a vertical line at x=3 from y=0 to y=4. The key is at (5,0), which is two steps to the right from x=3. But the path from x=0 to x=5 is blocked by the walls at x=3. Therefore, to reach the key, I need to go around the walls either above or below.

Going above: From (0,0), move up towards y=4, but there's a wall at (3,4). So need to go around that. But how?

Alternatively, move down from (0,0) to (0,-1), but there's a rule `you` there, not a wall. Wait, the walls are at specific positions. The player is at (0,0). Moving down to (0,-1) is allowed unless there's a wall. From the observation, the walls are at (3,0), (3,1), etc. So (0,-1) is clear.

So possible path:

(0,0) → right to (1,0) → right to (2,0) → right to (3,0) is a wall. Can't go there. So need to move up from (2,0) to (2,1). Is there a wall there? The observation lists a wall at (3,1), but not at (2,1). There's a rule `ball` at (2,1), which is a text block, not a wall. So (2,1) is clear.

So path:

(0,0) → right → (1,0) → right → (2,0) → up → (2,1) → right → (3,1) is a wall. Can't go there. So from (2,1), move right to (3,1) blocked. Instead, move up to (2,2). Is there a wall? The walls are at (3,2), so (2,2) is clear.

From (2,2), move right to (3,2) which is a wall. So move up to (2,3). Check for walls: (3,3) is a wall. So (2,3) is clear. Move right to (3,3) blocked. Move up to (2,4). Is there a wall? (3,4) is a wall, but (2,4) is clear.

From (2,4), move right to (3,4) which is a wall. Can't. So this path doesn't work.

Alternative path: From (0,0), move down to (0,-1) → right to (1,-1) → right to (2,-1) → up to (2,0) → right to (3,0) wall. No good.

Hmm. Maybe need to go around the wall from the left side. But the wall starts at x=3, so the left side is clear. Wait, the walls are only at x=3 from y=0 to y=4. So to the left of x=3, it's open. So maybe go around the wall from the left.

From (0,0) → up to (0,1) → right to (1,1) → right to (2,1) → up to (2,2) → right to (3,2) wall. Blocked. This isn't working.

Alternatively, go all the way up around the wall. From (0,0) → up to (0,1) → up to (0,2) → up to (0,3) → up to (0,4). Then right to (1,4) → right to (2,4) → right to (3,4) wall. No.

This seems really blocked. Maybe the intended solution is to change the rules. For example, make the key not a win, or make Baba a win.

Since ""key is win"" is active, but if I can change that to ""key is stop"", then the key wouldn't be a win, but I still need to reach it. Or make ""baba is win"".

To make ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""win"" together. The ""baba"" rule is at (-3,-1), ""is"" at (-2,-1), and ""win"" is at (8,4). That's a long distance. Maybe move step by step.

But how to move those text blocks? The player is at (0,0). To reach (-3,-1), need to move left. From (0,0) → left to (-1,0) → left to (-2,0) → left to (-3,0) → down to (-3,-1). That's possible if there are no walls. Are there walls in that area?

The observation lists walls at (3,0), (3,1), etc., but not at (-3,-1). So moving left to (-3,-1) should be possible. Then pick up the ""baba"" rule, ""is"", and ""win"" to form ""baba is win"".

But this requires multiple moves. First, move left to (-3,-1) to get the ""baba"" rule. Then move up or down to get the ""is"" and ""win"" rules.

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"" already, maybe pushing the ""baba"" rule with ""is"" and ""win"" to create the new rule. But I need to be adjacent to all three text blocks.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the intended action is to move left towards the ""baba"" rule to start manipulating the rules. So the first action would be to move left.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm controlled by the Baba object since ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to reach the key, which is labeled as win, but maybe that's changeable.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key 6 steps to the right. But between me (assuming I'm at the position of the rule 'baba' which is 1 step to the left and 1 step down) and the key, there's a wall at 4 steps to the right. The wall is a stop, so I can't go through it. Also, there's a ball 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a rule 'ball' at 3 steps to the right and 1 step up. 

Hmm, maybe I need to move the ball to block the wall or create a new rule. Wait, how do I move things? I can only move objects that aren't stop. The ball isn't a stop, so maybe I can push it. Let me check the positions. The ball is at 5 steps right, 3 steps up. If I move right, maybe I can push it. But I need to see if there's a way to get past the wall by rearranging things.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules. For example, if I can make the ball a STOP, then the wall might not block me. But how? The rule 'ball' is at 3 steps right, 1 step up. If I can move that rule to say 'ball is stop', then ball would become a stop. But to do that, I need to move the existing 'ball' rule. Let me see where I am. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So my position is probably near there. 

If I move left from my current position, maybe I can reach the 'ball' rule at 3 steps right, 1 step up. Wait, but directions are relative. Let me parse the positions again. The 'rule ball' is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up from the 'baba' rule. Wait, the current observation shows rule 'baba' is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I'm at that position, moving left would take me further left, but the 'ball' rule is 3 steps to the right and 1 step up from the 'baba' rule. Hmm, maybe I need to move right towards the 'ball' rule. 

But to move right, would that cause me to hit any stops? The wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up is a stop, but if I can push the ball into the wall's position, maybe the wall becomes a stop because the ball is now there. Wait, no. The wall is a stop regardless. Unless I change its rule. Alternatively, if I can make the key the stop, but that's not helpful.

Wait, the key is the win condition. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the wall is blocking the path. So maybe I need to move the wall. But walls are stops, so I can't move them. Unless I change their rule. The wall's rule is 'wall is stop' at 1 step left and 4 step up. If I can remove that rule or change it, maybe the wall isn't a stop anymore. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall is stop' rule. 

But how do I reach that rule? The 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps up from the 'baba' position. If I move up from my current position (which is 1 step left and 1 step down), moving up 3 steps would get me to the 'wall is stop' rule. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up, which is a stop. So I can't move through that. Unless I can push the wall, but walls can't be moved. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to block the wall. If I push the ball into the path of the wall, but I don't think that would help. The wall is still a stop. 

Wait, another idea: if I can make the ball a YOU or WIN, then maybe I can use it to reach the key. For example, if I make the ball WIN, then stepping on it would win the level. But the key is already WIN. Hmm. 

Looking at the current rules: key is win. So the key is the win object. To win, I need to reach the key. But the wall is blocking the way. Maybe I can move the key? The key is at 6 steps right. If I can push it left past the wall, but the wall is a stop, so I can't push it. Unless the key is not a stop. Since key is win, but not necessarily stop unless there's a rule saying so. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So key is not stop. So maybe I can move the key. 

If I move right towards the key, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up. Wait, the key is at 6 steps right. The path from my current position (1 left, 1 down) to the key (6 right) is: right multiple times. But between me and the key, there's a wall at 4 steps right. So I need to go around it. But how? If I can move the wall, but walls are stops. 

Alternatively, maybe I can push the ball into the wall's position. The ball is at 5 steps right, 3 steps up. If I can move the ball down to the wall's position (4 steps right, 4 steps up), but the wall is there. So pushing the ball down would require moving it into the wall, which is a stop. So that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe I can move the 'ball is stop' rule. The rule 'ball' is at 3 steps right, 1 step up. If I can move that rule to say 'ball is you' or 'ball is win', then the ball would have different properties. For example, if I make the ball 'you', then I can control it. But how? 

To move the 'ball is stop' rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. If I can get to the position of the 'ball' rule (3 steps right, 1 step up), then I can move it. Let's see where I am. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So from there, moving right 4 steps would get me to the 'ball' rule's position. But along the way, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up, but that's up, not in the right direction. Wait, the wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps up is in the same horizontal line as the key. 

If I move right from my current position (baba at 1 left, 1 down), moving right 4 steps would take me to 3 steps right (since starting from left?), maybe I'm getting confused with the directions. The problem says the positions are described relative to the 'baba' rule. For example, 'rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 5 step up' means that rule is 3 steps to the left and 5 up from the 'baba' position. 

So, my current position is the 'baba' rule's position: 1 step to the left and 1 step down from itself? Wait, no. The 'baba' rule is listed as ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left"" in an earlier observation, but in the latest observation, it's ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down"". So my current position (where the 'baba' rule is) is such that to get to the actual Baba object, I need to move right 1 step and up 1 step? Or is the 'baba' rule indicating the position of the Baba object? 

In Baba Is You, the player is usually the Baba object, and the rules like ""BABA IS YOU"" define that. So the 'baba' rule here is the text block ""BABA IS YOU"", and the Baba object's position is separate. Wait, no, in the game, the player is the object that is defined as 'YOU', which in this case is Baba because of the rule ""baba is you"". So the Baba object's position is where the actual Baba tile is on the map. But in the observations provided, the objects listed include the rules and other objects like walls, key, ball, etc. The player's position is likely the position of the Baba object, which is not explicitly listed here. Wait, the problem says ""Objects on the map"" include the rules and other objects. So maybe the Baba object's position is not listed separately, but the player is controlling the Baba object based on the ""baba is you"" rule. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map based on the latest observation. 

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. 

The objects are:

- rule `wall` at 1 step left and 4 up from the 'baba' rule.
- rule `is` at 4 up (same horizontal line as the previous?).
- rule `stop` at 1 step right and 4 up.
- wall at 4 right and 4 up.
- rule `key` at 7 right and 4 up.
- rule `is` at 8 right and 4 up.
- rule `win` at 9 right and 4 up.
- wall at 4 right and 3 up.
- ball at 6 right and 3 up.
- wall at 4 right and 2 up.
- rule `ball` at 3 right and 1 up.
- wall at 4 right and 1 up.
- wall at 4 right.
- key at 6 right.
- rule `baba` at 1 left and 1 down.
- rule `is` at 1 down.
- rule `you` at 1 right and 1 down.
- wall at 4 right and 1 down.
- wall at 4 right and 2 down.

Assuming the 'baba' rule is at position (0,0) for simplicity, then:

- rule `wall` is at (-1, 4)
- rule `is` is at (0,4)
- rule `stop` is at (1,4)
- wall is at (4,4)
- rule `key` is at (7,4)
- rule `is` is at (8,4)
- rule `win` is at (9,4)
- wall is at (4,3)
- ball is at (6,3)
- wall is at (4,2)
- rule `ball` is at (3,1)
- wall is at (4,1)
- wall is at (4,0)
- key is at (6,0)
- rule `baba` is at (-1, -1)
- rule `is` is at (0, -1)
- rule `you` is at (1, -1)
- wall is at (4, -1)
- wall is at (4, -2)

So the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is (-1, -1). The goal is to get to the key at (6,0). The path is blocked by a wall at (4,0), which is part of the horizontal line from (4,4) down to (4,0). 

To get to the key at (6,0), the player needs to move right from (-1,-1) to (6,0). But between (-1,-1) and (6,0), there's a wall at (4,0) which is a stop. So the player can't go through it. 

Possible solutions:

1. Move the wall by rearranging the 'wall is stop' rule. If the player can move the 'wall is stop' rule, then the wall's property changes. For example, moving it to 'wall is you' would make the wall controllable, but that's dangerous. Or moving it to 'wall is win' would let the player win by stepping on the wall. But how to do that?

The 'wall is stop' rule is at (-1,4). The player is at (-1,-1). To reach that rule, the player would need to move up to (0,4), but there's a rule `is` at (0,4), which is movable? Wait, objects that are not stop can be moved. The 'is' rule is part of the syntax, but are they stop? The active rules don't say 'is is stop', so 'is' can be moved. Similarly, 'rule' text blocks might be movable unless specified otherwise. 

So, the player can move the 'wall is stop' rule. If the player can move that rule to a different position, say next to the wall, then the wall's property changes. For example, moving 'wall is stop' to be adjacent to the wall, so it applies to a different wall, or removing it entirely. 

But how to move the 'wall is stop' rule. The player is at (-1,-1). To move the 'wall is stop' rule at (-1,4), the player needs to be adjacent to it. The distance between (-1,-1) and (-1,4) is 5 steps up. The player can move up multiple times. But along the way, are there any stops? The path up is through (-1,0), (-1,1), (-1,2), (-1,3), (-1,4). At (-1,4), there's the 'wall is stop' rule. But moving up through these points, are there any walls? Looking at the objects, the only walls are at (4,x) positions. So the player can move up freely without hitting walls. 

So the plan is: move up from (-1,-1) to (-1,4), pick up the 'wall is stop' rule, and then move it to a different location. For example, move it to be adjacent to the wall at (4,0), changing its property. But how to apply the rule to a different wall? 

Alternatively, move the 'wall is stop' rule off the board so it's no longer active. Then the wall at (4,0) would no longer be a stop. But the rule is part of the level, so moving it elsewhere might deactivate it. 

Once the 'wall is stop' rule is removed, the player can walk through the wall. Then the path to the key at (6,0) is clear. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move up from (-1,-1) to (-1,4), reaching the 'wall is stop' rule.
2. Move the 'wall is stop' rule down or in another direction to deactivate it.
3. Move right past the former wall at (4,0) to reach the key at (6,0).

But how to move the 'wall is stop' rule. Once the player is on the same tile as the rule, they can push it in a direction. The rule 'wall is stop' is a text block, so it can be moved like any other object unless it's defined as stop. Since 'wall is stop' is a rule, and the only stop is the wall object, the rule itself is not a stop. So the player can move it. 

So the player needs to move up 5 steps to reach the 'wall is stop' rule at (-1,4). Then, move the rule in a direction. For example, move it down to (-1,3), which is a free space. That would remove the 'wall is stop' rule from affecting the wall at (4,0), since rules apply to the nearest object of the subject. 

Alternatively, move the 'wall is stop' rule next to the wall at (4,0), but that would apply the 'stop' property to that wall, which it already is. So that's not helpful. 

Once the 'wall is stop' rule is moved or removed, the wall at (4,0) is no longer a stop, and the player can walk through it. 

So the action sequence would be:

1. Move up 5 times to reach the 'wall is stop' rule.
2. Move the rule down once to (-1,3), deactivating it.
3. Move right from (-1,-1) towards (6,0), now able to pass through (4,0).

But in the current observation, after moving up to the 'wall is stop' rule, what's the next step? The action required is to choose one action based on the current observation. The current observation shows that after some previous actions, the 'wall is stop' rule is now at 1 step left and 4 step up from the 'baba' rule. Wait, in the latest observation, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 1 step left and 4 step up. So the player needs to move left and up to reach it. 

Wait, the 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So the position of the 'baba' rule is reference point. The 'wall is stop' rule is 1 step left and 4 steps up from there. So the player needs to move left 1 step and up 4 steps to reach that rule. 

But the player's current position is the 'baba' rule's position, which is 1 left and 1 down. To get to the 'wall is stop' rule at 1 left and 4 up, the player needs to move up 3 steps. Because from the 'baba' position (1 left, 1 down), moving up 3 steps would place them at 1 left, -2 down? Wait, directions are a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, the positions are relative. If the 'wall is stop' is 1 step left and 4 steps up from the 'baba' rule, then the player needs to move left 1 and up 4. But the player's current position is the 'baba' rule's position. So moving left 1 would take them to the left of that, and up 4 would be 4 steps up. 

But along the way, are there any obstacles? The path up from the 'baba' position (1 left, 1 down) to (1 left, 4 up) would pass through positions (1 left, 0 down), (1 left, 1 up), etc. Are there any stops there? Looking at the objects, the walls are all at 4 steps right,","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The key is to look at the active rules and the objects on the map. Right now, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, according to these rules, I (Baba) can move because I'm defined as ""you"", but I can't go through walls since they're stop. The goal is to reach the key, which is currently acting as a win condition because ""key is win"". But wait, sometimes you can change the win condition. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map, there's a key located at 6 steps to the right. But there's also a ball at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up. Oh, and there's a rule that says ""ball is stop"" (rule ball 1 step to the right and 1 step up). So the ball is acting as a stop. That means if I move towards the key, I need to make sure I don't step on the ball or any walls.

Starting position: The rule ""baba"" is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So my position must be somewhere relative to that. Let me visualize the grid. If rule baba is 1 step left and 1 step down from the current position, maybe I'm to the right and one step up from there. Hmm, maybe I need to move left to reach the rule ""baba"" to manipulate it. Wait, but how do I change the rules? I need to move text blocks around.

The key is at 6 steps to the right. But between me and the key, there's the ball at 5 steps right, 3 steps up, and walls blocking the path. The ball is a stop, so I can't push it or move through it. Unless I can change the ball's property. The rule for ball is at 3 steps right and 1 step up: ""rule ball"". If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what ball does. For example, making ball into ""you"" so I can turn into a ball and go through obstacles, or make it ""win"" to reach it faster.

Alternatively, the key is set as win, so getting to the key would normally win the level. But the path is blocked. Let me check my current position. If I'm at the rule ""baba"" which is 1 step left and 1 step down, maybe my actual position is 2 steps right and 0 steps up? Not sure. Let me try to map it out.

Assuming the rule ""baba"" is at (x,y), then my position is x+1 step right and y+1 step down. The key is at 6 steps right. So if I move right multiple times, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 step up, which might be part of the structure. Also, the ball at 5 steps right, 3 steps up is a stop. So moving directly right isn't possible because of the ball and walls.

Another approach: Change the ""key is win"" rule to something else. Maybe make ""baba is win"" so reaching Baba himself would win. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""key is win"" rule to a different spot or replace it. But the ""key is win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up. To move it, I have to first reach that position, but there are walls and stops in the way.

Alternatively, create a new rule. For example, if I can get to the ""is"" rule nearby, I can form a new rule. The ""is"" rules are at various positions. For instance, there's an ""is"" at 1 step down and 1 step to the left of the baba rule. If I can move the ""baba"" rule and ""is"" rule together to create ""baba is win"", that would make reaching Baba the win condition. Then I could just stand still and win.

To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule and the ""is"" rule next to each other. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step down. So if I move left to get to the ""baba"" rule, then move up or down to connect it with an ""is"" rule. Once they are adjacent, I can form the new rule.

Let me check the movement. My current position is relative to the ""baba"" rule. If I move left from there, I might be able to reach the ""baba"" rule block. Then, moving up or down to attach it with an ""is"" rule. For example, if I move left to get to the ""baba"" rule, then move up to the ""is"" rule at 1 step down, that might work. But I need to avoid walls and stops.

Looking at the map, between me and the ""baba"" rule, is there a path? If the ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down, then moving left from my position would take me to the ""baba"" rule. But I have to check if there are any stops in between. The walls are at 2 steps right and various positions, but if I'm moving left, maybe it's clear.

Once I have the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules adjacent, I can create ""baba is win"". Then, since I'm Baba and ""you"", I can just stay in place and win. That seems like a solid plan. So the steps would be: move left to reach the ""baba"" rule, then move up or down to attach it with an ""is"" rule, forming the new rule. Then, the game is won by being Baba.

Alternatively, moving the ""win"" rule to be under ""key"" might not help. The key is already win, so changing that might not be necessary. The main goal is to reach the key or change the win condition. Since the key is blocked, changing the win condition to Baba seems better.

So the action sequence would be: move left to get to the ""baba"" rule, then move up to the ""is"" rule, then perhaps move right or left to place them next to each other, forming ""baba is win"". But how to do this in the allowed actions?

Each action is a single step: up, down, left, right, or idle. So I need to navigate to the position where the ""baba"" rule and an ""is"" rule can be combined. Let's see. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down from my current position. Wait, maybe my position is such that the ""baba"" rule is to my left and one down. So to reach the ""baba"" rule, I need to move left once. Then, check if there's an ""is"" rule nearby. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step down. So from the ""baba"" rule's position, moving down once would reach the ""is"" rule. Then, I can move the ""baba"" rule next to the ""is"" rule by moving right or left, depending on their positions.

But how exactly are they positioned? The ""baba"" rule is 1 step left and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is at 1 step down. So if I move left to reach the ""baba"" rule, then move down to the ""is"" rule, they are adjacent vertically. Then, I can move the ""baba"" rule to the right next to the ""is"" rule, forming ""baba is..."". But I need to move the text blocks, which are objects that can be moved if they're not marked as stop. The ""baba"" rule is a text block; is it stop? The active rules say wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So text blocks like ""baba"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc., are not inherently stop unless specified. So I can move them.

So the plan is: move left to reach the ""baba"" rule, then move down to the ""is"" rule, then move the ""baba"" rule to the right next to the ""is"" rule, creating ""baba is win"". Then, the win condition changes, and I win by being Baba.

But each action is a single step. Let's break it down. Suppose my current position is at (0,0). The ""baba"" rule is at (-1, -1) relative to me. To get there, I need to move left once and down once. But wait, the observation says the ""baba"" rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So from my position, moving left takes me to the ""baba"" rule's x-coordinate, and moving down takes me to its y-coordinate. But I need to check if there are any stops in between. The walls are at 2 steps right and various positions, but if I'm moving left, maybe it's clear.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are relative. Let's assume that the ""baba"" rule is located at a position that I can reach by moving left. For example, if I'm at position (3,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (2,0) (1 step left), then moving left once gets me there. Then, from there, moving down to the ""is"" rule at (1, -1). But I need to ensure that the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the ""is"" rule is adjacent to the ""baba"" rule. Once I have both in my vicinity, I can move them next to each other. Then, by placing them horizontally, I can form the new rule ""baba is win"".

But this requires careful movement. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Move left to reach the ""baba"" rule.
2. Move down to reach the ""is"" rule.
3. Move the ""baba"" rule to the right next to the ""is"" rule.
4. Now, the rule ""baba is [something]"" is created. If I can append ""win"" to it, then the win condition changes.

Wait, but the ""win"" rule is elsewhere. Maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule near the ""baba is"" rule. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, just creating ""baba is win"" by placing ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then ""win"". But the ""win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up, which is far away.

Alternatively, since the current key is win, but I can't reach it, changing the win condition to Baba himself (since I'm Baba and ""you"") would be easier. So forming ""baba is win"" would make standing in place win.

To do that, I need to have ""baba"" and ""is"" and ""win"" adjacent in that order. But ""win"" is far to the right. Maybe it's better to just create ""baba is win"" by moving ""baba"" and ""is"" next to each other, and then the ""win"" part is already defined. Wait, no. The rule is formed by three text blocks: [Subject] IS [Property]. So I need ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" all adjacent in that order.

But ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 step up, which is quite far. Maybe there's another way. Alternatively, use the existing ""win"" rule and attach it to ""baba is"". For example, if I can move the ""baba is"" rule next to the ""win"" rule, then it becomes ""baba is win"".

But how to do that? Let's think. If I can move the ""baba"" rule and ""is"" rule to be adjacent, then they form ""baba is"", and then moving the ""win"" rule next to them would complete it. But the ""win"" rule is far away. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can change the subject from ""key"" to ""baba"", that would do. So moving the ""key"" rule and ""win"" rule apart, and attaching ""baba"" and ""is"" in their place.

But this seems complicated. Let's go back to the initial idea. If I can create ""baba is win"" by moving the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules next to each other, then the win condition changes. Even if the ""win"" rule is elsewhere, the new rule ""baba is win"" would take precedence.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the location of the ""baba"" rule (1 step left and 1 step down from my current position).
2. Move to the location of the ""is"" rule (which is at 1 step down).
3. Arrange them horizontally so that ""baba"" is next to ""is"", forming ""baba is"".
4. Then, the game will recognize ""baba is win"" if ""win"" is adjacent, but since ""win"" is far away, maybe the rule is just ""baba is win"" even if ""win"" is not adjacent? No, the rules are formed by placing three blocks: subject, is, property. So I need ""baba"", ""is"", ""win"" all adjacent.

But ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. That's a long way. Maybe there's a closer ""win"" rule? No, the only ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 step up (as part of ""key is win""). So maybe I need to break that rule apart.

Alternatively, delete the ""key is win"" rule and create ""baba is win"". To delete a rule, I might need to move the ""key"", ""is"", or ""win"" blocks away. For example, moving the ""key"" block away from the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks would break ""key is win"".

Then, create the new rule ""baba is win"" by placing ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together. But the ""win"" block is still present at 9 steps right and 4 step up. So I need to move it near the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to focus on manageable steps. First, reach the ""baba"" rule and ""is"" rule. Suppose I move left to get to the ""baba"" rule. From there, move down to the ""is"" rule. Then, move the ""baba"" rule to the right next to the ""is"" rule. Now we have ""baba is"" as a rule. But we need ""win"" next to it. Since the existing ""win"" rule is far away, maybe I can move the ""win"" block from the ""key is win"" rule to here.

To do that, I need to first break the ""key is win"" rule. That would require moving either the ""key"", ""is"", or ""win"" block away. For example, if I move the ""key"" block to the side, then ""is"" and ""win"" are no longer connected, breaking the rule. Then, I can take the ""win"" block and place it next to ""baba is"".

But moving the ""key"" block is tricky because it's at 6 steps right and 4 step up. To reach there, I'd have to navigate through walls and stops. The path is blocked by walls and the ball. So maybe that's not feasible.

Alternative approach: Instead of changing the win condition, try to push the ball out of the way. But the ball is a stop, so I can't push it. Unless I make the ball not a stop. If I can change the ""ball is stop"" rule to something else, like ""ball is you"", then I could turn into a ball and move through the obstacles.

The ""ball is stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. To change that, I need to move the ""ball"" block, the ""is"" block, and the ""stop"" block apart. For example, move the ""ball"" block to the side, then the ""is"" and ""stop"" would no longer be connected, breaking the rule. Then, create a new rule like ""ball is you"" by placing ""ball"", ""is"", and ""you"" together.

This could work. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move to the location of the ""ball is stop"" rule. The ""ball"" block is at 3 steps right and 1 step up, ""is"" is at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and ""stop"" is at 4 steps right and 4 step up? Wait, no. Looking back at the observation:

Objects on the map include:
rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up
wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
...

So the ""ball is stop"" rule is formed by the ""ball"" block at 1 step right and 1 step up, the ""is"" block at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and the ""stop"" block at 4 steps up? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Each rule is composed of three text blocks: [Subject] IS [Property]. So the ""ball is stop"" rule would have ""ball"" at one position, ""is"" at another, and ""stop"" at another, all adjacent in that order.

Looking at the objects:
- rule `ball` 1 step to the right and 1 step up: This is the ""ball"" part of the ""ball is stop"" rule.
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: This is a wall, not part of the rule.
- rule `stop` 4 step up: Wait, no, the objects list has ""rule `stop` 4 step up"", which might be the ""stop"" part of the ""wall is stop"" rule.

I think I'm getting confused with the positions. Let me parse the objects again:

Objects on the map:
- rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 5 step up
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 5 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 5 step up

Let's see what's going on here. I need to figure out how to get to the key or the WIN object, but the rules are still wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. The active rules mean that walls block movement, the key is the win condition, and since baba is you, moving baba should let me interact with things.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 6 steps to the right. But the path is blocked by walls. Wait, the rule 'key is win' means that grabbing the key makes me win. But how do I get there? The walls are stop, so I can't move through them. Maybe I need to reposition some rules to change the properties.

Let me check the positions. The 'rule baba' is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Then there's 'rule is' and 'rule you' right below. If I can move those text blocks, maybe I can change the rules. But the problem is that some objects are stop, so I can't just move them freely. 

Baba is you, so I can move the baba object. Wait, the 'rule baba' is a text block that says ""baba is you"". To change rules, I need to move the 'is' or 'you' parts. For example, if I can move the 'you' from being under 'baba' to another object, like ball, then ball could become you. That way, I could move the ball instead of baba.

Looking at the current setup: there's a rule at 1 step to the left and 1 step down: 'rule baba'. Then directly below it (1 step down) is 'rule is' and then 'rule you'. So the structure is ""baba IS you"". To change this, I need to either move the 'is' or 'you' to another subject. 

If I can move the 'you' to 'ball', then it would become 'ball IS you', making me able to control the ball. Then, maybe I can path through the walls by moving the ball. But the ball is at 6 steps to the right and 3 step up, which is where the key is. Wait, the key is at 6 steps to the right, same x as the ball but maybe different y. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to create a new rule that makes the wall not a stop. For example, if I can restructure the 'wall IS stop' rule. If I can move the 'stop' property to something else, then walls wouldn't block me. But how? The current active rules have 'wall is stop', so the text blocks for 'wall', 'is', 'stop' are in a row. To break that, I need to move one of them. 

But the 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. The 'wall' rule is 1 step to the left and 4 step up, and 'is' is in between. If I can move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall is stop' structure, then the rule would no longer be active. Similarly, if I can create a new rule like 'stop is die' or something else, but I don't have a 'die' text block. 

Alternatively, maybe I can make Baba a Win. Since the goal is usually to reach the Win object, which is the key here. If I can change 'baba is you' to 'baba is win', then just touching the key would make me win. But how to do that. The current 'baba' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down. The 'is' is below it, and 'you' is below that. To change 'baba is you' to 'baba is win', I need to replace 'you' with 'win'. But where is the 'win' text block? The 'win' rule is at 9 steps to the right and 4 step up. That's way to the right, blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'you' from the baba rule to the key. But the key's rule is 'rule key 5 steps to the right and 4 step up', then 'is' and 'win' follow. So if I can take the 'you' and attach it to the key, making 'key is you', then I could move the key. But the key is at 6 steps to the right, which is where the current key object is. However, the key is defined as win, so if I make it 'you', then moving the key would let me carry it to the win condition? Not sure. 

Wait, the active rules are 'key is win', so the key is both a key and a win. Maybe if I can make the key not a win anymore, then I can pick it up. But how? The rule 'key is win' is at 7,6,8 steps to the right and 4 up. To break that, I need to move the 'win' text block away from the 'key is' structure. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes 'baba' the win. For example, if I can move the 'win' text block next to 'baba', making 'baba is win'. Then, just being Baba (since I'm you) would make me win. But the problem is that the 'win' text block is far to the right, blocked by walls. 

So, the main issue is navigating around the walls. The path to the key is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 4 up, then 3 up, etc. If I could make the walls not stop, or become something else, then I could move through them. Alternatively, if I can push the walls, but I don't think you can push objects unless they have certain properties. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, some objects can be pushed if they are not stopped. But since walls are stop, you can't push them. Unless the 'stop' property is removed. 

Another approach: if I can make the ball a you, then I can move the ball to the key. The ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up. The 'rule ball' is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So if I can move the 'you' from the baba rule to the ball rule, making 'ball is you', then I can move the ball. Then, perhaps move the ball to the key's location. 

But how to do that. The current 'you' is at 1 step right and 1 step down. To move it to the ball's rule, which is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So I need to navigate to that position. But the path might be blocked. 

Baba's current position is at the 'rule baba' which is 1 step left and 1 step down. So Baba is at that position. To move the 'you' text block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. Since Baba is you, I can move the 'you' block. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move Baba (the 'rule baba' text block) to the 'you' text block's location (1 step right, 1 step down).
2. Once adjacent, move the 'you' block to the 'ball' rule's position (2 steps right, 1 step up).
3. This would create 'ball is you', allowing me to control the ball.
4. Then, move the ball to the key's location (6 steps right).

But navigating there might require moving through other text blocks. Let's see the positions:

Baba's current position: rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So in coordinates, maybe (x-1, y-1). The 'you' is at (x+1, y-1). To get to the 'you', I need to move right once. But can I move right? The wall to the right is at 4 steps right, but the path between here and there is clear? Let's check the objects:

There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So if I'm at (x-1, y-1), moving right would take me to x, y-1. Is there a wall there? The wall at 2 steps right is at x=2, y=1 (assuming current position is x=0, y=0). So moving right from x=-1, y=-1 would be to x=0, y=-1. Is there a wall there? Not sure from the observation. The observation lists walls at various positions, but maybe the path is clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 6 steps right, which is far. This might take several moves. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. If I can make the wall not a stop, then I can push through. To do that, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is at positions: rule `wall` 1 step left, 4 up; rule `is` in the middle; rule `stop` 1 step right, 4 up. So to break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks. 

If I can move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall is' structure, then the rule would be deactivated. The 'stop' is currently at 1 step right and 4 up. If I can move it down or left, that might work. But where can I move it? The areas around might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that overrides 'wall is stop'. For example, make 'wall is push' or something, but I don't have a 'push' text block. 

This seems complicated. Maybe focusing on making the ball a you is more feasible. Let's try that. 

Current 'you' is at 1 step right and 1 step down. To get there from Baba's position (1 step left, 1 step down), I need to move right once. Is that possible? The path between them is horizontal. Are there any walls blocking? The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down is to the right of the 'you' block. So moving right from Baba's position (x-1, y-1) to x=0, y-1, then to x=1, y-1 (which is where 'you' is). But between x=0 and x=1, is there a wall? The observation shows a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down, but not at x=1. So maybe it's possible. 

Once I move the 'you' block to the ball's rule (2 steps right, 1 step up), I can then control the ball. Then move the ball to the key. 

But moving the 'you' block requires being adjacent to it and then moving it. So the steps would be:

1. Move right from Baba's position to reach the 'you' block.
2. Pick up the 'you' block and move it to the ball's rule position.
3. Now, ball is you, so move the ball to the key.

But how to move the 'you' block. Since Baba is you, I can move the 'you' text block by being adjacent to it and moving in a direction. So, from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), move right to get to the 'you' at (1 right, 1 down). Then, move the 'you' block up to the ball's rule at (2 right, 1 up). 

Once that's done, the rule would be 'ball is you', allowing me to move the ball. Then, move the ball towards the key, which is at 6 right. But the path might be blocked by walls. However, since the walls are still 'stop', moving the ball through them would be impossible. So maybe after making the ball you, I need to also modify the wall rule. 

Alternatively, if I can push the walls by making them not stop. But that requires changing the 'wall is stop' rule. 

This is getting complex. Maybe the quickest way is to move the 'you' to the ball and then move the ball to the key. Let's try that.

So, first action would be to move right to get to the 'you' block. But the previous actions had the assistant trying 'left' multiple times, which might not be correct. Maybe the correct path is to move right. 

In the last observation, after several failed attempts, the latest observation shows that moving left might not be the right direction. The key is at 6 steps right, so moving right makes more sense. 

So the plan is:

1. Move right from Baba's position to reach the 'you' block.
2. Take the 'you' block and move it to the ball's rule position (3 steps right, 1 step up? Wait, the ball's rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects:

rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up.

So the ball's rule is at (2 right, 1 up). The 'you' block is at (1 right, 1 down). To move the 'you' block to the ball's rule position, need to move up and right.

So from 'you' at (1r,1d), move up to (1r,0), then right to (2r,0), then up to (2r,1u), placing the 'you' there. This would create 'ball is you'.

Once that's done, I can move the ball to the key at 6r. But the path from ball's position (2r,1u) to key (6r) is blocked by walls at 4r,4u, 3u, etc. So maybe I need to make the walls not stop. 

Alternatively, after making ball you, maybe I can push the walls by making them pushable. But without changing their properties, they are stop. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe another approach: create a rule that makes 'key is you', so touching the key makes me you, but I'm already you. Not sure. 

Alternatively, make 'baba is win', so just being Baba makes me win. To do that, need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba'. The 'win' is at 9r,4u. That's far away. 

Alternatively, move the 'win' to the Baba's rule. The Baba's rule is at 1l,1d. So moving the 'win' there would make 'baba is win'. But the 'win' is currently at 9r,4u. How to get it there? It would require moving it left 8 steps and down 3 steps, which is impossible due to walls. 

Another idea: use the existing 'key is win' rule. If I can grab the key, then I win. So the problem is accessing the key. To do that, either move around the walls by changing their properties or find a way to path through. 

If I make the wall not stop, then I can move through them. To break 'wall is stop', need to move one of the components. The 'stop' is at 1r,4u. If I can move it down to 1r,5u, breaking the rule. Then walls wouldn't be stop. 

But how to move the 'stop' block. It's adjacent to 'is' and 'wall' rules. To move it, I need to be adjacent and move in a direction. The 'stop' is at 1r,4u. Is there space around it? The wall at 4r,4u is further right. Maybe moving the 'stop' down to 1r,5u. 

But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the 'stop' block. Where is Baba located? At the 'rule baba' which is 1l,1d. So the distance is quite far. Maybe I need to navigate there. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'you' to the ball and then move the ball to the key, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, there might be a closer rule to modify. 

Wait, looking at the current active rules: 'wall is stop', 'key is win', 'baba is you'. The key is at 6r, and the ball is at 5r,3u. If I can move the ball to the key's location, maybe push the key? But the key is a separate object. 

Alternatively, if the ball is you, you can move it next to the key, and since key is win, touching it would win. 

So steps:

1. Move 'you' to ball's rule.
2. Move ball to key's location.
3. Touch key to win.

But to move the ball, need to path around the walls. The ball is at 2r,1u. The key is at 6r. The path is blocked by walls at 4r,4u; 3r,3u; etc. 

Alternatively, if walls are not stop, then ball can move through. But to make walls not stop, need to break 'wall is stop'. 

This is a loop. I think the key is to realize that you can make the ball you and then move it to the key, bypassing the walls by moving around them since the ball isn't stop. Wait, but the ball's rule is 'rule ball', which doesn't have any properties unless modified. If ball is you, then you can move it, but the walls are still stop. So moving the ball into a wall would stop you. 

Hmm. Maybe the solution is to create a new rule that allows moving through walls. For example, 'stop is you' or something, but that's unconventional. 

Alternatively, use the existing 'key is win' rule. If I can make baba a key, then touching any key (which is the same object) would make me win. So change 'baba is you' to 'baba is key', but then since key is win, baba would be win. But the active rule is 'key is win', so baba would be both key and win. Then, just being baba would make me win. 

To do that, need to modify the 'baba is you' rule to 'baba is key'. The 'you' is currently attached to baba. So take the 'you' block and replace it with 'key'. 

The 'you' block is at 1r,1d. The 'key' rule is at 6r,4u. So moving the 'you' block from 1r,1d to 6r,4u would create 'baba is key', but that's a long way. 

Alternatively, move the 'you' block next to the 'baba' rule. The 'baba' rule is","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The user has been trying different actions like left, up, etc., but the system kept defaulting to idle because the responses weren't valid. So I need to think carefully about the current state of the game and determine the correct action.

First, looking at the active rules: wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get to the key, which is defined as win. But how? The user is controlled by Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"" makes Baba the player. The walls are stop, meaning touching them makes you unable to move past them.

Now, the objects on the map. Let me parse the positions. The key is at 6 steps to the right. But there are walls to the right of it. Also, there's a ball at 5 steps right and 3 up, and a rule 'ball' at 3 steps right and 1 up. Hmm. The rule 'ball' probably means that ball has some property. But what? Since the active rules don't mention ball being anything other than a normal object unless moved.

Wait, in the objects list, there's a rule 'ball' at 3 steps right and 1 step up. That means the text blocks can be moved to create new rules. So, if I can move the 'ball' rule to combine it with other text blocks, maybe I can change the properties. For example, making 'baba' the win condition or removing the stop property from walls.

The player is Baba, located at 1 step left and 1 step down. The key is to the right at 6 steps right. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, and other walls blocking the path. Maybe if I can move the 'ball' rule somewhere to create a new rule that allows passage.

Wait, the rule 'ball' is at 3 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that rule to combine it with 'is' and 'win', maybe I can make 'ball is win', changing the win condition to the ball. Then, I can go get the ball instead of the key. But how to move the 'ball' rule?

Baba is at 1 left, 1 down. The 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. To reach it, I need to move right and up. But the path might be blocked. Let's see. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right would take him to the same position as the 'you' rule (1 step down). Then, perhaps moving up to get to the 'ball' rule. But need to check if there are any stop walls in the way.

Looking at the map, the walls are at 2 steps right and various positions up. The 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. So from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right twice would get to 1 step right, 1 down. Then up once to 1 step right, 0 down (assuming down is negative). Wait, the coordinate system might be a bit confusing. The observation mentions steps left, right, up, down. Let's assume that the player's position is somewhere, and the objects are relative to that.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 6 steps to the right, which is far. But the walls are blocking the direct path. However, perhaps by redefining rules, we can make walls non-stop. For example, if we can change 'wall is stop' to something else, like 'wall is push' or remove the 'stop' property. But to do that, we need to move the 'stop' rule.

The 'stop' rule is at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So if I can move that 'stop' rule away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how to move it? The player (Baba) needs to push the 'stop' rule text block. However, moving text blocks requires that they are not defined as stop. Since 'wall is stop', but the text blocks themselves might not be stop unless specified. Wait, the 'stop' property applies to objects of type wall. So the text blocks like 'wall', 'is', 'stop' themselves might be movable unless there's a rule saying they are stop. Looking at the active rules: 'wall is stop', but nothing about the text blocks being stop. So perhaps the text blocks can be moved.

So, if I can move the 'stop' rule (which is a text block) to a different position, then the 'wall is stop' rule would no longer be in effect. That would make walls passable. Then, the player could go around the walls to get to the key. Let's see where the 'stop' rule is located. It's at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. To move it, Baba needs to push it. From Baba's current position (1 left, 1 down), moving right three times would get to the same x-coordinate as the 'stop' rule (since 1 left to get to 0, then right 1 to reach 1 step right, then right two more to reach 3 steps right where the 'stop' rule is). But the path might be blocked. Let's check the map.

Looking at the objects, between Baba's position and the 'stop' rule, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 4 up, but that's a wall object, not a text block. The text blocks are separate. So moving right from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down) to reach the 'stop' rule at 1 right, 4 up. The movement would need to be in steps. Each action is a single step in one direction.

So the plan is: move right three times to reach the 'stop' rule, then move up to push it elsewhere. But how to push it? Each move action would allow Baba to move into the text block, effectively moving it. So if Baba moves into the 'stop' rule, he would push it one step in the direction he's moving.

For example, if Baba is at position X and moves right into the 'stop' rule, the 'stop' rule would move right by one step. Then, repeating this, the 'stop' rule can be moved to a different location, say, to the same spot as another text block to form a new rule like 'stop is win' or something else.

Alternatively, moving the 'ball' rule to create a new rule. The 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. If I can move it to combine with 'is' and 'win', making 'ball is win'. Then, grabbing the ball would make the player win. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up. So maybe after moving the 'ball' rule, go get the ball.

But how to reach the ball? There are walls in the way. If walls are stop, then the player can't go through them. But if we remove the 'stop' property from walls, then they can be passed.

So first step: move the 'stop' rule to eliminate the 'wall is stop' rule. Let's outline the steps:

1. Move Baba to the position of the 'stop' rule (1 right, 4 up).
2. Push the 'stop' rule to a new location, say, next to another 'is' or 'you' to create a new rule.

But how to navigate there? Let's consider the current position of Baba: rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So his position is probably at a starting point, and the text blocks are arranged around him.

To get to the 'stop' rule at 1 right, 4 up, Baba needs to move right once, then up four times. But there might be walls blocking the way. Let's check the map for walls along that path.

Looking at the walls: wall at 2 steps right and 4 up, 3 right and 4 up, etc. So moving up from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down) to 1 right, 4 up would require passing through coordinates that have walls. For example, moving right once to 0 steps left (or 1 step right), then up each step. But at 2 steps right and 4 up, there's a wall. So if Baba is moving up to 1 right, 4 up, he would hit that wall, which is a stop. So he can't go through it.

Therefore, moving directly to the 'stop' rule is blocked by walls. So this approach might not work. Alternative idea: use the 'ball' rule to create a new rule that allows passage.

The 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. If we can move this rule to create 'ball is you', then the ball would become the player. Then, we could move the ball to interact with other objects. Or make 'ball is push', allowing it to push walls.

Alternatively, make 'win is ball', changing the win condition to the ball. Then, go get the ball at 5 right, 3 up. But again, path is blocked by walls.

Wait, the ball is at 5 right, 3 up. There's a wall at 4 right, 3 up. So to get to the ball, would need to go around the wall. If walls are stop, then can't pass. But if we can remove the stop property, then can pass.

Alternatively, push the wall. If walls can be pushed, then moving towards the wall and pushing it. But the active rule is 'wall is stop', which might mean they can't be moved. Unless there's a rule allowing pushing.

Wait, the default in Baba Is You is that objects with 'stop' can't be moved, but if you change 'stop', maybe you can. So if we can make 'wall is push', then walls can be pushed. But to do that, need to modify the 'stop' rule.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: use the existing 'you' rule. Since Baba is 'you', maybe combining 'baba' with 'win' to make Baba the win condition.

The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 4 up. To create 'baba is win', we need to move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and 'is'.

Baba's text blocks are at 1 left, 1 down. The 'is' rule is at 1 step down (same as 'you' rule's position). The 'win' rule is far to the right. So perhaps move the 'win' rule to the left.

But how to move the 'win' rule? It's at 9 right, 4 up. To get there, Baba would have to move right 8 times, which is possible if there's a path. But there are walls at 4,5,6,7 right and 4 up. So the path is blocked. Therefore, can't reach the 'win' rule directly.

Alternative idea: use the 'ball' rule to create a new rule. If we can move 'ball' to 'is' and 'win', making 'ball is win', then grab the ball. But again, path is blocked.

Wait, the 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. The 'is' rule is at 1 step down (same as 'you' rule's position). So if we can move the 'ball' rule to the 'is' and 'win' rules, we can create 'ball is win'.

But how to move the 'ball' rule there. From 3 right, 1 up, move left to reach the 'is' rule at 1 step down. Wait, coordinates are tricky. Maybe the 'is' rule is at 1 step down from where? The 'is' rule at 1 step down is probably below the 'you' rule. So the 'is' rule is at 1 step down, same x-coordinate as 'you' which is at 1 step right and 1 step down.

So to move the 'ball' rule (3 right, 1 up) to the area of 'is' (1 right, 1 down), Baba would need to move left twice and down three times. But along the way, are there walls?

From 3 right, 1 up: moving left to 2 right, 1 up (no wall mentioned), then to 1 right, 1 up. Then down to 1 right, 0 down, then to 1 right, 1 down (where the 'is' and 'you' rules are). That path seems possible if there are no walls in between. The walls listed are at 2 steps right and various ups, but not in that lower area.

Once the 'ball' rule is next to 'is' and 'win', then combining them would make 'ball is win'. Then, moving to the ball at 5 right, 3 up (which is past some walls, but if 'wall is stop' is still active, can't pass). So this might not help unless we can also remove the 'stop' property.

This is really challenging. Maybe another angle: since the key is defined as win, and it's behind walls, perhaps the intended solution is to move the 'key is win' rule to a different position, making something else win. But how?

Alternatively, push the key to a different location. If keys can be moved, then moving the key next to Baba would make him win. But the key is at 6 right, which is blocked by walls. Unless we can move the walls.

Wait, if we can change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is push', then we can move the walls out of the way. Let's try that.

To change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is push', we need to move the 'stop' rule away from the 'wall' and 'is' rules. The original rule is 'wall is stop', formed by the 'wall' text block, 'is', and 'stop' text blocks. If we move the 'stop' rule to a different position, the original rule is broken, and we can create a new rule like 'wall is push'.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'stop' rule text block to a new location, say, next to 'wall' and 'push' (but there's no 'push' rule yet). Alternatively, move it to create a new rule.

But where is the 'push' rule? There isn't one in the active rules. So maybe create 'wall is push' by moving 'stop' to 'push', but there's no 'push' text block. Hmm.

Alternatively, move the 'stop' rule far away so that the 'wall is stop' rule is no longer connected. In Baba Is You, rules are formed when three text blocks are aligned: [Subject] IS [Property]. So if the 'stop' rule is moved away from the 'wall' and 'is', the rule 'wall is stop' is deactivated.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so Baba can move through them. Then, navigate to the key.

But how to move the 'stop' rule. Let's see its current position: 1 step to the right and 4 step up. To move it, Baba needs to push it. From his position at 1 left, 1 down, moving right three times would get to the 'stop' rule's x-coordinate (1 right), then up to 4 up. But the path is blocked by walls at 2 steps right and 4 up. So can't get there physically.

Alternative idea: use other text blocks to push the 'stop' rule. But the only movable text blocks are those not defined as stop. Since 'wall is stop', but the text blocks themselves (like 'wall', 'is', 'stop') are not stop unless specified. So they can be moved.

Wait, the 'stop' text block is at 1 right, 4 up. If Baba can move there and push it, but he's blocked by walls. So maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Another thought: the 'key is win' rule. If we can move the 'win' part to somewhere else, making the key not the win. But that doesn't help. Alternatively, make 'baba is win' by moving the 'win' rule next to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'is' rule is at 1 step down (same as 'you' rule). The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 4 up. To move it to the 'baba' area, which is at 1 left, 1 down. That's a long way, but maybe possible if walls can be moved.

But again, walls are stop, so movement is blocked.

This is really tricky. Maybe the solution involves combining the 'ball' rule with others. For example, creating 'ball is you', so the ball becomes the player. Then, move the ball to the key or win condition.

To make 'ball is you', we need to have 'ball', 'is', and 'you' aligned. The 'you' rule is at 1 step down. The 'is' rule is at 1 step down. The 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. So if we can move the 'ball' rule down to align with 'is' and 'you', we can create the new rule.

Moving the 'ball' rule from 3 right, 1 up to, say, 3 right, 1 down (but that's occupied by the wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up/down?). Wait, the walls are at specific positions. Let's check:

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, 4 right and 2 up, etc. The 'ball' rule is at 3 right, 1 up. To move it down to 3 right, 1 down, but is there a wall there? The wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down is present, but 3 right, 1 down is probably empty.

So moving the 'ball' rule down from 3 right, 1 up to 3 right, 0 up (same level) then to 3 right, 1 down. That would allow aligning 'ball', 'is' (which is at 1 right, 1 down), and 'you' (also at 1 right, 1 down). Wait, but the 'is' and 'you' are at 1 right, 1 down. The 'ball' rule would need to be moved to 1 right, 1 down to align with them. That's a distance of 2 steps left and 4 steps down from the 'ball' rule's current position.

But moving left from 3 right to 1 right is possible if the path is clear. Looking at the map, between 3 right and 1 right at the same level (1 up), there are no walls mentioned. So Baba could move left from 3 right, 1 up to 2 right, 1 up","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal seems to be getting to the key or the win object, but the current rules say ""key is win,"" so maybe grabbing the key makes me the win? Or maybe the win is somewhere else. Let me check the active rules again.

Active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So right now, I'm Baba, so ""baba is you"" means I can move. Walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The key is labeled as win, which might mean that picking it up makes me win, or that the key itself is the win object. Let me look at the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 6 steps to the right. Also, there's a ball at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps up, and a rule block saying ""rule `ball`"" at 3 steps right and 1 step up. Maybe I can move that rule to change the ball's property. But first, how do I get to the key?

Currently, the path to the key on the right seems blocked by walls. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, then another at 4 right and 3 up, and so on. But maybe I can rearrange the rules to remove the stop property from walls or create a new path.

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" is active. If I can move the ""wall"" rule or change it, maybe I can make walls not stop. For example, if I change ""wall is stop"" to ""stop is wall,"" that might invert the meaning, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if I can make a rule that says ""baba is push"" or something, maybe I can push walls aside. But I don't see a push rule here.

Another idea: The ""rule `ball`"" is at 3 right, 1 up. If I move that rule next to the ball, maybe it changes the ball's property. But the ball is currently at 5 right, 3 up. Not sure if that's useful yet.

The key is at 6 steps right. To get there, I need to move right, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 step down. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me visualize the map:

Looking at the objects:

- From the player's position (assuming initial position is where ""baba"" rule is, which is 1 step left and 1 down), maybe I need to move up or down.

But the key is to the right, blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule to somewhere else, but that might not help. Alternatively, if I can make the ball into a win, then touching the ball would win. There's a rule ""rule `ball`"" at 3 right, 1 up. If I move that rule next to the ball, it would make ""ball is win,"" but the ball is at 5 right, 3 up. So I need to move the rule block to the ball's position.

But how do I move the rule blocks? Only if they're not defined as stop. The current rules are wall is stop, so any object labeled as wall is immovable. The rule blocks themselves—are they considered walls? For example, the ""rule `wall`"" at 1 left, 4 up—is that a wall? Because ""wall is stop,"" so yes, that rule block would be stop. So I can't move it directly. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""baba is you"" rule to move. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you,"" I can move around. But the problem is the walls are stop. So I need a way to bypass the walls. Let me check if there's a way to remove the stop property from walls.

If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position, that would change the rule. For example, if I move that rule down, then the rule would be ""wall is stop"" lower on the map, effectively removing the original rule. But can I move that rule block? The rule block is at 1 left, 4 up, and it's a wall (because ""wall is stop""), so it's stop and can't be moved. That's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to create a new rule that overrides ""wall is stop."" For example, if I can make a rule that says ""stop is wall"" somewhere, but I don't have a rule block for that. The existing rules are wall, is, stop, key, etc.

Wait, the objects include ""rule `is`"" and ""rule `you`."" Maybe I can combine them with other objects. For example, if I can create a new rule like ""baba is not stop"" by moving the ""is"" and ""not"" (but there's no ""not"" rule here). Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can make ""rule`ball`"" act differently. The ball currently has a rule at 3 right, 1 up: ""rule `ball`."" If I move that rule next to the ball at 5 right, 3 up, then it would make ""ball is [something]"". But what's the something? The existing rule is ""rule `ball`,"" which I think means the ball's property is undefined or can be set. If I move that rule next to the ball, then perhaps I can change its property. For example, if I place it next to the ball and combine it with an ""is"" rule, maybe I can set ""ball is win"" or ""ball is you"".

But to do that, I need to have an ""is"" rule nearby. The ""rule `is`"" blocks are at various positions. For instance, there's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 left, 4 up, and another at 1 step down. Maybe I can move the ""rule `ball`"" to the ball's location and pair it with an ""is"" to change its property.

So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the ball's location at 5 right, 3 up.
2. Find the ""rule `ball`"" at 3 right, 1 up and move it down and right to be next to the ball.
3. Use an ""is"" rule nearby to set ""ball is win"" or ""ball is you"".

But first, I need to navigate to that area. However, moving right is blocked by walls. Let me see the path:

From the initial position of Baba (rule `baba` at 1 left, 1 down), I need to move right. But there's a wall at 4 right, 1 down. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to go up or down first.

Looking at the map:

- Up: There are walls at 3 right, 4 up; 4 right, 4 up; etc. But maybe there's a path up through the rule blocks.

Alternatively, if I can push a wall by making it pushable. But there's no ""push"" rule. Unless I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", but again, the ""wall is stop"" rule is a wall itself and can't be moved.

Wait, maybe I can use the key to override something. The key is at 6 right. If I can get the key, since ""key is win"", maybe picking it up makes me win. So how to reach the key.

The key is at 6 steps right, but the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right twice gets me to the wall at 4 right, 1 down. So I can't go that way. Maybe move up first.

Moving up from Baba's position: There's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. But perhaps I can move around it by going up and then left or right.

Alternatively, maybe use the rule blocks to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, create ""baba is push"" so I can push walls. But to do that, I need to have a ""is"" rule and a ""push"" rule. But there's no ""push"" rule present.

Another angle: The ""rule `you`"" is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe combining that with ""baba is you"" to make something else you. But I'm already Baba and you.

Wait, the active rules are ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", and ""baba is you"". So I'm controllable. The problem is the walls blocking the path to the key.

Perhaps the solution is to rearrange the rules to remove the stop property from walls. For example, if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different location, effectively deleting that rule. Since ""wall is stop"" is a rule block that's part of a wall (because ""wall is stop""), it's considered a stop and can't be moved. That's a catch-22.

Alternatively, if I can create a rule that says ""stop is not stop"", but there's no ""not"" rule. Unless I can use the ball's rule. For example, if I make ""ball is stop"", then maybe the ball becomes a wall, but that doesn't help.

Wait, the ball has a rule ""rule `ball`"" at 3 right, 1 up. If I move that rule next to the ball at 5 right, 3 up, then the rule would apply to the ball. So if I place ""rule `ball`"" next to the ball, it could define the ball's property. For example, if I combine it with an ""is"" rule, I could say ""ball is win"" or ""ball is you"".

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""rule `ball`"" block from 3 right, 1 up to be next to the ball at 5 right, 3 up.
2. Use an ""is"" rule nearby to set the ball's property.

But to do that, I need to navigate to that area, which is to the right and up from Baba's initial position. However, the path is blocked by walls. So maybe I need to move the walls first by changing their properties.

Alternatively, if I can make the ball into a pushable object or remove its stop property. But how?

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe touching the key makes me win. So I need to reach the key. The key is at 6 right. To get there, I need to go around the walls. Let's see the layout:

- From Baba's position (assuming it's at the ""rule `baba`"" location: 1 left, 1 down), moving right would hit a wall at 4 right, 1 down. Moving up, there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up. Maybe there's a way to go up from the initial position.

Looking at the map again:

Objects on the map include several walls at varying positions. The key is at 6 right. The rule blocks are scattered. Maybe the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to the key's location, but that might not help. Or move the key itself, but keys are probably not moveable unless there's a push rule.

Wait, keys in Baba Is You are usually moveable unless there's a rule saying they're stop. In this case, ""wall is stop"", but key is win. Since there's no rule saying key is stop, keys are probably moveable. So maybe I can move the key to a different location, but that might not be necessary if picking it up is enough.

But how to reach the key. Let's think about the path. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving up:

- Up once: 1 left, 0 down. Are there any objects there? Not sure from the observation. The observation lists objects with their positions relative to Baba, I think. But the exact coordinates are a bit unclear. Maybe it's better to focus on relative movements.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move that rule block out of the way, then walls would no longer be stop. But since the ""wall is stop"" rule itself is a wall (because of the rule), it's considered stop and can't be moved. That's a problem.

Wait, but there's another rule ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. What does that mean? The rule `stop` would create a stop rule. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change where stop is applied. For example, if I move ""rule `stop`"" to point at something else instead of wall.

So the active rule ""wall is stop"" comes from the ""rule `wall`"" block at 1 left, 4 up, combined with the ""is"" block at 2 left, 4 up. So the rule is formed by ""rule `wall`"" + ""is"" + ""stop"", making ""wall is stop"".

If I can rearrange those blocks to make a different rule, like ""stop is wall"" or ""wall is not stop"", that would change the meaning. But how?

Let me think. The ""rule `wall`"" is at 1 left, 4 up. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 4 up. The ""stop"" is at 1 right, 4 up. So combining them in that order makes ""wall is stop"".

If I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" blocks to different positions, the rule would change. For example, if I move the ""is"" to be after ""stop"", it would be ""stop is wall"", which is different.

But to do that, I need to move those blocks. Are they movable? The ""rule `wall`"" is a wall (due to the ""wall is stop"" rule), so it's stop and can't be moved. The ""is"" block is probably not a stop unless there's a rule saying so. Similarly, the ""stop"" block is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, so it's a stop.

This seems really complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Let's consider that the key is win, so if I can get to the key, I win. The key is at 6 right. How to get there?

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `ball`"" at 3 right, 1 up. If I can make the ball into a path by changing its property, maybe I can walk over it. For example, making ""ball is you"" or ""ball is push"". But to do that, I need to move the ""rule `ball`"" next to the ball and use an ""is"" rule.

So steps:

1. Move right to reach the area around the ball.
2. Move the ""rule `ball`"" block to be next to the ball.
3. Use an ""is"" rule to set ""ball is you"" or another property that allows movement over it.

But again, the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to adjust the wall rules first.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is push"", then I can push walls aside. To do that, I need to create a rule ""baba is push"". To create that rule, I need the ""rule `baba`"" block, an ""is"" block, and a ""push"" block. But there's no ""push"" rule present. The available rules are wall, is, stop, key, win, you.

Wait, the objects include ""rule `you`"" at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe combining ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" to make ""baba is you"", but that's already the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to try moving towards the key and see if I can find a way around the walls by rearranging rules on the fly.

Another approach: Since the key is win, and it's located at 6 right, perhaps I can move the ""key is win"" rule to be next to the key, but that's where it already is. Alternatively, move the key itself by pushing it if I can become pushable.

Wait, if I can make ""baba is push"", then I can push the key. So how to create that rule. Let's see:

- There's a ""rule `baba`"" at 3 step to the left and 1 step down.
- There's an ""is"" at 2 step to the left and 1 step down.
- There's a ""you"" at 1 step to the left and 1 step down.

If I can move these blocks together to form ""baba is push"". But there's no ""push"" block. Unless I can use the existing blocks creatively. For example, ""baba is you"" is already a rule. Maybe ""baba is [something else]"".

Alternatively, use the ""rule `ball`"" to create a new rule. If I move ""rule `ball`"" next to ""baba"" and use an ""is"" rule, maybe I can make ""baba is ball"", but that doesn't help.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try moving in a direction and see what happens. For example, moving right, but there's a wall. What if I try moving up from the initial position?

If I move up from Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), I might reach the area at 1 left, 0 down. Are there any objects there? Not mentioned in the observation, but there's a wall at 3 right, 4 up, which might be far away.

Alternatively, move left to reach the ""rule `baba`"" block at 3 left, 1 down. But moving left would take me away from the key.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule. Since ""wall is stop"" is made of ""rule `wall`"" + ""is"" + ""stop"", if I can break that rule by moving the parts, the rule would no longer exist. For example, move the ""is"" block away from the ""wall"" and ""stop"" blocks.

But the ""is"" block is at 2 left, 4 up, and the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 4 up, and ""stop"" is at 1 right, 4 up. If I move the ""is"" block down, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, making walls no longer stop. That could be the key!

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""is"" block (which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule) away from the ""wall"" and ""stop"" blocks.
2. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them.
3. Then, go around the walls to reach the key.

But how to move the ""is"" block. The ""is"" block is at 2 left, 4 up. To move it, I","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. My goal is probably to get to the key, which is the win object. But wait, usually the win is something else, but here key is win. So I need to reach the key to win.

Looking at the map, I'm Baba. The objects are arranged in a grid. The key is 6 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are marked with the wall rule, which is stop. So I can't go through them. But wait, I'm Baba, and the rule says baba is you. That means I can push objects unless they're stop. But walls are stop, so I can't push them. Hmm.

Wait, the key is 6 steps to the right. Let me visualize the layout. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, then rule key at 7 steps right and 4 up. Then rule is at 8 steps right, rule win at 9. Then down a bit, there's a ball at 6 steps right and 3 up, which has a rule ball at 3 steps right and 1 up. So maybe the ball can be moved if I change its rule?

The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So to get past the walls, maybe I need to change the stop rule. For example, if I can make wall not stop, then I can walk through them. Or maybe make myself a stop so I can push objects? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make the ball a win instead of the key. Then I could go get the ball. But the key is still win, so that might not help. Wait, no—if I change the rule key is win to ball is win, then the key's win property is removed, but the ball becomes win. Then I just need to reach the ball. But how to do that?

Let me check the positions. The key is at 6 steps right, same as the ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up. If I can get to the ball, maybe I can change the win rule to ball. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The rule ball is at 3 steps right and 1 up. So maybe I need to move that rule somewhere else?

Wait, the rule ball is a text block. Since I'm you (baba is you), I can move text blocks unless they're stop. The walls are stop, but the rule ball is not. So I can pick up the rule ball and move it. If I move it next to the ball, then the ball would become a different property. For example, if I make ball is win, then touching the ball would make me win. But right now, the rule win is pointing to the key. So if I can replace that rule, maybe I can change the win condition.

So the plan might be: move the rule ball to be next to the ball, making it ball is win. Then go to the ball and win. But how to do that? Let's see.

First, my current position isn't clear from the observation, but based on the objects, maybe I'm near the baba rule. The rule baba is at 1 step left and 1 down. So if I'm at that position, I can move around.

Wait, the objects include rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down. So if I'm at the baba rule's position, I can move left or down. But I need to figure out where I am. The key is 6 steps to the right, so maybe I'm positioned somewhere in the middle.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the key's rule. The rule key is at 7 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that rule away, then key is no longer win. But that might not help unless I can make another object win.

Another approach: Since I'm you, I can move text blocks. The rule ball is at 3 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that rule to be next to the ball, which is at 5 steps right and 3 up, then ball would become whatever the rule says. So if I move the rule ball next to the ball, then ball is whatever property the rule has. Right now, the rule ball is probably saying ball is [something], maybe nothing, or maybe ball is push or something else. Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at 3 steps right and 1 up. So that rule is saying ball is whatever comes next. But in the active rules, there's no active rule for ball except the rule block itself. So if I move that rule next to the ball, then the ball would inherit that rule. But what's the rule's current statement?

The rule `ball` at 3 steps right and 1 up is a text block that says ""ball is ..."". But in the active rules, it's not listed. So maybe the rule ball is not active yet. To make it active, I need to place it next to the ball object. So if I move the rule ball to be adjacent to the ball, then ball would have whatever property that rule defines. For example, if the rule ball says ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win the game.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the rule ball (at 3 right, 1 up) to be next to the ball (5 right, 3 up).
2. Then go to the ball and win.

But how to do that? The rule ball is at 3 right, 1 up. To get to the ball at 5 right, 3 up, I need to move the rule ball down and right. Since I'm Baba, I can move the rule ball by stepping next to it and then moving it in the desired direction.

So first, I need to locate myself. The rule `baba` is at 1 left and 1 down. Assuming I'm at that position, I can move right to reach the rule ball. Let's see:

From rule baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right would take me to the same position as the rule `you` at 1 step down. Wait, the rule `you` is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. Maybe I'm adjacent to that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm at the position of the baba rule. Let's suppose I'm standing on the rule `baba` block. Then moving right would take me to the rule `is` block at 2 left and 1 down. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win"" instead of ""key is win"". But how? The current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If I can create a new rule ""baba is win"", then touching Baba (myself) would make me win. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks to create that rule.

The ""is"" blocks are at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` at 2 step left and 4 up, and another at 6 steps right and 4 up, etc. The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 up. So if I can take the ""is"" block and the ""win"" block and place them next to ""baba"", then that would create ""baba is win"".

But where is the baba object? The rule `baba` is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So if I can move the ""is"" block from 2 left and 4 up to next to the baba rule, and then the ""win"" block from 7 right and 4 up to next to that, then the rule would be ""baba is win"".

But moving those blocks would require navigating through the walls. The walls are at 4 steps right and 4 up, and others. So the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the existing ""key is win"" rule to make ""key is stop"", but that doesn't help because the key is still a win.

Wait, another idea: If I can make ""key is stop"", then the key becomes a stop, but I need to reach it anyway. Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, make ""baba is key"", but then I would turn into a key, which might not help unless keys are win, but key is already win.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let's recap:

- Active rules: wall stops, key is win, baba is you.
- Objects: walls, key, ball, and rules for those.

Goal: Reach the key (which is win) or change the win condition to something reachable.

Possible solution steps:

1. Move the ""win"" rule from the key to the ball, making ball the win object.
   - To do this, move the ""win"" block (at 9 right, 4 up) to be next to the ball (5 right, 3 up).
   - But the path might be blocked by walls.

2. Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving ""is"" and ""win"" next to ""baba"".
   - Need to move ""is"" (from 4 up or 7 right, 4 up) and ""win"" (7 right, 4 up) to be next to ""baba"" (1 left, 1 down).

3. Another option: Use the ball's rule. If I can make the ball ""win"", then touch it.

Let me try to outline the steps for option 2: Create ""baba is win"".

- The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 4 up.
- The ""is"" rule is at 8 steps right and 4 up (since rule `is` is at 7 steps right and 4 up, next to the ""win"" rule).
- The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step down.

So, need to move the ""is"" from 8 right,4 up to be next to ""baba"", and the ""win"" from 7 right,4 up to be next to that.

But how to do that? Since I'm Baba (you), I can move the text blocks unless they're stop. The walls are stop, but the text blocks like ""is"" and ""win"" are not. So I can pick them up and move them.

Starting position: Assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's location (1 left, 1 down).

First, move right to get to the area near the upper rules. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up. So the path might be blocked. Let's see the layout:

Looking at the objects:

- Upper part has walls at 4 steps right and 4 up, then rule key at 7, rule is at 8, rule win at 9.

Then below, at 4 steps right and 3 up is a wall, 6 steps right and 3 up is the ball, etc.

So the upper part is a row of walls and rules. To get to the ""is"" and ""win"" rules at 8 and 9 right,4 up, I need to go through the walls at 4 right,4 up. But those are walls (stop), so I can't move through them. Unless I change their rule.

Wait, the wall rule is ""wall is stop"". If I can change that to ""wall is push"", then I can push the walls. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make myself a stop, then I can't push anything. Not helpful.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe another approach.

What if I use the ball's rule? The rule `ball` is at 3 steps right and 1 step up. If I move that rule next to the ball, then the ball's property changes. For example, if the rule says ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would win.

So to do that:

1. Move the rule `ball` from 3 right,1 up to be next to the ball at 5 right,3 up.

But how to navigate there? The path might be blocked by walls. Let's see:

From the rule `ball` at 3 right,1 up, moving down to 3 right,2 up (there's a wall there), then right to 4 right,2 up (wall), then right to 5 right,2 up (wall). Then up to 5 right,3 up (ball). But there are walls blocking the path. So maybe I need to move the walls out of the way by changing their rules.

But the walls are defined by ""wall is stop"". If I can create a rule that says ""wall is push"", then I can push the walls. But to create that rule, I need to have the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""push"" arranged correctly.

But the available text blocks are:

- rule `wall` at various positions
- rule `is` at multiple positions
- rule `stop`, `key`, `win`, `ball` at certain positions.

So maybe I can create a new rule ""wall is push"" by moving the ""wall"" rule, ""is"", and ""push"" (but where is push?) Wait, there's no push rule mentioned. The available properties are stop, win, key, ball, you, is.

So unless there's a push text block somewhere, I can't create that rule. Looking at the objects, I don't see a push rule. So that's not possible.

Back to the ball's rule. If I can move the rule `ball` to the ball, making it ""ball is win"", then touching the ball would make me win. To do that, I need to move the rule `ball` from 3 right,1 up to 5 right,3 up (next to the ball).

The path from 3 right,1 up to 5 right,3 up:

- Right to 4,1 up (wall)
- Can't go right because there's a wall at 4 right,1 up.
- So maybe down to 3 right,2 up (wall), can't go down.
- Alternatively, up to 3 right,2 up (wall), same issue.

Hmm, blocked. Maybe I need to move the walls first. But without a push rule, I can't.

Alternative idea: Use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can move the key to a different location, but the key is an object, and I can only move it if it's not stop. The key's rule is ""key is win"", but that doesn't make it movable. Unless ""win"" makes it movable. Wait, no. The properties like stop, push, etc., determine movability. Since key is not defined as stop, maybe I can move it. But the key is at 6 steps right. To get to it, I need to navigate through the walls.

But the walls are at 4 steps right and 4 up, and others. So the path from Baba's position (assuming near the baba rule at 1 left,1 down) to the key at 6 right would require moving right past the walls.

But there's a wall at 4 right,4 up, and below that at 4 right,3 up, 2 up, etc. So probably the direct path is blocked. Maybe there's a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the ball can be used to push the walls. If the ball is pushable, then I can move it into the walls and push them aside. But the ball's rule is ""rule ball"" at 3 right,1 up. By default, the ball's property isn't defined, so it's probably movable unless stop. But since there's no rule saying ball is stop, it's movable.

So if I can move the ball and use it to push walls, that might open a path.

For example, move the ball from 5 right,3 up towards the walls at 4 right,3 up. If I push the ball into the wall, maybe the wall moves? But walls are defined by ""wall is stop"", so pushing them might not work unless they're push.

Alternatively, if I can change the wall's rule to ""wall is push"", then I can push them. But again, I need the text blocks for that.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps again:

1. Move the ""win"" rule to the ball, making ball the win object.
   - Need to move ""win"" from 9 right,4 up to 5 right,3 up (next to ball).
   - Path blocked by walls at 4 right,4 up and others. Can't move through walls.

2. Create ""baba is win"" rule.
   - Move ""is"" and ""win"" next to ""baba"".
   - ""is"" is at 8 right,4 up, ""win"" at 9 right,4 up.
   - Need to move them down to near ""baba"" at 1 left,1 down.
   - Path blocked by walls at 4 right,4 up.

3. Use the ball's rule to make it win.
   - Move ""rule ball"" next to ball.
   - Blocked by walls.

4. Push walls away using the ball.
   - If balls are pushable, push them into walls to move walls.
   - But ball's rule doesn't define it as push, so maybe it's movable.
   - Let's try moving the ball at 5 right,3 up towards the wall at 4 right,3 up.
   - To do that, I need to navigate to the ball's position.

Assuming I'm at the baba rule's position (1 left,1 down), moving right twice would get me to 2 left,1 down, then right to 1 left (origin?), this is confusing without coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 6 right, so I need to move right multiple times. But the path is blocked by walls at 4 right.

Wait, looking at the objects:

- At 4 steps right and 4 up: wall
- At 4 right,3 up: wall
- At 4 right,2 up: wall
- At 4 right,1 up: wall
- At 4 right: wall
- At 4 right,1 down: wall
- At 4 right,2 down: wall

So from the key at 6 right, the path to the right is clear, but to the left, there are walls starting at 4 right. So to get to the key, I need to go around the walls. But how?

If I can move the walls by pushing them, but they are stop unless their rule is changed. Alternatively, if I can change the wall's rule to something else.

Another idea: Since the ball is at 5 right,3 up, and there's a","

95,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The level's active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the key or whatever's defined as win, but let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map, there's a key located 6 steps to the right. But there's also a ball at 5 steps right, 3 steps up. Wait, the rule 'ball' is at 3 steps right, 1 step up. So the ball has a rule attached to it. The key is win, so if I can get to the key, that would solve the level. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. Let me visualize the layout.

The walls are pretty much forming a barrier from the right side. The key is at 6 steps right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, 4 up, and others below. The ball is at 5 steps right, 3 up. The rule 'ball' is at 3 steps right, 1 up. Maybe moving the 'ball' rule somewhere could change its property. Since 'ball is' something, if I can make it 'win' instead of 'stop', then touching the ball would make it a win condition.

Wait, but how do I move the 'ball' rule? To move a text block, I need to push it, but only if it's not defined as STOP. The current rules are wall is stop, so any wall is immovable. But the 'ball' rule itself is a text block. If 'ball' isn't STOP, then I can move it. Let me check: the active rules say wall is stop, but ball isn't mentioned as stop. So the 'ball' rule can be moved.

If I can move the 'ball' rule next to the ball object, then creating a 'ball is win' rule would make the ball the win condition. Then I could just go to the ball instead of the key. So the plan is: move the 'rule ball' (the text block) near the ball object, then I can step on it and win.

Looking at the positions: the 'rule ball' is at 3 steps right, 1 step up. The ball object is at 5 steps right, 3 step up. To get the rule to the ball, I need to move it right and up. But how? My position is probably with Baba, which is at 1 step left and 1 step down based on the last observation. So Baba's location is rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 1 step down. Let's see: if I move right from there, I can approach the 'rule ball'.

Wait, the rule 'baba' is at 1 left, 1 down. So Baba is at that position. To get to the 'rule ball' at 3 right, 1 up, I need to move right twice and up once. But there's a wall at 4 steps right, 1 step up. So moving right from Baba's position (assuming that's 0,0), moving right twice would take me to 2 steps right, 1 down. Then up to 2 right, 0 (original position?) Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is the win, and the way to get there is to remove the wall rules. But the walls are defined as stop, so touching them would make me stop. But if I can change the 'wall is stop' rule, that would help. However, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 4 up. To move that, I'd need to go there and push it, but if it's a wall itself, which is stop, I can't move it. Wait, the rule 'wall' is at 2 left, 4 up. The actual wall objects are at different positions. The rule 'wall is stop' is a text block that can be moved if it's not STOP. Since 'wall' is stop, but the rule itself is 'wall is stop', which is text, maybe it's movable. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the 'wall is stop' rule away to remove that rule, making walls not stop. Then I could walk through them. But to do that, I need to move the rule 'wall is stop', which is at 2 left, 4 up. If I can move that rule out of the way, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Let's see where I am. Baba's position is 1 left, 1 down. So from there, moving right three steps would get me to 0,1 down. Then up to 0,0. Then right to 2,0, which is the position of the 'rule stop' at 1 right, 4 up? Wait, no, the 'rule stop' is at 1 step right and 4 up. Maybe the coordinates are a bit different. This is tricky without a visual map.

Alternatively, focusing on the ball. If I can make the ball a win, then stepping on it would solve the level. To do that, I need to move the 'rule ball' (which is at 3 right, 1 up) next to the ball object (5 right, 3 up). So I need to move the rule right and up. But how? The rule is a text block, so I can push it if it's not stop. Since 'ball' isn't stop, the 'rule ball' can be moved. So my plan is: move right from Baba's position to reach the 'rule ball', then push it towards the ball object.

Baba's position is 1 left, 1 down. To get to the 'rule ball' at 3 right, 1 up, I need to move right twice and up once. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the objects around. Moving right from Baba's position (assuming that's the starting point), there's a wall at 4 steps right, 4 up, but that's up higher. The immediate right from Baba would be towards the key area. Wait, the key is at 6 steps right, which is quite far. Maybe moving towards the 'rule ball' first.

Alternatively, maybe moving the 'key is win' rule. If I can change 'key is win' to something else, but that might not help. Wait, the key is already win, so touching it would win. But the problem is reaching it. The key is at 6 steps right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, 4 up, and others blocking the path. Maybe there's a way around by moving text blocks to remove walls or change their properties.

Another approach: since 'baba is you', I am Baba. If I can create a 'baba is win' rule, then touching myself would make me the win condition. To do that, I need to move the 'you' rule (which is at 1 step right and 1 step down) next to 'baba'. The 'rule you' is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So if I can move that 'you' rule to be next to 'baba', then creating 'baba is win' would work. Let's see where 'baba' is. The 'rule baba' is at 1 step left and 1 step down. So to move the 'you' rule next to 'baba', I need to move the 'you' rule to the left and up or down.

The 'you' rule is at 1 step right and 1 step down. So from there, moving left would take it to the same position as 'baba's rule. If I can push the 'you' rule left by one step, placing it next to 'baba's rule, then I can create 'baba is win' by moving the 'win' rule there. But the 'win' rule is at 9 steps right and 4 up, which is far away. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, focusing on the ball. If I can move the 'rule ball' next to the ball, then 'ball is win' would make stepping on the ball win. The 'rule ball' is at 3 right, 1 up. The ball is at 5 right, 3 up. To move the rule towards the ball, I need to move it right and up. From 3 right, 1 up to 5 right, 3 up would require moving right two steps and up two steps. But how to do that? I would need to push the 'rule ball' in that direction. Since the rule isn't stop, I can move it. So the path would be: move right from Baba's position to reach the 'rule ball', then push it right and up towards the ball.

Assuming Baba is at 1 left, 1 down, moving right twice gets to 0,1 down. Then up to 0,0. Then right to 3,0 (which is the 'rule ball' at 3 right, 1 up?), but coordinates might be different. This is getting confusing without a clear map. Maybe I should prioritize moving the 'rule ball' next to the ball object. Once that's done, stepping on the ball would trigger 'ball is win', allowing me to win.

So the steps would be:
1. Move towards the 'rule ball' located at 3 steps right, 1 step up.
2. Push the 'rule ball' right and up to be next to the ball at 5 right, 3 up.
3. Step on the ball, now defined as win.

To do this, I need to navigate to the 'rule ball'. From Baba's position (1 left, 1 down), moving right three times would get to 2 right, 1 down. Then up to 2 right, 0. Then right again to 3 right, 0, which is where the 'rule ball' is at 3 right, 1 up? Maybe the coordinates are relative, so moving up from there would reach the rule. Once the rule is moved, then the ball becomes win.

Alternatively, if I can't reach the 'rule ball' due to walls, maybe another approach. But given the previous failures, perhaps the correct action is to move right towards the 'rule ball' to position myself to push it.

The active rules are still wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move, but walls stop me. The goal is to get the key, which is a win condition.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 5 steps to the right. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up, then more walls to the right. Wait, the key is 5 steps right, same as the wall? Wait, the key is at 5 steps to the right, and there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. Maybe the layout is a bit confusing. Let me visualize this.

Baba is at 2 steps left and 1 down. So my position is somewhere left of the key. The key is to the right, but there's a wall blocking directly right? Let me check the objects again. The key is at 5 steps to the right, and the wall is at 3 steps right and 4 up. Maybe the path isn't straight. There's a ball at 5 steps right and 3 steps up. Also, there's a rule ball at 2 steps right and 1 up. 

The rule ""ball is stop""? Wait, no, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. But there's a rule block saying ""rule ball 2 steps right and 1 up"", which would create the rule ""ball is [something]"". Wait, the objects list has ""rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So that means the text blocks are arranged such that when moved, they form new rules. For example, if I move the ball's rule block next to ""ball"", maybe I can change its property.

But right now, the active rules don't include ball being stop or anything. So the ball is movable unless it's under a stop rule. Let me check if any ball is under a stop. The walls are at 3 steps right and 4 up, etc., but the ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up, which is not under a wall. So the ball can be moved.

My goal is to get to the key. The key is at 5 steps right. But moving right directly might hit a wall. Let me see the path. From Baba's position (2 left, 1 down), if I go right, I can move towards the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged in a way that blocks the straight path. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to make the ball a stop or something else.

Wait, the key is defined as win, so if I reach the key, I win. But the key is at 5 steps right, which is possibly blocked by a wall. Let me check the objects again. The key is at 5 steps to the right. The walls are at 3 steps right and 4 up, 3 steps right and 3 up, etc. So the path to the key might be blocked by walls. But maybe there's a way to move the rule blocks to change the rules.

Looking at the rule blocks, there's a rule `ball` at 2 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that rule next to ""ball"", maybe I can change what ball does. For example, making ball a stop or you. But how to get there?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move the text blocks that are not stop. The rule blocks are probably movable unless they are part of a stop rule. The active rules are wall is stop, so any text block that forms a rule about wall would be stop. But the other rule blocks like key, is, win, ball are movable.

So, maybe the strategy is to move the rule `ball` next to the ball object to create a new rule. For example, if I move the rule `ball` to be adjacent to the ball, then the rule would be ""ball is [something]"". But what's the something? The rule block says ""rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up"", which when placed next to the ball, would create ""ball is [the property]"". Wait, the rule blocks are the text ""ball"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc. So if I have a rule block ""ball"" and place it next to ""is"" and another property, like ""stop"", then it forms ""ball is stop"".

But in the current setup, there's a rule `ball` at 2 steps right and 1 up. If I can move that rule block next to the ball and another property, I can change the rule. Let's see: the ball is at 5 steps right and 3 up. The rule `ball` is at 2 steps right and 1 up. So moving the rule `ball` down and right towards the ball. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the rule `is` or another property block to form a new rule. For example, if I can get ""ball is win"" or ""ball is you"", that might help. But the active rules are key is win, so if I make ball win, then touching the ball would win.

But how to do that. Let's see the objects: there's a rule `win` at 8 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that rule next to ball and is, that would create ""ball is win"". But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I need to reach the key. But the key is at 5 steps right, and there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. So the path from Baba (2 left, 1 down) to the key (5 right) might require navigating around walls. Let's map the possible path.

Baba's position: rule `baba` is at 2 left, 1 down. So assuming Baba is at that position. To move right, each step right increases the x-coordinate. The key is at 5 steps right. So moving right three times would get to x=5. But along the way, there are walls at 3 steps right and 4 up, etc. Wait, perhaps the walls are arranged vertically. Let's try to visualize the grid.

Assuming the map is a grid where each object's position is relative to Baba. For example, ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"" would be 2 steps left and 4 up from Baba's position. Similarly, ""wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up"" is 3 right, 4 up.

So plotting these:

Baba's position: (0,0) [assumed]

Objects:

- rule `wall` at (-2, 4)
- rule `is` at (-1, 4)
- rule `stop` at (1, 4)
- wall at (3,4)
- rule `key` at (6,4)
- rule `is` at (7,4)
- rule `win` at (8,4)
- wall at (3,3)
- ball at (5,3)
- wall at (3,2)
- rule `ball` at (2,1)
- wall at (3,1)
- wall at (3,0)
- key at (6,0)
- rule `baba` at (-2,-1)
- rule `is` at (-1,-1)
- rule `you` at (1,-1)
- wall at (3,-1)
- wall at (3,-2)

So the grid looks like this (simplified):

y=4: [-2: rule wall], [-1: rule is], [1: rule stop], [3: wall], [6: rule key], [7: rule is], [8: rule win]
y=3: [3: wall], [5: ball]
y=2: [3: wall]
y=1: [2: rule ball], [3: wall]
y=0: [3: wall], [6: key]
y=-1: [-2: rule baba], [-1: rule is], [1: rule you], [3: wall]
y=-2: [3: wall]

Baba is at (-2,-1). The key is at (6,0). The path to the key is blocked by walls at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), (3,-1), (3,-2). So the direct path right is blocked by a vertical wall at x=3 from y=-2 to y=4.

So how to get past this? Maybe by moving the rule blocks to change the rules. For example, making the wall not a stop, or making Baba able to push things.

Currently, wall is stop, so can't move through walls. But if I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or remove it, that might help. However, the original rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. To change these, I need to move the rule blocks that form these rules.

The active rules are formed by the text blocks arranged as ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the existing rules are:

- wall IS stop (formed by rule `wall` at (-2,4), rule `is` at (-1,4), rule `stop` at (1,4))
- key IS win (rule `key` at (6,4), rule `is` at (7,4), rule `win` at (8,4))
- baba IS you (rule `baba` at (-2,-1), rule `is` at (-1,-1), rule `you` at (1,-1))

To change a rule, I need to move these text blocks. For example, to remove ""wall is stop"", I would need to move one of those blocks. But the blocks are likely immovable if they are part of a stop rule. Wait, the tips say you can only move objects or text that are not defined as ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. So the rule blocks that are part of a stop rule (like the ""wall is stop"" rule) might be stop themselves, making them immovable.

Looking at the objects, the rule `stop` is at (1,4), which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. So that text block is part of a stop rule, so it's immobilized. Similarly, the other rule blocks in the active rules might be immobilized.

So maybe the only movable text blocks are the ones not part of the active stop rules. Let's check:

- rule `ball` at (2,1): not part of any active rule, so movable.
- The key at (6,0): it's an object, not a text block, so it's probably a win object but can be moved unless blocked.
- The ball at (5,3): movable unless under a stop rule. Since wall is stop, but the ball isn't under a wall, it's movable.

So the strategy could be to move the rule `ball` to create a new rule. For example, if I can place ""ball is you"" or ""ball is win"", then interacting with the ball would make me win or let me push it.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" or ""win"" rule blocks to modify existing rules. For instance, moving the ""win"" rule next to the key to reinforce it, but that might not help. Or moving the ""stop"" rule elsewhere.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule, so it's immobilized. To change that, I need to either break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving its components. But the ""wall"" part is at (-2,4), ""is"" at (-1,4), ""stop"" at (1,4). If I can move one of these, that would break the rule. However, the ""stop"" at (1,4) is part of the rule, so it's immobilized. Similarly, the ""wall"" and ""is"" blocks might be immobilized because they're part of a stop rule.

This seems tricky. Maybe another approach: since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move. The key is at (6,0), but it's behind a wall at (3,0). However, there's a rule `ball` at (2,1). If I can move that rule block down to (3,0) or somewhere to create a new rule that allows passing through the wall.

For example, if I create ""wall is you"", then walls would become passable since ""you"" can move through them. But how to create that rule. The existing rule is ""wall is stop"", so to change it, I need to replace the ""stop"" with ""you"". To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block (which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule) and replace it with ""you"".

But the ""stop"" block is at (1,4) and is immobilized. The only movable text block I see is ""rule `ball`"" at (2,1). If I can move that to (1,4), but that's where the ""stop"" is. Maybe rearrange the blocks to form ""wall is you"".

Let's see: the current ""wall is stop"" is formed by the blocks at (-2,4) [wall], (-1,4) [is], (1,4) [stop]. To change it to ""wall is you"", I need to replace the ""stop"" with ""you"". But the ""you"" block is at (1,-1), part of the ""baba is you"" rule. That block is probably immobilized because it's part of an active rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"" by placing ""wall"", ""is"", ""you"" in adjacent blocks. The ""you"" block is at (1,-1), which is 4 steps down from Baba's position. To get there, I need to move down, but the path might be clear.

Baba is at (-2,-1). To move down to (1,-1), I need to go right 3 steps and down 0. Wait, (-2,-1) to (1,-1) is 3 steps to the right. But there's a wall at (3,-1). So I can't go right past x=2 without hitting the wall at x=3.

Hmm, this is complicated. Maybe another angle: use the ball to push the key. If the ball can be made movable or a pushable object, then pushing it towards the key might help. But the ball's current rule is not defined; the active rules don't mention ball. So the ball is just an object, movable unless under a stop. Since there's no ""ball is stop"" rule, it's movable.

If I can move the ball next to the key, then maybe I can use it to block a wall or reach the key. But the key is at (6,0), and the ball is at (5,3). To move the ball down to (5,0), but there's a wall at (3,0) blocking the path. Unless I can move the wall.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes the ball a stop, then place it in front of the wall to block it. But to do that, I need to create ""ball is stop"" by moving the relevant rule blocks.

The rule `ball` is at (2,1). If I can move that to (5,3) next to the ball and then add ""stop"", but where is the ""stop"" block? The ""stop"" block is at (1,4), which is immobilized. So maybe this isn't possible.

Wait, there's a rule `win` at (8,4). If I can move that to create a new rule. For example, ""key is win"" is already active. Maybe making ""ball is win"" would let me win by touching the ball.

To do that, I need to place ""ball"", ""is"", ""win"" in adjacent blocks. The ""win"" block is at (8,4). The ""ball"" block is at (2,1). The ""is"" block is at various places, like (7,4), (-1,4), etc.

If I can move the ""is"" block from (7,4) to near the ball, and then move the ""win"" block there. Let's see:

- The ""is"" block at (7,4) is part of the ""key is win"" rule. Moving it would break that rule. But maybe it's immobilized because it's part of an active rule.

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at (-1,4), which is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. Also immobilized.

This seems difficult. Maybe the only movable text block is ""rule `ball`"" at (2,1). If I can move that down to (5,3) where the ball is, then place an ""is"" and ""win"" next to it. But where are the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks?

The ""win"" block is at (8,4), which is far away. The ""is"" blocks are at (7,4), (-1,4), etc., also far. So moving the ""ball"" rule block to (5,3) and then trying to get ""is"" and ""win"" there might not be feasible.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at (1,-1), which is part of ""baba is you"". That block is immobilized.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to move the rule `ball` next to the ball to create a rule like ""ball is [something]"". For example, if I move the rule `ball` down to (5,2) and then add an ""is"" and ""you"" next to it, making ""ball is you"". Then the ball would become a you, meaning I can move on top of it.

Let's see: current rule `ball` is at (2,1). To get to (5,3), the ball's position, I need to move right 3 and up 2. But moving the rule block there might allow creating a new rule.

Alternatively, move the rule `ball` to (5,3) adjacent to the ball. Then, if I can place an ""is"" and a property next to it, like ""you"", to make ""ball is you"".

The ""you"" block is at (1,-1), which is 3 steps right and 2 steps up from the current rule `ball` position (2,1). So moving right 3 to x=5, up 2 to y=3, which is where the ball is. Then, from there, move the ""you"" block from (1,-1) to (5,3), but that's a long way","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So, I'm Baba because of ""baba is you"". The goal is to get to the key since it's set as win, or maybe change the win condition. But first, I need to navigate the walls which are stops.

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 5 steps to the right. But there are walls blocking the path. The key is 5 steps right, and I'm currently at the position of rule `baba` which is 2 steps left and 1 step down from where I guess I am. Wait, maybe I need to check my position more precisely. 

The objects list has rule `baba` at 2 steps left and 1 step down. So if I'm at that position, I can move around. Let me see the surrounding objects. To the right there's a wall, but maybe I can move left to get around. Wait, moving left from the baba rule would take me towards the wall at 2 steps left and 4 up? Not sure. Maybe I need to reorient.

Alternatively, the key is 5 steps to the right, but between me and the key there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 up, then another wall at 3 steps right and 3 up, and the key is at 6 steps right and 4 up. Wait, the objects list shows the key at 6 steps right and 4 up. So the path to the key is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move the key rule or the stop rule?

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. If I can change the rule so that key is not stop, then maybe I can move over walls. But how? To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. For example, if there's a rule like ""stop is wall"", moving that might help. Wait, looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 1 step to the right and 4 step up. So the rule is ""stop is wall""? Wait, the rule `stop` 4 step up—maybe the text blocks are arranged as ""stop IS wall""? Let me check.

The objects list has rule `wall` at 2 left, 4 up; rule `is` at 1 left, 4 up; rule `stop` at 4 step up. So putting that together, it's ""wall IS stop""? Wait, the rule `wall` is followed by `is` and then `stop`, so that would make ""wall IS stop"". Wait, no. The rules are formed by text blocks in the format ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the first three objects in the upper left are rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`, which together form ""wall IS stop"". Then further to the right, there's rule `key`, rule `is`, rule `win`, making ""key IS win"".

So the current rules are:
- wall IS stop
- key IS win
- baba IS you

So walls are stops, meaning I can't move through them. The key is the win condition. So I need to reach the key, but it's blocked by walls. How to get past the walls? Maybe by changing the stop rule. If I can make stop not a wall, but something else, then the walls wouldn't stop me. To do that, I need to move the text blocks that make up the ""wall IS stop"" rule.

Looking at the positions, the ""wall IS stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks:
- rule `wall` at 2 left, 4 up
- rule `is` at 1 left, 4 up
- rule `stop` at 4 step up (but the position coordinates might be different; need to check the exact positions).

Wait, the exact positions are a bit confusing. Let me parse the objects list again:

Objects on the map:
- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 4 step up
- rule `stop` 4 step up (but the left/right positioning isn't specified here, maybe it's directly to the right of the previous?)
- wall 3 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 8 steps to the right and 4 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up
- ball 5 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 3 steps to the right
- key 5 steps to the right
- rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step down
- rule `you` 1 step down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down

Assuming that the positions are relative to the player's current position, which is at the rule `baba` position: 2 left, 1 down. So if I'm at that spot, moving right would take me towards the right-side objects.

The key is at 6 steps to the right and 4 steps up from my position. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up, which is part of the ""wall IS stop"" rule. To get to the key, I need to either move past these walls or change the rule so that walls don't stop me.

To change the ""wall IS stop"" rule, I need to move the text blocks that make it up. The rule is composed of rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. If I can move one of these, I can alter the rule. For example, if I move the rule `stop` to a different position, the rule would no longer be ""wall IS stop"".

Looking at the positions, the rule `stop` is 4 steps up from where? Assuming the previous objects are to the left, the rule `stop` is directly to the right of the rule `is` in the upper part. If I can move the rule `stop` block, perhaps to the same row as the key rule, I could create a new rule like ""stop IS key"" or something else. But I need to see if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba a stop, which would prevent me from moving, so that's not helpful. Or make ""you IS win"", so that touching the win condition (key) makes me the win. But I need to see where the text blocks are.

The rule `you` is at 1 step down, next to the rule `is` and rule `baba`. So the ""baba IS you"" rule is there. If I can move the ""you"" block, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key IS you"", making the key the you, so that stepping on it would make me you, but since I'm already you, that might not help.

Alternatively, if I can make ""wall IS key"", then walls would be keys, which are win conditions. But I need to rearrange the text blocks for that.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe I can push it by making Baba a pusher. But by default, you can't push objects unless there's a rule allowing it. The default rules don't mention pushing, so I can't push walls or keys unless I create a new rule like ""baba IS push"" or something. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key to a different location by pushing it with another object, but again, without push rules, that's not possible.

Back to the original idea: changing the ""wall IS stop"" rule. The rule is made of three blocks: wall, is, stop. If I can move the 'stop' block out of place, the rule becomes invalid. For example, if I move the rule `stop` block from its current position (4 step up) to somewhere else, then the ""wall IS stop"" rule is broken. Then walls would no longer be stops, so I could move through them.

To do that, I need to move the rule `stop` block. Where is it located? The objects list shows rule `stop` at 4 step up, but the left/right position isn't specified. Assuming it's in the same horizontal line as the wall and is rules, which are 2 left, 1 left, then 4 step up. So if I'm at the baba position (2 left, 1 down), moving up 4 steps would reach the wall, is, stop rule area.

If I move up to the rule `stop` block and take it, then place it elsewhere, the rule would break. Let's see:

Current position: rule `baba` at 2 left, 1 down.

To reach the rule `stop` block, which is 4 steps up from where? If the previous blocks are 2 left, 1 left, then the rule `stop` is at 4 step up from the baba position. So moving up 4 steps from the baba position would get me to the rule `stop` block. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 up. Wait, maybe the movement is relative to the current position.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to the top-left corner. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to map out the grid.

Assuming that the player's position is at (0,0), then:

- rule `baba` is at (-2, 1)
- rule `is` is at (-1, 1)
- rule `you` is at (0, -1)
- The key is at (5, 4)
- Walls are at various positions, like (3,4), (4,3), etc.

But without knowing the exact grid layout, it's hard to be precise. However, the key idea is to manipulate the rules. Since the key is the win condition, and it's blocked by walls, the solution likely involves rearranging the text blocks to change either the stop rule or the win condition.

Another possibility: make ""baba IS win"", so that wherever Baba is, he wins. But the current rule is ""key IS win"". To change that, I need to move the ""win"" block from the key rule to the baba rule.

The key rule is composed of rule `key`, rule `is`, rule `win` at positions (6,4), (7,4), (8,4). The baba rule is at (-2,1), (-1,1), (0,1). If I can take the ""win"" block from the key rule and place it in the baba rule, creating ""baba IS win"", then touching any Baba (which is me) would make me win.

To do that, I need to move the rule `win` block from (8,4) to somewhere near the baba rule. Let's see:

1. Move from current position (-2,1) to the key rule area. The key rule is at (6,4). That's a long distance, but maybe possible by moving right and up.

But moving right 8 steps and up 5 steps is a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer way. Alternatively, maybe the rule `win` is part of the key IS win rule, so if I can break that rule by moving one of its components, and then create a new rule.

Alternatively, take the ""win"" block from the key rule and place it with the baba rule. For example, move down to the baba rule area and add the win block there.

But how to move the blocks? The action needs to be one of the movement commands: up, down, left, right. Then, after moving, you can push a text block if it's not stopped. Since walls are stops, but if I can change the stop rule, that might help.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the rule `win` block in the key rule and grab it, then move to the baba rule and place it there.

So step-by-step:

1. From the current position (-2,1), move right to reach the key rule area. But there are walls in the way. For example, at (3,4) there's a wall. So I need to find a path around.

Alternatively, move up to the rule `wall`, `is`, `stop` area first. If I can break that rule, walls stop being stops, allowing me to move through them.

To break ""wall IS stop"", I need to move one of the three blocks. The rule `stop` is at (4,4) perhaps. If I can move that block to another position, say next to the baba rule, then the wall rule would be disrupted.

So moving from (-2,1) to (4,4) would require moving right 6 steps and up 5 steps. But that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe there's a closer path.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""win"" block from the key rule to the baba rule. Let's see:

The key rule is at (6,4), (7,4), (8,4). The baba rule is at (-2,1), (-1,1), (0,1). To move the ""win"" block from (8,4) to near the baba rule, I need to move left and down.

From (8,4) to (0,1) is left 8 steps and down 3 steps. That's a long way, but maybe possible by moving in steps.

But considering the walls, it's going to be tricky. Perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Another angle: since the key is the win condition, maybe I can push it to a different location. But without push rules, I can't. Unless I can make myself a pusher by creating a rule like ""baba IS push"".

To create that rule, I need the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", ""push"". Do I have a ""push"" block? Looking at the objects, there's a rule `ball` at (2,1). Not sure. The available text blocks are wall, is, stop, key, win, ball, baba, you.

So to make ""baba IS push"", I need to arrange those three blocks. But I don't see a ""push"" block in the objects. Wait, the rule `ball` is present. Maybe ""ball"" can be used as a property. If I can create ""baba IS ball"", then Baba becomes a ball. Balls might have different properties, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I can make ""you IS win"", then since I'm you, touching anything (including the key) would make me win. But the current ""you"" rule is part of ""baba IS you"". If I can move the ""you"" block to the key rule, making ""key IS you"", then stepping on the key would make it you, and since I'm you, I win. But how to do that.

The ""you"" block is at (0,-1). The key rule is at (6,4). So moving from (0,-1) to (6,4) requires moving right 6 and up 5. Again, lots of steps and walls in the way.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is at (5,4), and I'm at (-2,1), maybe I can move right and up, avoiding the walls by moving around them. For example:

From (-2,1), move right to (0,1) (which is the ""you"" block position). Then move up to (0,0), but is there a wall there? Not sure. Alternatively, move up to (0,1) then right and up.

But the path to the key is blocked by walls at (3,4), (4,3), etc. Maybe if I can move through the walls by changing the stop rule.

Wait, if I can make ""stop IS key"", then walls would be keys, which are win conditions. So stepping on a wall would make me win. That could work.

To do that, I need to break the existing ""wall IS stop"" rule and create a new ""wall IS key"" rule. The existing rule is made of wall, is, stop. If I can replace the ""stop"" with ""key"", then the new rule would be wall IS key.

The ""key"" block is at (6,4). So I need to move the ""stop"" block from the wall rule to somewhere else and bring the ""key"" block into its place.

So step by step:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block's position. It's part of the wall IS stop rule, which is at positions (-2,4), (-1,4), (0,4) perhaps. Wait, the objects list says rule `wall` is 2 steps left and 4 up, rule `is` is 1 left and 4 up, rule `stop` is 4 step up. So assuming they are in a horizontal line, the stop block is at (0,4).

2. Move from my current position (-2,1) to (0,4). That's right 2 steps and up 3 steps.

3. Once at (0,4), move the rule `stop` block to a different position, say to the same row as the key rule. For example, move it down to (0,1), which is where the ""you"" block is. But I need to check if that's possible.

4. Then, take the rule `key` block from (6,4) and move it to the position where the rule `stop` was, which is now (0,1). This would create the new rule ""wall IS key"".

5. Now, walls are keys, which are win conditions. So stepping on any wall would make me win. But the key is already a win condition. So if I can touch a wall, I win. But how to get to a wall.

Alternatively, after changing the rule, just move towards any wall and touch it, which would make me win. But the key is at (5,4), which is a win, but maybe I can just walk into a wall instead.

But this requires precise movement. Let's think through the steps again.

Current position: rule `baba` at (-2,1).

Goal: move to (0,4) to access the ""stop"" block.

Movement needed: right 2, up 3.

But on the way, are there walls? From (-2,1) moving right to (0,1) is possible as","

Let's start by understanding the current state of the game. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. That means touching a wall stops me, picking up the key makes it the win condition, and since Baba is me, I can move around as Baba.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located 5 steps to the right. The win condition (which is the key) is also 6 steps to the right. But there's a rule `key` 6 steps to the right, which means key is win. So picking up the key should make it the win condition. But how do I get there?

I need to figure out the path to the key. There's a wall 4 steps up and some other walls blocking the way. Let me check the positions again. The rule `wall` is at 2 left 4 up, and the actual walls are at 3 steps right 4 up. Then there's another wall 3 steps right 3 up and 2 up, etc. So the path to the key (5 steps right) seems blocked by walls. 

Wait, but the rule `ball` is at 2 steps right 1 up. Maybe I can use that? But I'm not sure how. The ball is a separate object. If I can make the ball do something, like change the stop rule, that might help. Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules to turn myself into the ball or something that can pass through walls.

Since Baba is me, and I can move, maybe I need to move towards the key but avoid the walls. The key is 5 steps to the right, but the path there is blocked by walls. Let me see: from my current position (Baba is at 2 left 1 down), moving right might get me past the walls. Wait, the walls are at 3 steps right 4 up, which is above me. Maybe I need to go around the walls. If I move down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right 1 down. Hmm. 

Alternatively, could I rearrange the rules? The rule `key` is 6 steps right 4 up. If I can move that rule elsewhere, maybe I can make the key a different thing. But the rule `key` is fixed unless I can move the text blocks. Wait, the rules are made of text blocks. So if I can pick up the `key` text block and move it, I could change what the key does. For example, moving `key is win` to make `baba is win`, so touching Baba would be the win condition. But how to do that?

I need to move the `key` text block. The `key` rule is at 6 steps right 4 up. To move it, I have to approach it and move right or left. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: from my position (2 left 1 down), to get to the `key` rule at 6 right 4 up, I need to move up 4 steps and right 8 steps, but there are walls along the way. For example, at 3 steps right 4 up there's a wall. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the `ball` rule. The `ball` rule is at 2 right 1 up. If I can move that rule to make `baba is win`, then I can just stand on Baba to win. To do that, I need to pick up the `ball` rule and move it next to `baba` and `is`. The `baba` rule is at 2 left 1 down. So moving the `ball` rule to be next to `baba is` would create `baba is ball`, but that doesn't help. Wait, the goal is to make `baba is win`. So maybe I need to take the `win` rule which is at 8 right 4 up and move it to be under `baba is`.

But moving the `win` rule would require navigating around the walls. The `win` rule is 8 steps right 4 up, which is far to the right. From my current position, moving right 6 steps would get me there, but there's a wall at 4 right. So maybe I can't reach it directly. Alternatively, is there a way to make the walls passable by changing the stop rule?

The current stop rule is `wall is stop`. If I can change that to something else, like `wall is nothing`, then walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the `stop` rule. The `stop` rule is at 4 step up. So moving up to that position and then moving the `stop` rule. But how? My position is 2 left 1 down. To get to the `stop` rule at 4 up, I need to move up 4 steps. Let's see: moving up once gets me to 1 left 1 down. Then up again to 1 left 0 down. Then up to 1 left -1 down (which is up). Then up to 1 left -2 down (2 up). Then up to 1 left -3 down (3 up). Then up to 1 left -4 down (4 up). Wait, but the `stop` rule is at 4 step up, which is in the same horizontal position as my current position (2 left 1 down). So moving up 4 steps would place me at 2 left 1 down - 4 up = 2 left 1 -4 up, which is 2 left -3 up. But the `stop` rule is at 4 step up, so maybe the coordinates are relative. This might be confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are relative to Baba's position. Let me try to visualize the map. Baba is at 2 left 1 down. The `stop` rule is 4 step up from there, so it's above. The walls are at 3 steps right 4 up, which would be to the right and above. So to reach the `stop` rule, I need to move up and maybe left or right. But there are walls blocking the way. For example, moving up from Baba's position (2 left 1 down) to 2 left 0 down (1 up), then up to 2 left -1 down (2 up), but there's a wall at 3 steps right 3 up, which might not be in the way. This is getting complicated.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to get to the key. But the path is blocked. However, the key is 5 steps to the right. If I can move right past the walls. Let's check the path. From Baba's position (2 left 1 down), moving right once would be 1 left 1 down. Then right again to 0 left 1 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right, which is far to the right. Wait, the walls at 3 steps right 4 up are above. The wall at 3 steps right 1 down is below. So maybe moving down is safe. Let me try moving right towards the key. 

If I move right multiple times: right, right, right, right, right. But the key is 5 steps to the right. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right 1 down. So moving right 3 steps would get me to 3 left 1 down, but there's a wall there. So I can't go past that. Hmm. Maybe I need to find a way around the walls by moving up or down. 

Looking at the map, there's a rule `ball` at 2 right 1 up. If I can move that rule to change the stop property. For example, making `stop is ball` so that balls are stop instead of walls. Then I could walk through the walls. To do that, I need to pick up the `stop` rule and the `ball` rule and rearrange them. 

So the plan is: move to the `stop` rule at 4 up, then move it next to `ball` to create `stop is ball`. Then the walls would be passable. Once that's done, I can go around the walls to the key. 

Let's break it down step by step. From Baba's position (2 left 1 down), I need to move up 4 steps to reach the `stop` rule. Each move up would be: up, up, up, up. But after moving up a few times, there might be walls blocking the path. For example, moving up once to 2 left 0 down (1 up), then up to 2 left -1 down (2 up), where there's a wall at 3 steps right 2 up. That's to the right and above, so maybe not blocking my path. Continuing up to 3 up, then 4 up. At 4 up, the `stop` rule is there. 

Once at the `stop` rule, I need to move it. To move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which should attach the text block to me. So moving up from the `stop` rule would take me away, but moving left or right. The `ball` rule is at 2 right 1 up. So from the `stop` rule at 4 up, moving left 3 steps would get me to the `ball` rule's position. Wait, the `ball` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 up relative to Baba's original position. But if I'm at the `stop` rule which is 4 up, moving left would be relative to that position. 

This is getting a bit confusing with the coordinates. Maybe a better approach is to focus on moving the `stop` rule next to the `ball` rule. So after picking up the `stop` rule, move it to the left or right until it's adjacent to the `ball` rule, then create the new rule `stop is ball`. 

Once that's done, the walls won't stop me. Then I can move freely to the key. Alternatively, if I can make `baba is win`, then standing on Baba would win the game. 

Another possibility: the `key is win` rule. If I can pick up the `key` rule and move it to be under `baba is`, making `baba is win`, then I just need to reach the key's position, which is 5 steps right. But there are walls in the way. However, if I can make walls passable by changing the stop rule, that would help. 

So the overall plan is either:

1. Change `stop is wall` to `stop is ball`, allowing walls to be passed, then go around to the key.
2. Change `key is win` to `baba is win`, allowing touching Baba to win, then just stand there.

Let me try option 2 first because it seems faster. To do that, I need to move the `win` rule next to `baba is`. The `win` rule is at 8 steps right 4 up. From my current position, that's quite far. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get the `win` rule closer. 

Alternatively, if I can move the `key` rule to be under `baba is`, making `baba is win`. The `key` rule is at 6 steps right 4 up. To get there, I need to move right 6 steps and up 4, but there are walls blocking. 

This is tricky. Maybe focusing on changing the stop rule first is better. Let's try that. 

Step 1: Move to the `stop` rule at 4 up. From Baba's position (2 left 1 down), moving up 4 times: up, up, up, up. Each move up should take me closer. 

But after moving up a few times, are there walls in the way? For example, moving up once to 2 left 0 down (1 up), then up to 2 left -1 down (2 up). At 3 steps right 2 up, there's a wall, but that's to the right of my current position. So moving up shouldn't be blocked. Continuing up to 3 up, then 4 up where the `stop` rule is. 

Once at the `stop` rule, move it left or right. The `ball` rule is at 2 right 1 up relative to Baba's original position. If I'm at the `stop` rule (4 up), moving left 3 steps would get me to the `ball` rule's position. Wait, the `ball` rule is at 2 steps right and 1 up from Baba's original position. But if I'm at 4 up, moving left would be relative to that. Maybe this coordinate system is relative to the player's position. 

Alternatively, perhaps the map is a grid, and all positions are relative to the player. So when the observation says ""rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up"", that means 2 steps to the left and 4 up from the player's current position. 

Assuming that, when the player is at their current position, the `stop` rule is 4 steps up. So to reach it, the player needs to move up 4 times. 

Once the `stop` rule is moved next to the `ball` rule, the new rule would be `stop is ball`, making balls the stop objects instead of walls. Then the player can move through the walls. 

After that, the player can move right to the key. But the key is 5 steps to the right. However, there's a wall at 3 steps right 1 down. If walls are no longer stop, the player can walk through them. So moving right past the wall at 3 steps right would be possible. 

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, once the player picks up the key, they win. So even if there's a wall blocking the path, maybe the player can move around it. 

Putting it all together, the steps would be:

1. Move up 4 times to reach the `stop` rule.
2. Move the `stop` rule next to the `ball` rule to create `stop is ball`.
3. Move right past the walls to the key (5 steps right).
4. Pick up the key, which is already the win condition, so the game is won.

Alternatively, if changing `baba is win` is possible, that would be quicker. To do that:

1. Move to the `key` rule (6 steps right 4 up) and the `baba` rule (2 left 1 down).
2. Move the `key` rule next to `baba is` to create `baba is key`.
3. But the goal is `baba is win`, so instead, need to move the `win` rule next to `baba is`.

The `win` rule is at 8 steps right 4 up, which is far away. So this might not be feasible. 

Therefore, the better approach seems to be changing the stop rule first. 

So, the player needs to navigate to the `stop` rule, move it, then proceed to the key. 

Now, considering the previous failed actions, maybe the assistant wasn't specifying the exact direction with enough precision. For example, ""up"" alone might not be enough if there are multiple directions to move. 

The correct action sequence would involve moving up four times to reach the `stop` rule, then moving it left or right to interact with the `ball` rule. 

But since the input needs to be a single action, the assistant has to choose the next immediate action. Given the current observation, the player is at 2 left 1 down. The `stop` rule is 4 up. So the immediate action should be to move up once to get closer. 

However, after moving up a few times, the player needs to adjust direction to reach the `stop` rule. But based on the latest observation provided, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are listed relative to Baba. 

Wait, in the latest observation, the objects are listed with positions relative to Baba. For example, `rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 4 step up` means that relative to Baba's current position, the wall is 2 left and 4 up. 

So the player (Baba) is at the origin (0,0) in this relative coordinate system. The `stop` rule is at (0,4). To get there, the player needs to move up 4 times. 

So the first action should be ""up"". Then repeat ""up"" four times. But since each action is a single step, the assistant needs to output ""up"" each time until reaching the `stop` rule. 

However, after moving up four times, the player would be at (0,4), where the `stop` rule is. Then, the next action would be to move left or right to reach the `ball` rule. The `ball` rule is at (2,1). From (0,4), moving left 2 steps and down 3 steps would get to (2,1). But that's complicated. Alternatively, moving left and down in steps. 

But given that the assistant can only output one action at a time, the immediate next action after reaching the `stop` rule would be to move left to start positioning the `stop` rule next to the `ball` rule. 

But in the current observation, the player hasn't moved yet. The latest observation shows that the player defaulted to idle multiple times, so the assistant needs to determine the first action. 

Given that, the initial action should be ""up"" to start moving towards the `stop` rule. 

But let's verify. The player's goal is to reach the key, but the path is blocked. Changing the stop rule seems necessary. So the first step is to move up towards the `stop` rule. 

Therefore, the chosen action is ""up"".

Let's see. The goal is to get to the key or the win object, but the active rules say ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So right now, if I touch the key, it's considered a win. But I need to reach it.

Looking at the current observation, the player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So I need to figure out where Baba is positioned. The other objects are walls, a key, and a ball. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there are walls blocking the path. 

The active rules are wall is stop, so any movement into a wall is impossible. The key is win, so touching it should win the level. But how to get there? The path to the key (5 steps right, 1 step down) is blocked by walls. There's a wall at 3 steps to the right, and another one at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So moving directly right or down isn't possible.

Wait, there's a rule `ball` at 2 steps to the right. Maybe I can rearrange the rules. If I can move the ""ball is ..."" rule, perhaps I can change the behavior of the ball. But first, I need to see if I can move any text blocks. Since the current rules are ""baba is you"", I can move text blocks unless they're stopped. The walls are stopped, but other objects might not be.

Looking at the objects, the rule `ball` is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can make the ball a stop or something else. But to move a rule, I have to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let me check the position of Baba. The rule `baba` is 2 steps left and 2 steps down from the current position. So maybe Baba is at a certain coordinate. Let's try to visualize the map.

Assuming Baba is at position (0,0), then:

- The rule `wall` is 2 left, 4 up: (-2,4)
- rule `is` is 1 left,4 up: (-1,4)
- rule `stop` is at (1,4)
- wall at (3,4)
- rule `key` at (6,4)
- etc.

But after some moves, the positions have shifted. Now, the rule `wall` is 2 left and 3 up, so (-2,3), rule `is` is (-1,3), rule `stop` at (3,3), wall at (3,3), rule `key` at (6,3), etc. The key is now at (5,2)? Wait, the current observation says the key is at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. If Baba is at 2 left and 2 down, then moving right would take him towards the key. But walls are blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the ball to break through a wall. If the ball has a different property, like ""stop"" or ""win"", but currently, the rule `ball` is at (2,1) (assuming steps translate to coordinates). If I can move that rule to make ball a different property. For example, if I make ""ball is stop"", then touching the ball would be stopped. But the goal is to reach the key, which is a win.

Alternatively, can I make ""key is you"" so that the key becomes the player? Then I could move the key to Baba's position. But to do that, I need to find the ""key is win"" rule and rearrange it.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. To move that, I need to be adjacent to it. If I can move right towards it, but there are walls in the way. The wall at 3 steps right and 1 step up might be blocking the path. Maybe I can move the ""rule ball"" to change the ball's property, allowing me to pass through walls or something else.

Wait, the current active rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So as Baba, I can move any text blocks that are not stopped. The walls are stopped, so I can't move them. The rule `ball` is at 2 steps to the right. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""ball is"" rule next to ""ball"", I can change its property. But I need to be adjacent to both the ""is"" rule and the object.

Looking at the current objects, the rule `ball` is at 2 steps to the right (so position (2,0) if Baba is at (0,0)), and the ""is"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 1 step down, which would be (-1,-1). That's not adjacent. Maybe I need to rearrange the ""is"" rule to be next to the ball.

Alternatively, the ""key is win"" rule is at (6,3). To move that, I need to be adjacent to it. But getting there requires passing through walls. Maybe I can push a wall if it's not stopped, but walls are defined as stop, so I can't move them.

Another approach: Since ""key is win"", touching the key wins. So the goal is to reach the key at (5,1) (assuming steps are coordinates). The path is blocked by walls at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), and (3,0). But maybe I can use the ball to move a wall. If the ball has a property that allows it to push walls, but currently, the only rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. There's a rule `ball` at (2,1). If I can change that rule to ""ball is push"" or something, but I don't know how.

Wait, maybe I can create a new rule by combining ""ball is"" with another property. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule next to the ball, I can create ""ball is [property]"". The available properties are probably stop, win, you, push, etc., based on the existing rules. The current rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the properties are stop, win, you.

If I can make ""ball is you"", then the ball becomes the player. Then I can move the ball to push walls or reach the key. But how? Let's see. The rule `ball` is at (2,1), and there's an ""is"" rule at (-1,-1). Not adjacent. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" rule closer. But to move the ""is"" rule, I have to be adjacent to it. Baba's position is at 2 left and 2 down, which is (-2,-2) if we consider the initial position as (0,0). Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, think about moving the ""key is win"" rule. If I can move that rule next to the key, but the key is at (5,1). The ""key is win"" rule is at (6,3). To get there, I need to move right and up, but there are walls at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). Maybe I can find a way around using the ball.

Another idea: Since ""baba is you"", I can move any text blocks that are not stopped. The rule `stop` is at (1,4), which is a wall. So I can't move that. The rule `ball` is at (2,1). If I can move that rule to, say, next to the key, then I can create a new rule like ""key is you"", making the key the player. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key. The ""is"" rule is currently at (-1,-1). Not sure.

Wait, the current observation shows that after moving up, the rule `wall` is now at 2 left and 3 up, rule `is` at 1 left and 3 up, rule `stop` at 3 up, etc. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move right from my current position, I can reach the key eventually, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""rule ball"" to create a new rule that allows passing through walls. For example, if I make ""wall is not stop"", but I can't do that directly.

Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba immune to stops. But the only way is to change the stop rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (1,4), which is a wall. Can't move that. 

Hmm. Maybe I should try to push a wall. But walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing. But there's no such rule active. 

Wait, the ball is present. If I can make the ball a push, then maybe I can use it to move walls. But how? The current rule for ball is ""rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up"". So the rule says ""ball is ..."", but what's it? The active rule for ball isn't listed in the active rules. The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So the ball's property isn't defined, meaning it's default? Or maybe it's undefined, so it's movable. 

If the ball isn't stopped, I can move it. If I move the ball into a wall, does that push the wall? But there's no rule for pushing. So probably not. 

Another approach: Since the key is a win, maybe I can reach it by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make the key a Baba, then I can turn into the key. But to do that, I need to change the ""key is win"" rule to ""key is you"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the key and change its property. 

The ""is"" rule is currently at 1 step to the left and 1 step down from Baba's position. If I can move the ""is"" rule to be next to the key, then I can create ""key is you"". Let's see. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. The ""is"" rule is at (-1,-1) relative to Baba's position (2 left, 2 down). So to get the ""is"" rule to the key's location, I need to move it right and down. But how?

Alternatively, move the ""key is win"" rule. The rule is at 6 steps right and 3 step up. If I can move that rule next to the key, then change its property. But the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. The ""key is win"" rule is currently at (6,3), so it's one step right and two steps up from the key. To move it down and left, but there are walls in the way. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the key, avoiding walls. Let's see the path from Baba's position to the key. If Baba is at 2 left and 2 down, then moving right would be towards the key. But there's a wall at 3 steps right. So can't go straight right. Maybe move up to avoid the wall? 

If I move up, from the current position, there's a wall at 3 steps up. Wait, the rule `wall` is at 2 left and 3 up. So relative to Baba, that's (-2,3). If Baba is at (-2,-2), then the wall is at (-2,3), which is up 5 steps. Moving up from there would go through that wall, which is stop. Not allowed. 

Alternatively, move right twice: first to (-2,-2) → move right to (-1,-2). Then right again to (0,-2). But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up. Wait, the wall at 3 steps right and 2 step up is at (3,2) relative to Baba's starting point. If Baba is moving right from (-2,-2), moving right to (0,-2), then next to (1,-2), which is still clear. But there's a wall at (3,3) which is blocking the path up. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to use the ball to create a path. The ball is at 2 steps right and 1 step up from Baba's position. So if I can move the ball into the wall, maybe it pushes it? But without a push rule, that's not possible. 

Another idea: Change the rule `ball` to make it act as a stop. Then the ball would block movement, but I'm not sure if that helps. Or make the ball a win, but the key is already win. 

Wait, the active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. The ball's rule is separate. If I can create a rule like ""ball is you"", then the ball becomes the player. Then I can move the ball to the key. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" rule next to the ball and change its property. 

The ""is"" rule is currently at (-1,-1) relative to Baba. If I can move Baba to be adjacent to the ""is"" rule and the ball, then I can create the new rule. Let's see. Baba is at (-2,-2). The ""is"" rule is at (-1,-1). The ball's rule is at (2,1). So moving right and up would get closer to the ""is"" rule. 

If I move up once from (-2,-2) to (-2,-1), then right to (-1,-1), which is where the ""is"" rule is. Then I can pick up the ""is"" rule and move it next to the ball. 

Once the ""is"" rule is next to the ball, I can create ""ball is you"", making the ball the player. Then I can move the ball to the key. 

But this requires multiple steps. The current observation shows that after moving up, the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. So if I can make the ball the player, then moving the ball right and down would reach the key. 

So the plan is:

1. Move Baba to the ""is"" rule.
2. Move the ""is"" rule to the ball's location.
3. Create the rule ""ball is you"".
4. Move the ball to the key.

But each action needs to be a single step. Let's see the current positions:

After the last move up, the observation shows:

rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 3 step up → (-2,3)
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 3 step up → (-1,3)
rule `stop` 4 step up → (3,3)
wall 3 steps to the right and 3 step up → (3,3)
rule `key` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up → (6,3)
...
rule `ball` 2 steps to the right and 1 step up → (2,1)
Baba's position is rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 1 step down → (-2,-1)

So Baba is at (-2,-1). The ""is"" rule is at (-1,3). To get there, Baba needs to move up to (-2,2), then right to (-1,2), then up to (-1,3). But there's a wall at (3,3), but that's far away. 

Alternatively, from (-2,-1), move up to (-2,0), then right to (-1,0), then up to (-1,1), then up to (-1,2), then up to (-1,3), where the ""is"" rule is. 

Once there, pick up the ""is"" rule and move it to the ball's location at (2,1). 

But moving from (-1,3) to (2,1) requires moving right and down. Each step must be valid. 

Once the ""is"" rule is at (2,1), combine it with the ball's rule to create ""ball is you"". Then the ball becomes movable as the player. Then move the ball to the key at (5,1). 

This seems feasible, but it requires several precise moves. 

The immediate next action should be to move up from (-2,-1) to (-2,0), then right to (-1,0), then up to (-1,1), and so on. However, given the current observation and the need to provide a single action, perhaps the best immediate action is to move up to get closer to the ""is"" rule. 

Alternatively, check if there's a quicker way. Since the key is at (5,1), and Baba is at (-2,-1), moving right three times and down once would get to (1,0), but there's a wall at (3,3) which isn't in the way. Wait, the walls are at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), etc. So from (-2,-1), moving right towards the key is blocked by walls starting at x=3. So need to find a detour. 

Another idea: Use the ball to break the wall. If the ball has a destructive property, but there's no such rule. 

Alternatively, create a rule that makes walls passable. For example, ""wall is key"". But that would require rearranging the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-2,3). To move that rule, need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position (-2,-1), moving up to (-2,0), then up to (-2,1), then up to (-2,2), then up to (-2,3), where the ""wall is stop"" rule is. Then move the rule somewhere else. If I change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is key"", then walls become passable. But the key is already win, so that might not help. 

But if I can pass through walls, then I can go around them. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-2,3).
2. Move the rule to change it to ""wall is ..."", say ""wall is key"".
3. Then move right past the walls.

But this requires multiple actions and might not be possible in one step. 

Given the time constraints and the need to output a single action, the best immediate action is probably to move","
