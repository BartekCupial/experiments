Let's try to figure out how to solve this level. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which in this case is the key. The current rules say ""key is win"", so touching the key would make us win. But there's a bunch of walls blocking the path. The active rule ""wall is stop"" means walls are obstacles we can't pass through. Also, ""baba is you"" means we control Baba.

Looking at the map, there's a wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps up. The key is further right and a bit down. There's a wall in the way. The rules for key, is, win are in a cluster 5,6,7 steps right and 3 up. But how do I get past the walls?

The rules are movable, right? Since ""baba is you"", I can move text blocks unless they're stopped. Wait, the rules that are part of existing rules might be stopped if their property is stop. But ""wall is stop"" is an active rule, so any object that's wall is stopped. The text blocks for the rules might not be walls unless specified. Hmm.

The active rules include ""wall is stop"", so any wall is an immovable object. The other rules like ""key is win"" are text blocks that I can potentially move if they aren't stopped. Let me check the objects. There's a rule `key` at 5 right, 3 up. Rule `is` at 6 right, 3 up. Rule `win` at 7 right, 3 up. These are the parts forming ""key is win"". If I can rearrange these text blocks, I can change the rules.

Wait, the door is at 6 right, 3 down. Not sure if that's relevant yet. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. To get there, the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can push the walls away by changing their properties. For example, if I can make wall not a stop, then I can move through them. But how?

The current active rules are ""wall is stop"" and ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", maybe I can move them. But to do that, I need to edit the existing rules. To edit a rule, I need to move the ""is"" text block between the subject and property. For example, if I take the ""wall"" rule and rearrange it to ""stop is wall"", then ""wall"" would be a stop, but wait, noâ€”wait, the rule is ""wall is stop"", which means that any object named wall has the property stop. If I change it to ""stop is wall"", that would mean that the property stop is assigned to the object stop, which might not help. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule that changes the behavior of wall. For instance, if I can make ""wall is you"", then I could move the walls myself. Or maybe ""stop is key"" so that key is stop, blocking me, which is not helpful. Hmm.

Looking at the rules available: there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 2 up. The rule ""stop is"" is part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can separate those, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block to another position, perhaps making ""stop is key"" or something else. Wait, but the existing ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". So to edit that rule, I need to move one of those components. If I take the ""stop"" text block and move it elsewhere, maybe I can form a new rule like ""stop is [something else]"".

But first, I need to reach those text blocks. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. The wall blocking the path is 2 right and 3 up. Let me visualize the map. Baba is probably starting somewhere, but the exact position isn't given. Let's assume Baba is at a starting point, maybe near the lower left. The walls form a line to the right. The key is past those walls. The rules for key, is, win are above the key. So maybe the path to the key is to the right, but blocked by walls. To get to the key, I need to either move the walls or change their property.

Since ""baba is you"", I can move any text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" property is assigned by ""wall is stop"", so if an object is a wall, it's stopped. The text blocks themselves might not be walls unless specified. So the text blocks for the rules (like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", etc.) are probably not walls unless there's a rule saying so. So I can move them.

The plan: go to the ""wall is stop"" rule and rearrange it to make wall not stop. For example, change it to ""stop is wall"", which would mean that the stop property is assigned to the object named stop. But that might not help. Alternatively, delete the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving its components away. Or create a new rule that says ""wall is you"", allowing me to move the walls.

To do that, I need to take the ""wall"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""you"" text block. The ""you"" text block is at 1 left, 3 down. So perhaps I can create a new rule ""wall is you"" by moving those three text blocks together. Then walls would become movable, and I could push them out of the way.

But how to get to those text blocks? Let's see. The existing ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up (the rule `wall` is 3 left, 2 up; `is` is 2 left, 2 up; `stop` is 1 left, 2 up). The ""you"" text block is at 1 left, 3 down. So to get there, I need to move down from the current position. Wait, but the user hasn't specified Baba's position. Maybe I need to infer based on the objects. Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 5 right, 2 down, and the walls are to the right. So maybe the player is starting to the left of these structures.

Alternatively, let's think of the map layout. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. The wall cluster is at 2 right, 3 up. The rules for key, is, win are above the key. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. So perhaps the player (Baba) is somewhere to the left, needing to move right past the walls to reach the key.

To get to the ""you"" text block at 1 left, 3 down, I need to move left and down. But maybe there's a path. Let's see. The walls at 2 right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, etc., form a vertical line to the right. The key is past those walls. So maybe the player is starting to the left, and can move right, but the walls block the way.

But the text blocks for the rules are above the key. So perhaps the player can go up to those text blocks, rearrange them, then come back down. For example, move up to the ""key is win"" rule, then move the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks to create a new rule.

Wait, the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key makes us win. The problem is the walls blocking the path. So the immediate goal is to reach the key, which is behind walls. To do that, either move the walls or change their property.

If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"", then I could push the walls away. Or make ""wall is you"", allowing me to move them. Let's try that.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: wall at 3 left, 2 up; is at 2 left, 2 up; stop at 1 left, 2 up. To change this rule, I need to move one of these components. For example, take the ""stop"" text block and move it to another position to form a new rule. If I take ""stop"" and pair it with another subject, like ""key is stop"", that would make the key a stop, blocking it. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe create ""stop is you"" so that stop properties are you, allowing movement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""wall is you"" by taking the ""wall"" text block, ""is"" from somewhere, and ""you"" from 1 left, 3 down. Let's see. The ""is"" text blocks are at 6 right, 3 up; 2 left, 2 up; 2 left, 3 down. So perhaps take the ""is"" from 2 left, 3 down (part of the ""baba is you"" rule) and combine it with ""wall"" and ""you"".

But to do that, I need to move those text blocks. Let's say I move down to the ""baba is you"" rule at 3 left, 3 down. The ""is"" there is at 2 left, 3 down, and ""you"" is at 1 left, 3 down. If I take ""wall"" from 3 left, 2 up, move it down to 3 left, 3 down, then place ""is"" next to it, and then ""you"" next to that, forming ""wall is you"". Then wall would become you, meaning I can move the walls.

Once that's done, I can push the walls blocking the path to the key. Then go around them and pick up the key.

So the steps would be:

1. Move from current position to the ""wall is stop"" rule (3 left, 2 up).
2. Take the ""wall"" text block and move it down to the area near ""baba is you"" (3 left, 3 down).
3. Take the ""is"" text block from 2 left, 3 down and place it next to the moved ""wall"".
4. Take the ""you"" text block from 1 left, 3 down and place it next to the ""is"", forming ""wall is you"".
5. Now walls are you, so they can be moved.
6. Move the walls blocking the path to the key.
7. Go to the key and touch it to win.

But the problem is the user hasn't specified Baba's starting position. So I need to infer or assume a path. Alternatively, perhaps the immediate action is to head towards the ""is"" text block that can be used to create the new rule.

Looking at the objects, the ""you"" text block is at 1 left, 3 down. To get there from the wall block at 3 left, 2 up, the direction would be down and left. But maybe there's a path. Alternatively, maybe the player is nearby.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is simpler. Since the key is the win object, and the walls are stop, maybe the player can rearrange the ""key is win"" rule to make Baba the win. For example, if we can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make us win. But how?

To do that, we need to edit the ""key is win"" rule. The ""key"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up; ""is"" at 6 right, 3 up; ""win"" at 7 right, 3 up. If we can move the ""win"" text block to Baba's position, but Baba is ""you"", so maybe ""baba is win"".

But to do that, we need to take the ""win"" from 7 right, 3 up and move it to where ""baba"" is, which is at 3 left, 3 down. Then combine with ""is"" and ""baba"".

But that would require moving multiple blocks. Let's see:

1. Move ""win"" from 7 right, 3 up to 3 left, 3 down (near the ""baba is you"" rule).
2. Take the ""is"" from 2 left, 3 down (part of ""baba is you"") and place it next to ""baba"".
3. Place the moved ""win"" next to ""is"", forming ""baba is win"".

Then, touching Baba (yourself) would make you win. So you could just stand there and win. But that seems too easy. Maybe that's a possible solution.

Alternatively, the key is still at 5 right, 2 down. If you can push the walls out of the way by making them you, then move to the key.

But which solution is more likely? Let's think. Changing ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"" would make you win immediately, but you might need to access the text blocks. The ""win"" text block is above the key, so maybe you can go up there first.

Alternatively, the initial goal is to reach the key, which is a win object. The walls are the main obstacle. So the key approach is to remove the stop property from walls.

But how to do that? Let's focus on making ""wall is you"".

To create ""wall is you"", you need the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""you"" in sequence. The ""you"" is at 1 left, 3 down. The ""is"" can be taken from 2 left, 3 down (part of ""baba is you""). The ""wall"" is at 3 left, 2 up (part of ""wall is stop"").

So the steps would be:

1. Move from current position to the ""wall is stop"" rule area (3 left, 2 up).
2. Take the ""wall"" text block and move it down to the area near ""baba is you"" (3 left, 3 down).
3. Take the ""is"" text block from 2 left, 3 down and place it next to the moved ""wall"".
4. Take the ""you"" text block from 1 left, 3 down and place it next to the ""is"", forming ""wall is you"".
5. Now walls are you, so you can move them.

Then, move the walls blocking the path to the key (at 5 right, 2 down). Once the path is clear, go to the key and touch it to win.

But the problem is navigating to those text blocks. If the player is starting somewhere else, the movement directions need to be calculated. However, since the current observation doesn't specify Baba's position, I have to assume a general path.

Alternatively, the immediate action is to move towards the ""is"" text block needed to create the new rule. For example, moving down to the ""baba is you"" rule area to get the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks.

But without knowing Baba's location, it's tricky. Maybe the best first move is to move down towards the ""you"" text block at 1 left, 3 down, since that's necessary for creating the ""wall is you"" rule.

Alternatively, check if the key is directly accessible. If the path is blocked by walls, but maybe there's a way around. For example, if some walls are not in a straight line. But according to the observation, there are walls at 2 right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, down to 2 steps down. So it's a vertical line of walls to the right, making a barrier. The key is at 5 right, 2 down, which is past those walls. So the only way is to either move the walls or remove their stop property.

So the priority is to create a rule that makes walls movable. To do that, we need ""wall is you"". The components are available: ""wall"" at 3 left, 2 up; ""is"" at 2 left, 3 down; ""you"" at 1 left, 3 down.

The first step is to gather these three text blocks. Let's say the player needs to move from their starting position to the area of the ""wall is stop"" rule, then move the ""wall"" text block down to where the ""baba is you"" rule is. Then bring the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks there to form the new rule.

Assuming the player is near the wall blocks, moving left and down might be necessary. For example, if Baba is to the right of the wall blocks, moving left to reach the ""wall"" text block.

But without knowing the exact position, it's hard to say. However, the immediate action should be to move towards the necessary text blocks. For instance, moving left to reach the ""wall"" text block at 3 left, 2 up, then down to combine with ""is"" and ""you"".

Alternatively, the first action could be to move left to get closer to the ""wall"" text block. Let's say the player is at a position that requires moving left once to reach 3 left, 2 up (the ""wall"" part of ""wall is stop"").

In that case, the chosen action would be LEFT to move left towards the ""wall"" text block.

Let's see. The user has moved left in the previous step, and now the observation has changed. The active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So my goal is to get to the door, which is probably the win condition, but since key is win, maybe I need to pick up the key first?

Looking at the objects now, after moving left, the key is at 6 steps right and 2 down. The door is at 7 right and 3 down. There are walls blocking the path. Wait, the walls are defined as stop, so I can't move through them. But since I'm Baba and baba is you, maybe I can move past them if they're not stop? No, because the rule wall is stop, so walls are stop. So I need to find a way around.

The key is to the right of the current position, but there's a row of walls from 3 right up to 3 right and 3 down. The key is at 6 right, 2 down. So to get there, maybe I need to move right multiple times. But the walls are at 3 right steps up, down, etc. Let me visualize the map.

Current position of Baba: The rules mention rule `baba` is at 2 left and 3 down. So starting position is maybe the origin. Let's assume my position is (0,0). Then:

- The wall at 2 left and 2 up would be at (-2, 2).
- The rule blocks are moving when I moved left. After moving left once, the rules and objects shifted right? Or maybe the movement affects the positions. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing. But the key is now at 6 right, 2 down. So to reach it, I need to move right multiple times.

But there's a wall at 3 right in various positions. For example, wall at 3 right, 3 up; 3 right, 2 up; 3 right, 1 up; 3 right; 3 right, 1 down; 2 steps down. So between my current position (probably at 2 left, 3 down based on the baba rule's position) and the key, there's a gap. Let's see:

If I'm at (2 left, 3 down), moving right would take me to (1 left, 3 down), then (0,3 down), then (1 right, 3 down), etc. But the walls at 3 right in various positions might block the path. Wait, the walls at 3 right are up, 2 up, 1 up, same level, 1 down, 2 down. So to get from my position (assuming baba is at 2 left 3 down) to the key at 6 right 2 down, I need to go right past the walls. But the walls at 3 right are blocking the direct path. So maybe I need to move around them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rules to change something. The key is win, so if I can get the key, maybe touching it makes me win? Or the door is the win condition. Wait, the active rules are key is win, so maybe touching the key makes me win. Or maybe the door is the actual win, but key overrides it. Hmm.

Alternatively, since key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key. Let's see the key's position is at 6 right 2 down. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. Let's check the path:

Current position: 2 left 3 down (baba's rule is there). So moving right once would take me to 1 left 3 down. Then right again to 0,3 down. Then right to 1 right 3 down. Then right to 2 right 3 down. Then right to 3 right 3 down. But there's a wall at 3 right 3 down. So I can't go past that. So need to find another way.

Looking down, the key is at 6 right 2 down. Maybe go down first? From 2 left 3 down, moving down once to 2 left 2 down. Then try to move right. Let's see:

At 2 left 2 down: can I move right? The walls at 3 right in 2 down are present (wall 3 right and 2 down). So moving right from 2 left 2 down would take me to 1 left 2 down, then 0, 1 right, etc., but when I reach 3 right 2 down, there's a wall. So that's a blocker.

Alternatively, move up first. From current position (2 left 3 down), move up to 2 left 2 down. Then right? Same issue. Maybe moving up more. Let's see:

If I move up from 3 down to 2 down, then 1 down, then same level, then 1 up, 2 up, 3 up. At 3 up, there's a wall at 3 right 3 up. So maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the rules. The rule `baba` is at 2 left 3 down. The `is`, `you` are there. So if I can move those to create a new rule, like ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key"", that might help. To do that, I need to move the text blocks 'baba', 'is', 'you' somewhere.

Looking at the objects, after moving left, the rule `baba` is at 2 left 3 down (same as before?), and the `is` and `you` are 1 and 3 steps down. So to create a new rule, say ""baba is win"", I need to move the 'baba' text next to 'is' and then 'win'. The 'win' rule is at 8 right 3 up. That's quite far. Alternatively, maybe 'baba is key' to become the key. But the key is at 6 right 2 down, which is in the opposite direction.

Alternatively, maybe move the 'win' rule closer. The 'win' rule is at 8 right 3 up. If I can move that down and to the left, perhaps next to 'baba' and 'is' to make ""baba is win"". But the problem is that I need to move the text blocks, but they might be stop or not. The rules say that only objects not defined as stop can be moved. Wall is stop, so the rules might be movable unless they have a stop property. Let me check the active rules: wall is stop, but the other rules like 'key is win'â€”is 'key' stop? No, only wall is stop. So the text blocks (rules) can be moved as long as they are not part of a stop rule. So I can move them.

So the plan is: move the 'win' rule to be next to 'baba' and 'is' to create ""baba is win"". Then touching the door (which is win) would make me win. But how to move the 'win' rule?

The 'win' rule is currently at 8 right 3 up. To get it to the position of 'baba' (2 left 3 down), that's a huge distance. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, look for other rules that can be moved to create a different rule.

Alternatively, create ""key is you"", making the key movable. Then pick up the key and use it to unlock the door. But the door is at 7 right 3 down. The key is at 6 right 2 down. So if the key is you, I can push it towards the door. But there are walls in the way. Let's see:

If key is you, then I can move the key. The key is at 6 right 2 down. To get to the door at 7 right 3 down, I need to move right and down. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 right steps. For example, from 6 right 2 down, moving right to 7 right 2 down is possible if there's no wall. But looking at the current walls, at 3 right steps, but the key is further right. Wait, the walls are at 3 right in various positions. So from 6 right 2 down, moving right to 7 right 2 downâ€”no wall there. Then down to 7 right 3 down, which is the door. But the door's position is 7 right 3 down. So if I can move the key there, then since key is win, maybe that's the solution.

But to make key is you, I need to rearrange the existing rules. The original rule is ""key is win"". The text blocks for 'key', 'is', 'win' are at 6 right 3 up, 7 right 3 up, 8 right 3 up. So to create ""key is you"", I need to move 'you' next to 'is' after 'key'. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. So perhaps moving 'you' up to be near the 'key' and 'is' blocks.

Alternatively, since the current rules are key is win, maybe break that rule. If I can move the 'win' block away, then the rule key is win would be inactive. Then create a new rule like key is you or baba is win.

But moving the 'win' block from 8 right 3 up to somewhere else. Let's think: to create ""baba is win"", I need 'baba', 'is', 'win' in sequence. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left 3 down. The 'is' is at 1 left 3 down. The 'win' is at 8 right 3 up. That's a lot away. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, look at the other rules. There's a 'door' at 7 right 3 down. If I can make door is you, then I can move the door. But door's properties aren't defined yet. Alternatively, if door is win, but the active rule is key is win.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe touching the key makes me win. So if I can reach the key, that's the solution. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 right. How to get around them?

Wait, the walls at 3 right are from 3 right 3 up down to 3 right 3 down. So between my current position (assuming around 2 left 3 down) and the key (6 right 2 down), there's a vertical line of walls at 3 right. So to get past them, I need to go around. Maybe move down to avoid the walls.

From current position (2 left 3 down), move down to 2 left 2 down. Then rightwards. The walls at 3 right 2 down are present, so can't go there. Move further down to 2 left 1 down. Then right. Still, walls at 3 right 1 down. Hmm. Maybe move even further down to 2 left same level (3 down-1=2 down?), wait, maybe my coordinate system is off. Let's clarify:

Assuming the initial position is (0,0), and movements affect positions accordingly. But the user's observation lists objects relative to somewhere. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" would be at (2,3). The rule `baba` is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, which would be (-3, -3). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe better to focus on relative positions.

The key is at 6 right 2 down. The door is at 7 right 3 down. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left 3 down. So to get to the key, I need to move right past the walls at 3 right. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules to make the walls not stop, allowing movement through them. For example, if I can change wall is stop to something else, like wall is push or you. But how?

The active rules are wall is stop, key is win, baba is you. So to change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. For example, to make wall is not stop, I could create a new rule like wall is you or wall is move. But to do that, I need to move the 'wall', 'is', and the new property blocks.

The 'wall' rule is at 2 left 2 up. The 'is' is at 1 left 2 up. The 'stop' rule is at 1 left 2 up. Wait, in the current observation, the rule `stop` is at 2 step up. Wait, looking at the objects:

Objects on the map include:
rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up

Wait, in the first observation after moving left, the rules are:

Active rules:
key is win
wall is stop
baba is you

Objects:
rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up

So the 'wall', 'is', 'stop' rules are all at the same position: 1 left 2 up. That means they are stacked. So to create a new rule, I need to move them apart. For example, move the 'stop' block away to modify the wall rule.

If I can move the 'stop' block from 1 left 2 up to another position, then the wall rule would no longer be stop. For instance, if I make wall is you, then I can move through walls.

So the steps could be:

1. Move the 'stop' block away from the wall rule.
2. Move the 'wall' and 'is' blocks with a new property, like 'you'.
3. Then, since walls are no longer stop, I can move through them to reach the key.

But how to do that? Let's see:

The 'wall' rule is at 2 left 2 up, 'is' at 1 left 2 up, 'stop' at 1 left 2 up. So they are on top of each other. To separate them, I need to move one of them. Let's say I move the 'stop' block to the right. For example, move it right once to 0 left 2 up. Now, the wall rule would be ""wall is"" followed by the new position of 'stop'. But since 'stop' is moved, the original rule wall is stop is broken.

Then, I can create a new rule like wall is you by moving 'wall', 'is', and 'you' together. The 'you' rule is at 3 steps down. So I need to move it up to the position near 'wall' and 'is'.

This seems complicated, but possible. Alternatively, maybe a quicker way.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can pick up the key by making it you. So create ""key is you"". The 'key' rule is at 6 right 3 up, 'is' at 7 right 3 up, and 'you' is at 3 steps down. To make ""key is you"", I need to move 'you' up next to 'key' and 'is'.

The 'you' block is at 3 steps down. To get it to 6-7 right 3 up, that's a big distance. But perhaps there's a way to move it step by step.

Alternatively, use the existing 'you' block and move it next to 'key' and 'is'. For example, move the 'you' block up and right. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, since the user moved left initially and the objects shifted, maybe the key is now closer. In the current observation, after moving left, the key is at 6 right 2 down, which might be closer than before.

Wait, in the first move, the user did 'left', which caused all objects to shift right by one? Or maybe the player moved left, and the rest of the level shifted accordingly. This is a bit confusing, but the key point is that after moving left, the key's position is now 6 right 2 down, which is perhaps reachable if we can move around the walls.

Another idea: since Baba is you, maybe you can push objects that are not stop. But wall is stop, so you can't push walls. However, if you can change wall to not stop, then you could push them.

But let's focus on moving the key. If key is you, then I can move the key towards the door. The door is at 7 right 3 down. The key is at 6 right 2 down. So moving the key right once to 7 right 2 down, then down to 7 right 3 down (the door). But to do that, I need to pick up the key by making it you.

To create ""key is you"", I need to move the 'you' block next to 'key' and 'is'. The 'you' block is currently at 3 steps down. Let's see:

From the current observation, the 'you' rule is at 3 steps down (relative to where?). Assuming the player is at 2 left 3 down, the 'you' rule is 3 steps down from there, which would be 2 left 0 down. Wait, this is getting too ambiguous. Maybe better to think in terms of relative movements.

Alternatively, since the 'you' block is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from the 'baba' rule's position. The 'baba' rule is at 2 left 3 down, so 'you' is at 3 left 6 down? Not sure. This coordinate system is tricky without a visual.

Alternatively, prioritize moving the 'you' block closer to the 'key' and 'is' blocks. The 'key' is at 6 right 3 up, 'is' at 7 right 3 up, 'you' at 3 steps down. Maybe move the 'you' block up and right.

To move the 'you' block, I need to walk next to it and then move it in the desired direction. Since baba is you, I can move any object that's not stop. The 'you' block is a text block, so unless it's defined as stop, it's movable. Since wall is stop, but other text blocks like 'is', 'key', 'win', 'baba' are not stop, they can be moved.

So the plan is:

1. Move towards the 'you' block at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down (from the 'baba' rule's position).
2. Once next to it, move it in the desired direction, say right and up to get it near","

2,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. So the goal is usually to reach a WIN object, but in this case, the active rule says ""key is win"", so the key is what we need to get to instead. But how do we get past all the walls?

First, let's look at the map setup. The player is Baba, who is ""YOU"" because of the rule ""baba is you"". The walls are all marked as ""STOP"", so touching them would block movement. The key is at 6 steps right and 2 down, and the win condition is the key itself. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. There's also a door at 7 steps right and 3 down, but I don't know if that's relevant yet.

Looking at the rules, there's ""wall is stop"", so maybe if we can change that rule, we could walk through walls. Also, the key is win, so grabbing it would make us win. But how to get past the walls?

Wait, the player can move text blocks to create or change rules. Let me check where the text blocks are. There's a ""key"" rule at 6 right, 3 up; ""is"" at 7 right, 3 up; ""win"" at 8 right, 3 up. So those form ""key is win"". Also, there's ""wall is stop"" at 2 left and 2 up, with ""is"" and ""stop"" next to it. So maybe if I can move those text blocks, I can replace ""wall is stop"" with something else.

But to move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. The player (Baba) is probably at the starting position. Let me check where Baba is. The rules mention ""rule `baba` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down"", so the ""baba is you"" rule is there. But where is Baba's actual position? The observation doesn't list Baba as an object; maybe he's at the position where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 2 left and 3 down. Let me confirm: the rule `baba` is at 2 left, 3 down. So the player is there.

So the player's current position is 2 left, 3 down. From there, they can move around. The walls are all to the right, so moving right would hit walls. But maybe by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule, we can make walls passable. For example, if we change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", then walls would become controllable. Or maybe change ""stop"" to another property.

Looking at the text blocks: the ""wall is stop"" rule is at 2 left, 2 up, with ""is"" at 1 left, 2 up, and ""stop"" at 2 up (but coordinates are a bit unclear here). Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is separate. The key is at 6 right, 3 up. So the player needs to go right, but the path is blocked by walls.

Wait, the player is at 2 left, 3 down. To get to the key at 6 right, 2 down, they need to move right multiple times. But the walls at 3 right and down steps are stopping them. So perhaps moving the ""stop"" property from walls to something else would allow passage.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is push"", but I don't have a ""push"" text block. Or maybe ""baba is move"", but again, need the text blocks. The available text blocks are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""baba"", ""you"". So possible combinations.

If I can take the ""stop"" text block and move it to another subject, like making ""baba is stop"", then Baba would be stop, which might prevent him from moving. That's bad. Alternatively, swap ""stop"" with another property. For example, if I can make ""wall is baba"", then walls would behave like Baba, which is ""you"", so maybe we can walk through them. But how?

Let me think step by step. The player is at 2 left, 3 down. The ""baba is you"" rule is there. To move a text block, the player needs to be adjacent to it and not blocked by STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step up, but where exactly? The observation lists ""rule `stop` 2 step up"". So the ""stop"" text block is two steps up from the player's position. The player is at 2 left, 3 down. Two steps up would be 2 left, 1 down? Wait, coordinates can be tricky. Let me parse the positions again.

The rule `stop` is described as ""2 step up"". So if the player is at position (0,0) for simplicity, then ""2 step up"" would be (0, 2). But the actual positions are relative. The player's position is where the ""baba"" rule is located: 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. Let's assume the player's position is (2 left, 3 down). Then, the ""stop"" rule is 2 steps up from there, so (2 left, 3 down - 2) = (2 left, 1 down). But the walls are at 3 steps right and various positions. 

The text blocks that can be moved are the ones listed under ""Objects on the map"", including the rules. The player needs to move these rules to create new ones. For example, to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", but we don't have a ""push"" block. Alternatively, change ""stop"" to something else.

The key is at 6 right, 2 down from the player's position (since the key is 5 steps right and 2 steps down from the original position, but I need to check the exact coordinates). Wait, in the first observation, the key was 5 steps right and 3 up, but after moving left, the positions have shifted. Now, the key is at 6 right and 2 down. So from the player's position (2 left, 3 down), moving right 8 steps would get to the key's x-coordinate (since 2 left + 6 right = 4 right), but the player is at 2 left, which is -2 relative to the center, and the key is at +6, so total right movement needed is 8 steps. But the path is blocked by walls starting at 3 right.

So the main obstacle is the walls from 3 right upwards and downwards. To bypass them, perhaps we can change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The original ""wall is stop"" is at 2 left, 2 up. If we can move the ""stop"" text block from there to another part, like attaching it to Baba, making ""baba is stop"", but that would make the player stop, which is bad. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" to ""key"", making ""key is stop"", but the key is the win condition, so that would block us from winning.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is push"", which would let the player push objects, but we don't have a ""push"" block. Alternatively, ""baba is move"", but again, no such block.

Wait, the available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you. So possible new rules could be combinations of these. For example, moving the ""is"" block from 7 right, 3 up (part of ""key is win"") to elsewhere. Or moving the ""win"" block to attach to another subject.

Another idea: Since the key is win, if we can reach the key, we win. But the path is blocked. If we can change the ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", then walls would be controllable. To do that, we need to move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to another rule. For example, take the ""stop"" block and attach it to Baba, making ""baba is stop"", but that's bad. Alternatively, attach it to ""wall"" but that's the original rule. Maybe instead, create a new rule ""baba is stop"" and remove ""wall is stop"". But how?

The player needs to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" block is currently at 2 step up from the player's position. The player is at 2 left, 3 down. So ""2 step up"" would be 2 left, 3 down - 2 = 2 left, 1 down. The player can move up to reach there. Once adjacent to the ""stop"" block, they can pick it up and move it to a new location.

So the sequence would be: move up twice from the player's position (2 left, 3 down) to get to (2 left, 1 down), where the ""stop"" block is. Then, move the ""stop"" block to, say, attach it to ""baba"", making ""baba is stop"". But that would make the player stop, which is not good. Alternatively, attach it to ""wall"" but that's the original rule. Hmm.

Wait, the original ""wall is stop"" is made up of three blocks: ""wall"" at 2 left, 2 up; ""is"" at 1 left, 2 up; ""stop"" at 2 up. So to change this rule, we need to rearrange these blocks. If we remove the ""stop"" from ""wall is stop"" and attach it to another subject, like ""baba"", then we'd have ""baba is stop"", and ""wall is ... [nothing]"". But that might not be valid. Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is stop"" by placing ""baba"", ""is"", and ""stop"" together. But the player would need to carry the ""stop"" block to that location.

So the steps could be:

1. Move from player's position (2 left, 3 down) to the ""stop"" block at (2 left, 1 down). To do that, the player needs to move up twice. But wait, the player's current position is 2 left, 3 down. Moving up once would be 2 left, 2 down. Moving up again to 2 left, 1 down. But are there any walls in the way? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and various positions, but the player is on the left side. Moving up shouldn't hit a wall there.

Once the player is at (2 left, 1 down), adjacent to the ""stop"" block, they can pick it up and move it. Let's say they move the ""stop"" block to the position where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 2 left, 3 steps down. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe from the original position. This is getting confusing with the coordinate system. Maybe it's better to think in terms of relative movements.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""stop"" block, the player can move it to create a new rule like ""baba is stop"", which would make the player stop, which is bad. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, create ""wall is baba"", making walls act like Baba, which is ""you"". So if we can make ""wall is you"", then walking into walls would let us pass through them.

To do that, we need to have the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"". The ""you"" block is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down. The player is at 2 left, 3 down. So the ""you"" block is one step to the right of the player. The ""wall"" block is part of the original ""wall is stop"" rule, at 2 left, 2 up. The ""is"" block is next to ""wall"" and ""stop"".

So the plan is: move the ""you"" block to the ""wall is ..."" rule area. For example, take the ""you"" block (1 left, 3 down) and move it to the position where ""stop"" is, so that we can form ""wall is you"". Let's see:

The original ""wall is stop"" has ""wall"" at 2 left, 2 up; ""is"" at 1 left, 2 up; ""stop"" at 2 up. To change it to ""wall is you"", we need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"". So the player needs to move the ""stop"" block away and place the ""you"" block there.

But how? The player is at 2 left, 3 down. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left, 1 down. The ""you"" block is at 1 left, 3 down. So the player can move right to 1 left, 3 down to get the ""you"" block, then move down to 2 left, 1 down to place it next to ""wall"" and ""is"".

So the steps would be:

1. Move right once to reach the ""you"" block at 1 left, 3 down.
2. Pick up the ""you"" block.
3. Move down two steps to reach 2 left, 1 down (where the ""stop"" block is).
4. Place the ""you"" block next to ""wall"" and ""is"", forming ""wall is you"".

Once that's done, the rule ""wall is you"" takes effect, meaning walls are now ""you"", so the player can walk through them. Then, the player can move right past the walls to reach the key.

But how does the player move these blocks? Each move can take one step in a direction and possibly interact with a text block. For example, moving right to the ""you"" block, then down, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move diagonally, but the allowed actions are only up, down, left, right, or idle.

Another angle: The door is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. If the door is the win condition, but the active rule says key is win, so probably not. But if the door could be made win, that might help. However, the key is already win, so maybe the door is a red herring.

Alternatively, push the key using the ""baba is you"" rule. But the key is not movable unless there's a ""push"" rule. Since the walls are stop, the player can't push anything unless they change a rule.

Back to the main plan: Changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"" by swapping ""stop"" with ""you"". Let's outline the movement:

Player starts at 2 left, 3 down.

1. Move right to 1 left, 3 down (to get the ""you"" block).
2. Move down once to 1 left, 2 down.
3. Move left to 2 left, 2 down. Now adjacent to the ""is"" block of the ""wall is stop"" rule.
4. Move down to 2 left, 1 down (where the ""stop"" block is).
5. Place the ""you"" block next to ""wall"" and ""is"", replacing ""stop"".

But how to physically move the blocks? Each time the player moves, they can carry a block if they are adjacent to it. So, for example, when the player is at the ""you"" block's position (1 left, 3 down), they can pick it up and carry it while moving.

So step-by-step actions:

- Right: move to 1 left, 3 down (carrying ""you"").
- Down: move to 1 left, 2 down (still carrying ""you"").
- Left: move to 2 left, 2 down (adjacent to ""is"" block).
- Down: move to 2 left, 1 down (adjacent to ""stop"" block).
- Now, place the ""you"" block next to ""wall"" and ""is"". The ""wall"" is at 2 left, 2 up. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the player needs to move the ""you"" block to the position where ""stop"" is, so that the new rule is formed.

Alternatively, after moving to 2 left, 1 down (adjacent to ""stop""), the player can drop the ""you"" block there, forming ""wall is you"" because the ""wall"" and ""is"" are already in place. So the new rule would be ""wall is you"", replacing the old ""wall is stop"".

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so the player can walk through them. Then, the player can move right past the walls to reach the key at 6 right, 2 down.

But the player's current position after placing the ""you"" block would be 2 left, 1 down. From there, they need to move right to 3 right, 1 down, which is a wall, but now since wall is you, they can pass through. So moving right through the wall.

Then, continue moving right past the walls at 3 right, and reach the key at 6 right, 2 down.

So the sequence of actions would involve moving right, down, left, down, etc., to rearrange the text blocks.

But the problem is translating this into the specific actions (up, down, left, right, idle) that the player can take.

Given the previous failed attempt where the assistant guessed ""left"" and it failed, maybe the correct approach now is to move the ""you"" block to replace ""stop"".

So step-by-step actions:

1. From initial position (2 left, 3 down), move right once to reach the ""you"" block (1 left, 3 down).
2. Carry the ""you"" block and move down to 1 left, 2 down.
3. Move left to 2 left, 2 down (adjacent to the ""is"" block of ""wall is stop"").
4. Move down to 2 left, 1 down (adjacent to the ""stop"" block).
5. Place the ""you"" block next to ""wall"" and ""is"", forming ""wall is you"".

Each movement is a single step. So the actions would be:

right (to get to ""you"" block),
down,
left,
down,
right (to position next to ""wall"" and ""is""),
and then maybe move to place the block. But the exact sequence might require more precise steps.

However, the system might only allow simple actions like up, down, left, right, or idle. So the assistant needs to output one of these.

But given the complexity, perhaps the immediate action needed is to move towards the ""you"" block to start rearranging the rules. So the first action should be ""right"" to move towards the ""you"" block.

3,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is usually to reach the ""WIN"" object, which is the door in this case. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So right now, if I grab the key, it becomes a win, which means I can carry it to the door. But how do I get past the walls?

Looking at the map, there are walls all around the right side, making it tough to move freely. But maybe I can manipulate the rules. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. The rule ""key is win"" is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move that ""key is win"" text block next to the key, then when I pick up the key, it would become win, allowing me to use it to toggle other things or reach the door. But the problem is that the walls are stop, so I need to find a way to move past them.

Baba is you, so I can move around unless stopped. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. To get there, I need to go right three times from my current position? Wait, but the walls are blocking the right path. Maybe there's a way to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can turn walls into something movable, I could navigate around them.

Looking at the rules: there's a ""wall is stop"" rule at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule somewhere else, like next to a wall, then perhaps the wall's property changes. But how do I move the rules? I need to pick up the ""is"" or ""you"" text blocks to rearrange them.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. So I'm controlled by that. The ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. The ""wall is stop"" is at 3 left, 2 up. To rearrange the ""key is win"" rule, I need to move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks into the correct order. But the key is right below the ""win"" rule. If I move the key to be next to the ""win"" rule, then maybe the rule becomes key is win, which it already is. Hmm, maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, since the key is win, if I pick up the key, it becomes a win, so I can potentially use it to push other objects or to activate the door. But the door is a win, but maybe I need to be a win? Wait, the active rules say key is win, so if I take the key, I become win? Because ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", so if I have the key (which is win), then I am you and the key is win, so maybe I become win? That might be a way to reach the door.

But how to get to the key. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. My current position isn't shown, but looking at the objects, the player (baba) is probably at the position where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 3 left, 3 down. So from there, I need to move right to reach the key. Let's calculate the path. From 3 left, 3 down, moving right three steps would get me to 0, 3 down, but there are walls at 2 right, 3 down (the wall there). So I can't go directly right. Maybe I need to move around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else. If I can make walls not stop, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and break it into parts or replace it. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. To break it, I need to move either ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" away. For example, moving the ""stop"" part elsewhere. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up. So maybe if I move the ""stop"" text block, that would change the rule.

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""wall is you"", which would make walls movable. But to do that, I need to have the ""is"" and ""you"" text blocks. The ""you"" is at 1 left, 3 down. The ""is"" is at 2 left, 3 down. So if I can move those to form ""wall is you"", that could work. Let's see: the current ""wall is stop"" is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move the ""stop"" to another position and replace it with ""you"", then the rule would be wall is you. That would make walls movable.

But how to move those text blocks. The player is at 3 left, 3 down. To get to the ""is"" at 2 left, 3 down, I can move left once. Then pick up the ""is"" and move it to the position where ""stop"" is, which is 1 left, 2 up. But moving left from 3 left, 3 down to 2 left, 3 down (that's a left move). Then, pick up the ""is"" and move it up and left to replace the ""stop"".

But there might be walls in the way. Let me check the map again. The walls are all on the right side. So moving left shouldn't have walls. From 3 left, 3 down, moving left to 2 left, 3 down is possible. Then, pick up the ""is"" and move it to the ""stop"" rule's position. Once that's done, the rule would be ""wall is you"", making walls movable. Then I can walk through them.

Alternatively, once walls are not stop, I can go around them to reach the key. But the key is at 5 right, 2 down, which is to the right. If I can get past the walls on the right by making them movable, then I can go right, collect the key (which is win), and then go to the door.

Another approach: since the key is win, if I can get the key and then reach the door, which is also a win, but maybe I need to be a win to activate the door. Since ""key is win"", if I have the key, then I am you and the key is win, so maybe I become win. Then, stepping on the door (which is also win) would win the level.

So steps could be:

1. Move to the key's location (5 right, 2 down).
2. Pick up the key, which makes me win.
3. Move to the door at 6 right, 3 down.

But the problem is the path is blocked by walls. So I need to either move the walls or find a way around.

Alternatively, use the key to change another rule. For example, if I can make ""door is win"" by rearranging rules, but the door's position is fixed. The existing ""key is win"" is the active rule. If I can replace that rule with ""door is win"", then the door would be the target. But how?

The ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right, 3 up. To change it, I need to move the ""key"", ""is"", or ""win"" text blocks. The ""win"" is at 7 right, 3 up. The ""key"" is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move the ""win"" to the door's position, but that might not help. Alternatively, create a new rule ""door is win"" by moving the necessary blocks.

But the door is at 6 right, 3 down. So to create ""door is win"", I need to have ""door"", ""is"", and ""win"" in that order. The ""door"" object is there, so if I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks next to it, that could work. But that might be complicated.

Another angle: since the key is win, picking it up makes me win. Then, maybe I can push the door or use some other rule. But the door is a separate object. If I'm win, stepping on it would probably win the level.

So, the plan is:

- Move to the key (5 right, 2 down).
- Pick up the key, becoming win.
- Move to the door (6 right, 3 down).

But how to get past the walls on the right. If I can make walls not stop, that would help. So changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"" or something else.

To do that, I need to manipulate the existing ""wall is stop"" rule. The components are at 3 left, 2 up (wall), 1 left, 2 up (stop), and the ""is"" is at 2 left, 2 up.

If I can move the ""stop"" part away, then the rule would break. For example, moving the ""stop"" text block to another location. The ""you"" text block is at 1 left, 3 down. Maybe swap ""stop"" with ""you"".

So, from the player's position at 3 left, 3 down:

1. Move left to 2 left, 3 down (to get to the ""is"" block).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block and move it to somewhere else, maybe next to ""wall"" and ""you"" to form a new rule.
3. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block to a different spot.

Alternatively, move the ""you"" block next to ""wall"" and ""is"" to make ""wall is you"".

Let me think step by step:

Current ""wall is stop"" rule components:
- ""wall"" at 3 left, 2 up
- ""is"" at 2 left, 2 up
- ""stop"" at 1 left, 2 up

To change this to ""wall is you"", I need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"". So move the ""stop"" block away and bring the ""you"" block into place.

Player is at 3 left, 3 down. To reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up, need to move left twice and up once. But there's a wall at 2 right, 3 down? Wait, looking at the map, the walls are on the right side. The player is on the left, so moving left and up should be possible.

So steps to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"":

1. From 3 left, 3 down, move left to 2 left, 3 down (action: left).
2. Then move left again to 1 left, 3 down (another left).
3. Now at 1 left, 3 down, which is where the ""you"" block is. Pick it up (but how? Maybe move up to reach the ""stop"" block? Wait, the ""stop"" is at 1 left, 2 up. So from 1 left, 3 down, move up once to 1 left, 2 up. There's the ""stop"" block. So:

Wait, the player is at 3 left, 3 down. To get to the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up:

- Move left twice: 3 -> 2 -> 1 left.
- Move up once: from 3 down to 2 up.

So positions:

Start at 3 left, 3 down.

Move left to 2 left, 3 down.

Move left to 1 left, 3 down.

Move up to 1 left, 2 up. Here is the ""stop"" block.

Now, if I can pick up the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, then the ""wall is you"" rule can be formed.

But to pick up a block, the player needs to be adjacent to it and not blocked by STOP. Since the player is at 1 left, 2 up, next to the ""stop"" block, and assuming that moving here is allowed (since walls are stop, but the player is Baba, who is you, so maybe can move through unless stopped by STOP properties).

Wait, the player is Baba, and the rules are ""baba is you"" and ""wall is stop"". So as long as the player is not touching a STOP object, they can move. The ""stop"" property is on objects like walls. So moving to 1 left, 2 up, which has a ""stop"" block, but the player is you, so can they move there? Wait, the ""stop"" property is on the object with the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" block itself is a text block, not an object. Wait, maybe the STOP property is on the wall, which has the ""wall is stop"" rule. So the walls are stop, but the text blocks like ""stop"" are movable unless they're part of a rule that makes them stop. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

In Baba Is You, text blocks that are part of active rules can be moved unless the rule makes them stop. For example, if an object is defined as STOP, then you can't move it. But the text blocks themselves (like the word ""STOP"") are objects. So if an object is STOP, you can't move it, but the text blocks that form the rules can be moved unless they're part of a rule that makes them stop.

In this case, the rule is ""wall is stop"", which means walls have the STOP property. The text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" are separate objects. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block, that would break the ""wall is stop"" rule. So the player can move the ""stop"" block unless it's part of a rule that says something like ""text is stop"", which is not the case here.

So, the player can move the ""stop"" block. So from 1 left, 2 up, which has the ""stop"" block, the player can pick it up and move it. Let's say move it down to 1 left, 1 up. Then, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be stop. Then, the player can walk through walls.

Once walls are no longer stop, the player can move around them. Then, go to the key, pick it up (which makes key win, so the player becomes win), and then go to the door.

So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" block and move it elsewhere.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so the player can move through them.
4. Move right to reach the key, pick it up.
5. Move to the door and win.

But the problem is the player's current position isn't specified in the latest observation. The last observation after the previous actions shows the player might have moved right once, but not sure. However, in the current observation, the objects are listed with positions relative to where? Probably the player is at a certain position, but it's not explicitly stated. This makes it a bit harder, but perhaps we can infer.

Alternatively, maybe the easiest way is to move right towards the key, assuming that after changing the rules, the walls are no longer stop. But how to ensure that.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""stop"" block first. Let's see the current rules and objects again.

The ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the left and 2 step up. The player is probably at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. So from there:

To reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up:

- Move left twice (from 3 to 1 left).
- Move up once (from 3 down to 2 up).

So the path is left, left, up.

Once there, pick up the ""stop"" block and move it, say, one step down to 1 left, 1 up. This would break the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls not stop.

Then, the player can move right past the walls on the right side.

Then, move right to the key's location at 5 right, 2 down. But from the player's new position (after moving left twice and up once), which would be 1 left, 2 up, moving right three times would get to 4 left, 2 up. Then down to 4 left, 3 down (which is the player's original position?), but not sure.

Alternatively, after making walls movable, the player can go around the wall on the right. For example, move right past the walls by going around them since they're no longer stop.

Once the key is picked up, the player becomes win, so stepping on the door (which is win) would complete the level.

So the action sequence would involve moving to the ""stop"" block, moving it, then moving right to get the key, then to the door.

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation shows that after previous actions, the player might have moved right once, leading to the new positions. The active rules are the same: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. The objects' positions have shifted slightly, with the key's rule moving right each time.

In the latest observation, the ""key"" rule is at 6 steps right, 3 up, ""is"" at 7, 3 up, ""win"" at 8, 3 up. The walls are all on the right side. The player's position is likely where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 2 step left and 3 steps down. So the player is at 2 left, 3 down.

Looking at the map, to reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up, the player needs to move left once (from 2 left to 1 left) and up once (from 3 down to 2 up). That would place the player adjacent to the ""stop"" block. Then, the action would be to move left or up, but perhaps the correct action is to move left to get next to the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, the player might need to move up first. Let's see:

Current player position: baba's rule is at 2 left, 3 down.

To reach 1 left, 2 up:

- Move left once: 2 left -> 1 left.
- Move up once: 3 down -> 2 up.

So the action would be left then up, but since the system asks for one action at a time, the first step is to move left.

So the next action should be left to get to the ""stop"" block's position.

Let's try to figure this out. The goal is to get to the door, which is probably the 'WIN' condition. But in the active rules, 'key is win'â€”so maybe picking up the key makes it the win object. However, in the current observation, the key's position hasn't changed yet.

Looking at the map, the player is probably at the starting point, which might be near the left side. The walls are all to the right, so moving left might not help. Wait, the 'baba is you' rule means that whatever Baba is touching or is on, can be manipulated. The door is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. But there are walls blocking the path to the right. 

The key is at 6 steps right and 2 down. To get there, maybe move right twice to reach the key's X-coordinate, but there's a wall at 3 steps right on the same row. Hmm. Wait, the player's position isn't specified, but the rules and objects are placed relative to somewhere. Let me assume the player is at the position of 'baba' rule, which is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So from there, moving right would get closer to the key. But there are walls blocking the direct path. 

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules. The 'key is win' rule is fixed, but if I can change that, perhaps make 'door is win' instead. To do that, I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'door' and 'is'. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 3 up. The 'door' is at 7 right, 3 down. So moving the 'win' block down and left would connect it to 'door' and 'is'. But how to move those blocks? The player (Baba) must be able to move them, but they can't be STOP. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step up, which is probably a wall. So moving down towards the door area. 

Wait, the 'baba' rule is at 2 left, 3 down. If I move down from there, maybe I can reach the 'is' and 'you' rules at 1 left, 3 down. Then, if I can get the 'win' block to be next to 'door' and 'is', that would change the rule. But how to move the 'win' block which is at 8 right, 3 up. That's far away. Maybe first move towards the key, then use the key to unlock something, but I don't know if there's a lock. 

Alternatively, the key is at 6 right, 2 down. If I can get there, maybe pick it up? But in Baba Is You, you have to be a 'YOU' object to pick up items. Since 'baba is you', that's possible. So moving right from the baba's position (2 left, 3 down) to reach the key. Let's see: from 2 left, moving right 4 steps would get to 2 right. But there are walls at 3 right on the same row (walls at 3 right, 2 up, 1 up, etc.), so maybe the path is blocked. 

Wait, the player's position is probably where the 'baba' rule is, which is 2 left and 3 down. So to move right, they would have to go past walls. But the walls are all to the right. So maybe the initial move is to go down to avoid the walls. Let's say moving down once from 3 down to 4 down. Then check if there are walls there. The walls at 2 right and 3 steps down are there, but maybe moving down past that. 

Alternatively, perhaps rearrange the rules first. The 'key is win' rule is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move 'key' to be next to 'door' and 'is', but that's a long way. Maybe another approach: change 'baba' to 'win' so that touching the door makes Baba win. To do that, I need to create a rule like 'baba is win'. The existing rules are 'baba is you', 'key is win', 'wall is stop'. So if I can move the 'you' block next to 'baba' and 'win', that would replace the rule. 

The 'you' block is at 1 left, 3 down. So from the baba's position (2 left, 3 down), moving left once to 1 left, 3 down, which is the 'you' block. Then, if I can move the 'win' block from 8 right, 3 up to be next to 'baba' and 'you', but that's a distance. Alternatively, maybe move the 'is' block from 2 left, 3 down to connect 'baba', 'is', 'win'. Wait, the 'is' block is at 2 left, 3 down, same as the baba's rule. So if I can pick up the 'is' block and move it next to 'baba', 'you', and 'win'. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline steps:

1. Move to the 'is' block at 2 left, 3 down (same as baba's rule position). Since baba is you, you can pick up the 'is' block.
2. Move down to get past the walls on the right.
3. Find a path to the 'win' block at 8 right, 3 up, but that's far away.
Alternatively, go to the 'door' at 7 right, 3 down and try to make a rule that door is win.

Alternatively, use the key. If I can get the key (at 6 right, 2 down), then maybe move it to be next to 'win' and 'is'. But again, the path is blocked by walls.

Another idea: since 'key is win', picking up the key makes it a win object. So if I can reach the key and then go to the door, maybe holding the key makes the door the win condition. Wait, noâ€”the active rule is 'key is win', so having the key would make any key a win, but the door is separate. Maybe the solution is to take the key and then use it to override another rule.

Alternatively, change the 'key is win' rule to 'door is win'. To do that, move the 'win' text block next to 'door' and 'is'. The 'win' is at 8 right, 3 up. The 'door' is at 7 right, 3 down. So moving the 'win' block down and left. But how?

The player (Baba) is at 2 left, 3 down. To reach the 'win' block at 8 right, 3 up, they need to move right 10 steps and up 3, but there are walls in the way. The walls at 3 right on various rows block the path. So maybe the key is the way to go. Pick up the key, then use it to move other blocks? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is at 6 right, 2 down. From the baba's position (2 left, 3 down), moving right 4 steps and down 1 step would get to 6 right, 2 down (the key's position). But the path is blocked by walls at 3 right on the same row as the baba. So how to get around that? Maybe move down to avoid the walls. For example, move down once to 4 down, then right to 3 right, but there's a wall there at 3 right, 2 step up, which is part of the wall structure.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules first. Since 'baba is you', you can move the 'is' block. The 'is' block is at 2 left, 3 down (same as baba's rule). If I move that 'is' block to connect 'baba', 'win', and create a new rule 'baba is win'. But how? The current 'baba is you' rule is at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, noâ€”the 'baba' rule is at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down? Wait, looking back at the observation:

Objects on the map include:
rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down

So the 'baba' rule is 3 steps left and 3 down from the player's current position? Or is the player at the origin? This is confusing without a visual map. Maybe I need to assume the player's position is where the 'baba' rule is located, which is 3 left and 3 down. So to move right, the player would be moving towards the center.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the position of the Baba character, which is not explicitly listed but can be inferred from the rules. This is getting too ambiguous. Let me try to focus on the rules and objects.

The key is at 6 right, 3 up. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 3 up. So if I can move the 'win' rule to the door's position (7 right, 3 down), that would make 'door is win'. To do that, I need to move the 'win' block down and left. To move a text block, I have to be a 'YOU' object (which Baba is). So the steps would be:

1. Move towards the 'win' block at 8 right, 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 right on various rows.
2. Alternatively, go to the 'key' at 6 right, 2 down, pick it up, and use it to move other blocks. But I'm not sure if keys can be used to move blocks in this game.
3. Another approach: create a new rule 'door is win' by moving 'is', 'door', and 'win' together. The 'is' block is at 7 right, 3 up (rule `is` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up?), wait noâ€”the 'is' block next to 'key' is at 7 right, 3 up. The 'door' is at 7 right, 3 down. So if I can get 'door', 'is', and 'win' adjacent, that would work. 

The 'win' block is at 8 right, 3 up. To move it down to 7 right, 3 down (door's position), I need to carry it past the walls. But the walls at 3 right block the path. Maybe by rearranging other blocks first.

Alternatively, use the 'key is win' rule to make the key the win object. So if I pick up the key and then go to the door, maybe that's sufficient. But the door is a 'door' object; the active rule is 'key is win', so having the key would make any key win, but the door isn't a key. Unless the rule can be changed.

This is really challenging. Let me think again. The current active rules are:

- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

The goal is probably to reach the door, but since 'key is win', maybe getting the key makes you win. But the key is at 6 right, 2 down. To get there, need to navigate past walls. 

Looking at the map layout:

From the player's position (assuming at baba's rule position: 3 left, 3 down), moving right:

- Right 1: wall
- Right 2: wall
- Right 3: multiple walls upwards and downwards
- The key is at right 6, down 2. So from the player's position, moving right 4 steps and down 1 step would reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls at right 3 on the same row.

So maybe the solution is to move down first to avoid the walls. For example:

1. Move down from the player's position (3 left, 3 down) to 3 left, 4 down.
2. Then move right to 4 left, 4 down (but this might not help).
Wait, this is getting too confusing without knowing the exact grid. Alternatively, focus on moving the 'win' rule to the door.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 3 up. The door is at 7 right, 3 down. To move the 'win' block down and left, I need to carry it past the walls. But how? The player (Baba) is at 3 left, 3 down. To reach the 'win' block at 8 right, 3 up, they need to move right 11 steps and up 3, which is blocked by walls at 3 right on various rows.

Another angle: since 'baba is you', maybe you can push blocks that are not stop. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step up, which is probably a wall. So blocks that are not stop can be moved. The 'key', 'is', 'win', 'baba', 'you' rules are not stop, so they can be moved.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the 'key' at 6 right, 2 down.
2. Pick up the key and use it to move other blocks, but I'm not sure how.
3. Alternatively, move the 'win' block to the door's location by pushing it with the key or other means.

Alternatively, create a new rule 'door is win' by moving 'is', 'door', and 'win' together. The 'is' block is at 7 right, 3 up (adjacent to 'key'). The 'win' is at 8 right, 3 up. So if I move the 'win' block left to 7 right, then place the 'door' next to it with 'is', that would make 'door is win'. But the 'door' is at 7 right, 3 down. So I need to move the 'win' block down to 3 down, which is a big distance.

This is really tough. Maybe the solution is to move the 'is' block next to 'baba', 'you', and 'win' to create 'baba is win'. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The 'you' block is at 1 left, 3 down. The 'is' block is at 2 left, 3 down. So if I move the 'is' block from 2 left, 3 down to between 'baba' and 'you', connecting them with 'is', that would create 'baba is you', which is already there. To change it to 'baba is win', I need to replace 'you' with 'win'. So move the 'is' block next to 'baba', then add 'win' next to it. But where is the 'win' block? It's at 8 right, 3 up. So this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, pick up the 'win' block and move it to the door's position. But again, the path is blocked.

Wait, the door is at 7 right, 3 down. The 'win' block is at 8 right, 3 up. If I could move the 'win' block down and left, placing it at 7 right, 3 down next to the door and an 'is' block. The 'is' block is at 7 right, 3 up (adjacent to the key). So maybe move the 'is' block down to 7 right, 3 down, then place 'win' there. But how?

This is taking too long. Maybe the correct action is to move right towards the key, hoping to pick it up and then use it to override the win condition. So the next action would be 'right' to move closer to the key.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is to reach the door, which is probably acting as the win object. But the key is also set as win, so maybe I need to interact with the key first? Let me check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects, I see a key located at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. The door is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. There are walls all around the right side, making it hard to move freely. Since wall is stop, I can't pass through them unless I change their property. But right now, baba is you, so I can move around, but I can't go through the walls.

The key is the current win object, so picking it up should let me win. But to get to the key, I need to navigate past the walls. The walls are to the right, so maybe I need to go left or up? Let me see the positions again.

The key is at 5 right, 2 down. The player (Baba) is probably at a starting position, maybe near the left side. The rules for baba, is, and you are at 3 left, 3 steps down. So maybe I need to move those rules to change something. For example, if I can make Baba be win, then touching the door would make me win. Or maybe make the door a YOU so I can move into it.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, so touching the key would win. But the key is blocked by walls. Let me see the path. From the key's position (5 right, 2 down), there are walls to the right (since walls are at 2, 3, 5 right, etc.), so I can't go right. Maybe I need to move up or down.

But the player's position isn't explicitly listed here. Wait, the rules for baba, is, and you are at 3 left, 3 steps down. So maybe that's where I am. So I'm at 3 left, 3 down. Let me visualize the map.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up; then more walls going down to 2 right, 3 down. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. So the path to the key is blocked by walls on the right. To get to the key, I need to move right past the walls, but they're all marked as stop. Unless I can change the wall's property.

Since baba is you, I can move the text blocks. The rule 'wall is stop' is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can move that 'stop' text block somewhere else, maybe I can change what wall does. For example, if I make wall be push or something, but I don't have a push rule. Alternatively, make stop be something else.

But how do I get to the text blocks? The rules are scattered. The 'baba is you' rule is at 3 left, 3 down. Maybe I can move that. If I can make 'baba' be 'win', then touching the door (or even myself) would make me win. Let's see: to create 'baba is win', I need the 'is' and 'win' text blocks. The 'is' is at 2 left, 3 down, and 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up. That's a bit far.

Alternatively, maybe take the 'key is win' rule and move it somewhere else. If I remove the 'key is win' rule, then the default win might be the door. But I'm not sure. Or maybe make the door be 'win' by moving the 'win' text block to the door's position.

Wait, the door is at 6 right, 3 down. The 'win' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. If I can move the 'win' block to the door's location, then the door becomes win. But how to get there? The path to 7 right, 3 up is blocked by walls. The walls are at 2 right upwards, so maybe moving up from my current position (3 left, 3 down) is challenging.

Alternatively, focus on getting to the key. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. From my current position (assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule's location: 3 left, 3 down), I need to move right towards the key. But there are walls at 2 right, so maybe I can't go directly right. Maybe I need to move up first to avoid the walls.

Let me think step by step. My current position is probably at the 'baba' rule block: 3 left, 3 down. To move towards the key, which is 5 right, 2 down, I need to go right twice and down once. But the walls at 2 right block the path. The walls at 2 right go from 3 up to 3 down. So from my position (3 left, 3 down), moving right once gets me to 2 left, 3 down. But that's not helpful. Maybe I need to move up first.

If I move up from 3 left, 3 down to 3 left, 2 down, then 3 left, 1 down, etc., but there's a wall at 2 step left and 2 step up (rule 'wall' at 2 left, 2 up). Wait, the rules for wall is stop are at 2 left, 2 up. So if I try to move into that area, it's a stop? But I'm Baba, and wall is stop, so I can't move through walls. But the rule 'wall is stop' is a text block; if I can move that, maybe I can change the rule.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can make 'baba is stop', then the walls wouldn't stop me. But how? To do that, I need the 'baba', 'is', and 'stop' text blocks. The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 3 down. The 'is' is next to it at 2 left, 3 down. The 'stop' is at 1 left, 2 up. That's a bit far.

Alternatively, focus on the key. Since key is win, maybe I can grab the key and move it to the door? But keys in Baba Is You can usually be pushed if the rule allows. But currently, there's no 'push' rule. Unless I can make the key not a stop. But wall is stop, but key's property isn't defined as stop. Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So key is win, which means touching it makes you win. So if I can reach the key, I win. But the path is blocked by walls on the right.

The walls on the right are at 2 right, from 3 up down to 3 down. So from the key's position (5 right, 2 down), there's a wall at 2 right, 3 down. Wait, no, the walls at 2 right are from 3 up down to 3 down. So the key is at 5 right, which is further to the right than the walls. So maybe the walls are blocking the path from left to right near the top, but the key is on the lower right.

Wait, maybe I need to go around the walls. From my current position (3 left, 3 down), moving right towards the key would require passing through 2 left, 3 down, then 1 left, 3 down, etc., but the walls are at 2 right, not left. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the directions. Let me clarify the coordinate system.

Assuming that the player's position is relative, but in the observations, the objects have positions like ""2 steps to the right and 3 steps up"" from some reference point. But without knowing the exact starting point, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the map is structured with Baba starting near the left side, and the walls form a barrier on the right.

Given that the key is at 5 right, 2 down, and the door is at 6 right, 3 down, and there are walls from 2 right upwards, perhaps the solution involves moving the 'win' rule to the door. Since key is currently win, touching the key wins. But to get to the key, I need to avoid the walls. Alternatively, make the door the win by moving the 'win' text block there.

The 'win' rule is at 7 right, 3 up. To move it to the door at 6 right, 3 down, I would need to carry the 'win' text block. But I can only move objects that aren't stop. The 'win' block itself is an object; is it stop? The active rules are wall is stop, but 'win' isn't defined as stop. So maybe I can pick up the 'win' block and move it.

But how do I reach the 'win' block at 7 right, 3 up? There's a wall at 2 right, 3 up (rule 'wall' is at 3 left, 2 step up). Wait, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 step up. So if I try to move up from my position (3 left, 3 down) to 3 left, 2 down, then 3 left, 1 down, then 3 left, 0 down (which might be the starting point), then move right towards the 'win' block at 7 right, 3 up. But the path is blocked by walls on the right side.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing rules to manipulate other objects. For example, if I can make 'baba' be 'push', then I could push walls. But there's no push rule currently. Alternatively, make 'is' a different property.

Wait, another approach: since the key is win, maybe I don't need to touch it. If I can make the key not a win by moving the 'key is win' rule. The 'key is win' rule is at 5 right, 3 up. If I can move that rule away, then maybe the default win is the door. But how to move that rule? I need to carry the 'key', 'is', and 'win' blocks. The 'is' is at 6 right, 3 up, next to the 'key' rule. The 'win' is at 7 right, 3 up. So to create a new rule, say 'baba is win', I need to move the 'baba' rule (at 3 left, 3 down), 'is' (at 2 left, 3 down), and 'win' (at 7 right, 3 up). That's a long distance.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'you' rule. The 'you' rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 steps down from the 'is' rule. So at 2 left, 3 down. If I can make 'baba' be 'you', but 'baba' is already part of the 'baba is you' rule. Wait, the existing rule is 'baba is you', so baba is you. So maybe that's already taken care of.

Another thought: the door is at 6 right, 3 down. If I can make the door 'you', then I could move into it. To do that, I need to create a 'door is you' rule. The 'you' block is at 3 steps down (from the 'is' rule at 1 left, 3 down). So the 'you' block is at 1 left, 3 down. To make 'door is you', I need to move the 'door' object (which is the door itself), 'is', and 'you' together. But the door is at 6 right, 3 down. That's quite far.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move the 'key is win' rule to the door's position. So take the 'key' block (at 5 right, 3 up), 'is' (6 right, 3 up), and 'win' (7 right, 3 up), and rearrange them to form 'door is win'. That way, touching the door would make me win. To do that, I need to carry those blocks to the door's location (6 right, 3 down). But moving them down from 3 up to 3 down and right from 7 to 6 would require navigating around the walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way. Since I'm Baba and I can move, maybe I can push the key past the walls. But the key isn't defined as pushable unless there's a 'push' rule. Currently, the only rules are wall is stop, key is win, and baba is you. So the key can't be pushed. Unless I change a rule to make it pushable.

Alternatively, make 'key' not a stop. Since wall is stop, but key isn't. So maybe I can move past the key. Wait, the key is at 5 right, 2 down. If I can move right past it, but there's a wall at 2 right, 3 down. Wait, the walls on the right are at 2 right, from 3 up to 3 down. So the key is at 5 right, which is beyond those walls. So maybe the path to the key is clear to the right, but blocked by the walls near the top.

Wait, perhaps the layout is such that the right side has a horizontal wall from 2 right, 3 up down to 2 right, 3 down. So to get to the key at 5 right, 2 down, I need to go around that wall. But how? The wall is at 2 right, so from 3 left, I need to go around to the left or right. But the wall spans from 3 up to 3 down at 2 right, meaning that moving right past 2 right is blocked vertically there. But the key is at 5 right, which is further to the right, so maybe the wall only blocks the passage from left to right at the top, but not the lower part.

Wait, this is getting confusing without a visual. Let me try to outline the positions:

- Wall rules: at 2 left, 2 up (wall is stop), and others forming a vertical wall at 2 right from 3 up to 3 down.

- Key is at 5 right, 2 down.

- Door is at 6 right, 3 down.

- The 'key is win' rule is at 5 right, 3 up.

So perhaps the path from the player's position (assuming near the 'baba' rule at 3 left, 3 down) to the key requires moving right past 2 right, but the wall at 2 right from 3 up to 3 down blocks that. So to get around, maybe move down below the wall.

If the wall at 2 right is only from 3 up to 3 down vertically, then below that (like 2 right, 4 down) there's no wall. So maybe the player can move down from 3 down to 4 down, then right past 2 right.

Let me think step by step:

1. From current position (3 left, 3 down), move down to 3 left, 4 down.

2. Then move right to 2 left, 4 down.

3. Continue right to 1 left, 4 down.

4. Then right to 0 left (center), 4 down.

5. Now, move right past 2 right. Since the wall is only from 3 up to 3 down at 2 right, moving right from 0 left, 4 down to 2 right, 4 down should be possible.

6. Once past 2 right, move right to 5 right, 4 down, then down to 5 right, 2 down (key's position).

7. Pick up the key, which is win, so touching it would make me win.

But wait, the key is at 5 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move right past 2 right, which is allowed since the wall is only blocking the vertical passage from 3 up to 3 down at 2 right. So moving horizontally below that should be free.

So the steps would be:

- Down from 3 down to 4 down.

- Right multiple times to 2 right, 4 down.

- Down to 2 right, 2 down.

- Right to 5 right, 2 down.

- Grab the key.

But how to execute this in the game? The actions are up, down, left, right, idle.

Assuming the player's current position is at the 'baba' rule block (3 left, 3 down), the first action would be to move down.

So the sequence would be: down, down, right, right, right, down, right, right, right, down, left? Wait, maybe I'm getting the directions mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move down once to get past the wall's vertical blocking area. Let me try to map it out:

- Current position: 3 left, 3 down.

- Move down once: 3 left, 4 down.

- Move right: 2 left, 4 down.

- Move right again: 1 left, 4 down.

- Move right: 0 left (center), 4 down.

- Now, move right past 2 right: 2 right, 4 down.

- Then move down to 2 right, 3 down (which is where the wall ends), then down to 2 right, 2 down.

- Move right to 3 right, 2 down.

- Continue right to 4 right, 2 down.

- Right to 5 right, 2 down (key's position).

- Pick up the key (though in the game, you just need to move to the key since it's win).

But in the game, touching the key would make you win. So the actions needed are the path to the key.

However, the previous attempts by the assistant were left and right, but the game kept failing. Maybe the correct path is different.

Alternatively, the solution might involve rearranging the rules. For example, making 'baba' 'win' so that touching the door wins. To do that, create 'baba is win' by moving the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks.

The 'baba' rule is at 3 left, 3 down.

The 'is' rule is at 2 left, 3 down.","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. Let me start by understanding the current situation based on the observation provided.

First, the active rules are:
- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

So, the goal is to get the key, because key is win. But wait, normally the goal is to reach a door or something labeled win, but here the rule says key is win, so grabbing the key would make it the win condition.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down from the player's current position. There are several walls around, some labeled as stop, which means I can't move through them. Also, there's a door at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. But since the key is the win now, I need to focus on getting to the key.

But how do I get past the walls? The walls are positioned such that there's a line of them to the right and some above and below. The player (Baba) is likely somewhere near the left side because the rules like 'baba is you' are to the left of the key area. The key is surrounded by walls on the right, so maybe I need to move the 'wall is stop' rule out of the way or change the rules to bypass the walls.

The rules are scattered around. The 'key is win' rule is 5 steps right and 3 up. The 'is' and 'win' rules are further to the right. To the left, there's a 'wall is stop' rule and 'is' and 'stop' rules. Maybe I can pick up the 'wall' rule and move it to somewhere else, thereby changing its property.

But wait, the player can only move objects that aren't stopped. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. However, the text blocks (like 'wall', 'is', 'you') might be movable if they aren't part of a 'stop' rule. Let me check the active rules again. 'wall is stop' means that any object labeled wall cannot be moved. So the wall objects themselves are stopped, but the text blocks like 'wall' that define the rule might be movable if they aren't part of a stop rule.

Wait, the rules are formed by text blocks. So for example, the 'wall is stop' rule is made up of the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop' arranged horizontally. To change this rule, I need to move these text blocks to form a new rule, like 'stop is nothing' or something else.

But in the current observation, the 'wall is stop' rule is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. The 'is' next to it is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up, and 'stop' is at 1 step left and 2 steps up. So if I can move these text blocks, I could potentially create a different rule. For example, moving the 'stop' text block to another position to make a rule like 'stop is push' or 'wall is you', which might allow movement through walls.

Alternatively, since the player is Baba, and 'baba is you', maybe I can combine text blocks to make Baba have other properties. For instance, if I can create a 'baba is win' rule, then reaching Baba himself would be the win condition. But how?

Let me look at the position of the 'baba' rule. There's a rule 'baba', 'is', 'you' at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So the 'baba' text block is there. If I can move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is', I could form 'baba is win', making Baba the win object. Then, moving to where Baba is (which is the player's position) would win the level. But is that possible?

Alternatively, the key is currently the win object. So if I can reach the key, that would win. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. But the path is blocked by walls. To the right of the key, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, but the key is at 5 right, 2 down. Wait, let me parse the positions correctly.

Wait, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are relative to the player. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means from the player's position, there's a wall two steps right and three up. Similarly, the 'baba' rule is 3 steps left and 3 down, so the player is likely at position (0,0), and the 'baba' rule is at (-3, -3).

The key is at (5, -2) relative to the player. The door is at (6, -3). There's a wall at (2, -3), (2, -2), (2, -1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2). So the path to the key is blocked by a wall at (2, 0), which is two steps right and straight ahead. The key is five steps right and two down, so the player would need to go right past the walls.

But the wall at (2,0) is a stop, so can't move through. So how to get around it? Maybe by changing the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move the 'wall' text block to another position, then walls would no longer be stop. For example, if I create a 'wall is push' rule, then maybe I can push the walls out of the way.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a 'wall' rule at 3 left, 2 up, which is part of 'wall is stop'. The 'is' and 'stop' are adjacent. If I can move the 'wall' text block elsewhere, perhaps next to 'is' and another property, like 'push', then I could create a new rule.

But where is the 'push' text block? I don't see it in the current objects. The available rules are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you. So maybe I need to use existing text blocks to form a new rule. For example, taking the 'wall' text block and moving it next to 'is' and 'push'... but there's no 'push' block here. Hmm.

Alternatively, if I can make the 'stop' rule into something else. The current 'stop' rule is part of 'wall is stop'. If I can remove the 'stop' from that rule and add it to another, perhaps making 'stop is nothing', which would remove the stop property from walls.

But to do that, I need to move the 'stop' text block. However, the 'stop' here is part of the 'wall is stop' rule. Maybe I can break that rule by moving the 'stop' block away. Let's see: the 'wall is stop' rule is composed of 'wall' at (-3, 2), 'is' at (-2, 2), 'stop' at (-1, 2). If I move the 'stop' block to another position, say next to 'is' and another word, like 'push', but there's no 'push' available. Alternatively, move 'stop' to form a new rule with other texts.

Looking at other text blocks: there's a 'win' at (7,3), 'key' at (6,3), etc. Maybe if I can make 'stop' part of a different rule, like 'stop is you', but that might not help. Alternatively, 'stop is win'â€”but that's risky.

Wait, the player is Baba, and 'baba is you'. If I can make 'baba is stop', then the player would be stop and can't move. That's bad. So need to avoid that.

Alternatively, create a 'you is win' rule. But there's no 'you' text block nearby except in the 'baba is you' rule. The 'you' is at (-1, 3) steps down. So if I can move the 'you' block next to 'is' and 'win', then 'you is win' would make the player (since you is Baba) the win object. Then, just staying in place would win. But how to do that.

The 'you' block is currently part of the 'baba is you' rule at (-3, -3): 'baba' at (-3, -3), 'is' at (-2, -3), 'you' at (-1, -3). To create 'you is win', I need to move 'you' to be next to 'is' and 'win'. The 'win' is at (7, 3). So the distance is quite far. The player would need to move right and up, but there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe rearrange the text blocks near the player. The 'wall is stop' rule is to the left, maybe moving those blocks to form a new rule. For example, take 'wall' from (-3,2), 'is' from (-2,2), and 'push'... but there's no push. Alternatively, 'wall is you'â€”but then walls would be you, which might let the player move through them, but since the player is you, that could be possible.

Wait, if I make 'wall is you', then walls would be you, meaning the player can move through them. But how to create that rule. The current 'wall is stop' rule is at (-3,2), (-2,2), (-1,2). If I can move the 'wall' block from (-3,2) to somewhere else, say next to 'is' and 'you'.

The 'you' block is at (-1, -3) in the 'baba is you' rule. So maybe move the 'wall' block to the right and down, placing it next to 'is' (which is at various positions) and 'you'. For example, take the 'wall' block at (-3,2) and move it to, say, (0,0) where the player is, but that's blocked by walls. Alternatively, move it to the area near the 'you' block.

But the player's movement is restricted by the walls. Let's see: the player is likely at (0,0). To move right, there are walls at (2,0), (2,1), etc. So moving right directly is blocked. But maybe by changing the rules, the walls become passable.

Alternatively, use the key to win. The key is at (5,-2). To get there, the player needs to move right five steps and down two. But the path is blocked by walls. So perhaps push the walls out of the way by changing their rule.

If I can make 'wall is push', then maybe the player can push the walls. But how to create that rule. Let's see: the current 'wall is stop' rule's 'stop' block is at (-1,2). If I can move that 'stop' block to form a 'push' rule. But there's no 'push' block. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

Wait, the 'key' is at (6,3), 'is' at (7,3), 'win' at (8,3). So if I can move the 'stop' block from (-1,2) to be next to 'is' and 'key', forming 'stop is key'? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, 'stop is win'â€”but that would make stop objects be win, which might not help.

Alternatively, take the 'wall' block from (-3,2) and move it to the area near the 'key' and 'win' blocks to form 'wall is win', but that would make walls the win condition, which is bad.

Hmm. Another approach: since the key is the win, maybe I don't need to move past the walls but instead change the 'wall is stop' rule to something else so that the walls don't block movement.

If I can create a 'wall is you' rule, then walls would be you, meaning the player can walk through them. To do that, I need to form the rule 'wall is you' using the available text blocks.

The 'wall' text block is at (-3,2), 'is' is at (-2,2), and 'you' is at (-1,-3). So the challenge is to move the 'you' block next to 'is' and 'wall'. The distance between (-1,-3) and (-3,2) is quite large. The player would need to move left and up, but the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' blocks. There's an 'is' at (1,2) (from 'stop is 2 step up'), but I'm not sure. Wait, the 'rule `stop` 2 step up' might be a single text block labeled 'stop' two steps up. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `wall` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 1 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step up

So these are individual text blocks? Or are they part of a horizontal rule? Probably horizontal, forming ""wall is stop"".

So the 'wall' is at (-2,2), 'is' at (-1,2), 'stop' at (0,2). Wait, the first three objects under ""Active rules"" are likely the components of ""wall is stop"": 'wall' at 2 left and 2 up, 'is' at 1 left and 2 up, 'stop' at 0 left and 2 up.

Similarly, ""rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up"" would be the 'key' text block at (5,3), then 'is' at (6,3), then 'win' at (7,3), forming ""key is win"".

So to create a new rule, say ""wall is you"", I need to have 'wall', 'is', 'you' in a horizontal line. The 'you' is part of the ""baba is you"" rule at (-3,-3), (-2,-3), (-1,-3).

So the plan is: move the 'you' block from (-1,-3) to be next to 'is' (which is at (-1,2) in the ""wall is stop"" rule) and 'wall' (at (-2,2)). But how to move the 'you' block there.

The player needs to navigate to where the 'you' block is, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down from the player's position. But moving left and down would require passing through walls or finding a path.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' blocks. There's another 'is' at (2 step left and 2 step up) and another at (1 step left and 3 steps down). Maybe combine them.

Wait, the 'rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down' is part of the ""baba is you"" rule, next to 'baba' and 'you'.

So the 'you' block is at (-1,-3). To move it to be next to 'wall' (-2,2) and 'is' (-1,2), the player would need to move left from (-1,-3) up to (-1,2), but there are walls in the way. The path from (-1,-3) to (-1,2) is blocked by walls at (2 steps right and varying down positions), but actually, the walls are to the right of the player. The player is at (0,0), so left is negative steps.

Wait, maybe the player's position is the origin, and all other positions are relative. So the 'you' block is at (-3,-3), 'baba' at (-3,-3), 'is' at (-2,-3), 'you' at (-1,-3). To get to the 'you' block, the player needs to move left 3 steps and down 3 steps, but that's through open space, not sure if there are walls there.

Looking at the objects, the walls are mainly to the right. For example, walls at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3), and (3,-3). So to the left of the player, there's mostly open space except for the 'baba is you' rule blocks.

So the player can move left and down towards the 'you' block. Once there, they can pick up the 'you' block and move it to form the 'wall is you' rule.

Let's break it down:

1. Move left from the player's position (0,0) to reach the 'you' block at (-1,-3). The path is left 3 steps and down 3 steps. But are there any walls in the way?

Looking at the map, the walls are all to the right (positive x direction). To the left (negative x), there are no walls mentioned, except possibly the 'baba is you' rule blocks. So moving left should be possible.

So the player needs to move left 3 steps to reach x=-3, then down 3 steps to y=-3. But wait, the 'baba is you' rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down from the player. So the 'baba' block is at (-3, -3), 'is' at (-2, -3), 'you' at (-1, -3). So moving left 3 steps from (0,0) lands at (-3,0), then down 3 steps to (-3, -3), which is where the 'baba' block is. But to get to the 'you' block, the player needs to be at (-1, -3).

So the path would be:

- Move left 3 times: left, left, left â†’ position (-3, 0)
- Then move down 3 times: down, down, down â†’ position (-3, -3)
- But at (-3, -3) is the 'baba' block. To get to 'you' at (-1, -3), move right 2 steps from (-3, -3) â†’ (-1, -3).

But moving right from (-3, -3) requires passing through (-2, -3) and (-1, -3). Are there any walls there? Looking at the objects, the only walls are to the right of the player (positive x direction). So moving left and then down and right should be possible.

Once at (-1, -3), the 'you' block is there. The player can pick it up and move it to form the '","

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is probably to get to the door, but the active rules say ""key is win,"" so maybe grabbing the key makes something a win? Or maybe the door is the win, but I need to change the rules to allow that.

First, let's look at the current setup. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, as Baba, I can move unless there's a wall. The key is marked as win, which might mean picking it up makes it the win object. The door is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down. There's a wall blocking that path directly.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 5 steps right and 2 down. To reach it, I might need to move down from my current position. But let's check the map layout. From the observations, it seems there are walls forming a barrier. The walls are two steps to the right in various directions. The key is below those walls, so maybe I need to move down and get the key first.

But how do I get past the walls? Since ""wall is stop,"" and I'm Baba (you), I can't move through walls. So I need to either destroy the walls or change the rules. Right now, the rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. Maybe I can create a new rule that changes ""wall"" from stop to something else, like push or maybe even you. If I can move the wall rules, I could bypass the walls.

Looking at the text blocks on the map, the rules for wall are at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. The ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks are there. So if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule apart, maybe I can replace it with a different property. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then maybe walls can be moved out of the way. Alternatively, if I can make ""stop is wall"" into something else, that could help.

To do that, I need to gather the text blocks. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" and ""you"" blocks are there. If I can move those, I could create a new rule. Let's see: the key is at 5 right, 2 down. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. The wall blocking the door is 2 steps right and 3 down.

So, maybe the plan is: move down to get the key first, then use the key to change a rule. But the key is win, so picking it up might do something. Wait, in Baba Is You, when you touch an object that's defined as win, you win. But here, the active rule is key is win, so touching the key should make me win. But in the observations, the door is still there. Maybe the key being win overrides the door? Or perhaps I need to interact with the door after getting the key.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the actual win, but the rule says key is win. So maybe I need to change the rule to door is win instead. But how? To do that, I need to move the existing ""key is win"" rule apart and create a new ""door is win"" rule.

Let me map out the positions. The key is at 5 right, 3 up. The ""win"" rule is at 7 right, 3 up. So to create ""door is win,"" I need to move the ""win"" block next to the door and the ""is"" block. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 3 up. Wait, the ""is"" block is 6 steps right and 3 up, same as the key's position? No, the key is at 5 right, 3 up. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 3 up. So perhaps I can move the ""win"" block (7 right, 3 up) next to the door (6 right, 3 down) by moving down and left.

But how do I move the text blocks? The player (Baba) is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So the player is at (3 left, 3 down). The door is at 6 right, 3 down. There's a wall at 2 right, 3 down. So to get to the door, I need to go right past the wall, but wall is stop. So unless I change the wall's rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule apart. The ""wall is stop"" is composed of ""wall"" at 3 left, 2 up, ""is"" at 2 left, 2 up, and ""stop"" at 1 left, 2 up. If I can separate these, then I can create a new rule. For example, if I make ""wall is you,"" then I could walk through walls. But to do that, I need to move the existing ""stop"" block away.

Let's think step by step. The player is at (3 left, 3 down). The ""baba is you"" rule is there. The ""is"" and ""you"" blocks are at 2 left, 3 down and 1 left, 3 down. So to create a new rule, say ""wall is push,"" I need the ""wall"" text block, an ""is,"" and a ""push."" The ""wall"" block is at 3 left, 2 up. The ""is"" block is elsewhere. The ""push"" block isn't present, but maybe I can use another property. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing blocks.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe picking it up makes me win immediately. Let's check the key's position: 5 right, 2 down. The player is at 3 left, 3 down. So to reach the key, need to move right and down. But the path might be blocked. Let's see: from the player's position (3 left, 3 down), moving right would go towards the walls. There's a wall at 2 right, 3 down. So moving right once gets to 2 right, 3 down (wall), then can't go further. So to get to the key at 5 right, 2 down, need to move right, but the walls are in the way.

So perhaps the key is out of reach unless we change the wall rules. Therefore, the priority is to change the wall from stop to something else. Let's focus on that.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made of three blocks: ""wall"" at 3 left, 2 up; ""is"" at 2 left, 2 up; ""stop"" at 1 left, 2 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these blocks. For example, moving the ""stop"" block away. If I can move the ""stop"" block, then the ""wall is stop"" rule is inactive, and walls might no longer be stop.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? The player is at 3 left, 3 down. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. The player needs to move towards that. Let's calculate the direction. The player is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up from the ""stop"" block. So moving right twice and up once would reach the ""stop"" block. But along the way, there might be walls.

From player's position (3 left, 3 down):

1. Move right once to 2 left, 3 down (there's a wall here).
2. Can't move right further. So need to move up first?

Wait, maybe the player's position is actually at the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So the player's location is at that coordinate. The other objects' positions are relative to the player? Or is the map laid out in a grid where the player is at a certain point, and the objects are positioned relative to that?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map. The player (Baba) is at the ""baba"" rule's position: 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So if we consider that as the origin (0,0), then other positions are relative. For example:

- Wall at 2 steps right and 3 up would be at (2, 3).
- Rule `key` at 5 steps right and 3 up: (5, 3).
- The ""is"" block at 6 right and 3 up: (6, 3).
- The ""win"" block at 7 right and 3 up: (7, 3).
- The ""wall"" rule's ""wall"" block is at 3 left and 2 up: (-3, 2).
- The ""is"" block for wall is at 2 left and 2 up: (-2, 2).
- The ""stop"" block is at 1 left and 2 up: (-1, 2).
- The player's position is at (-3, -3) [since 3 left is -3, 3 down is -3].

So the map extends from left to right and up to down. The door is at (6, -3). The walls are blocking the path to the door. The key is at (5, -2). To get the key, the player needs to move right and down, but there's a wall at (2, -3).

So the player is at (-3, -3). To reach the key at (5, -2), the player needs to move right 8 steps and up 1 step. But along the way, there are walls. For example, moving right to (2, -3) is a wall. So that's blocked. Moving up first might help.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move around the walls. Let's see the layout:

- From (-3, -3), moving up to (-3, -2) is possible? There's a wall at (2, -3) but not sure about other positions.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. For example:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up: (2, 3)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up: (2, 2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up: (2, 1)
- wall 2 steps to the right: (2, 0)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down: (2, -1)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (2, -2)
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down: (2, -3)

So the right side (positive x-axis) has a wall from y=3 down to y=-3, starting at x=2. The left side has the ""wall is stop"" rule at x=-3, y=2; x=-2, y=2; x=-1, y=2.

The player is at (-3, -3). To move towards the key at (5, -2), they need to go around the right wall. But the right wall is solid from x=2 across all y. So the only way is to go around the left side, but the left side has the rule blocks. Maybe the player can move left past the rule blocks to rearrange them.

The rule blocks for ""wall is stop"" are at (-3, 2), (-2, 2), (-1, 2). The ""baba is you"" rule is at (-3, -3), (-2, -3), (-1, -3). The ""key is win"" rule is at (5,3), (6,3), (7,3).

So the player is at (-3, -3). To reach the ""stop"" block at (-1, 2), they need to move up to (-3, -2), (-3, -1), (-3, 0), (-3, 1), (-3, 2), then right to (-2, 2), then right to (-1, 2). But moving up from (-3, -3) to (-3, 2) requires passing through y=-2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Are there any walls in that path?

Looking at the wall objects, the walls on the left are at x=-3, y=2 (part of the ""wall is stop"" rule), but other positions on the left side don't have walls. The walls on the right side are from x=2, y=3 down to y=-3. So moving up the left side should be possible unless there are walls. Since the only walls on the left are part of the rule blocks, which are movable.

So the player can move up along the left edge. Let's plan the path:

1. From (-3, -3) move up to (-3, -2) â€“ no wall there.
2. Continue up to (-3, -1), (-3, 0), (-3, 1), (-3, 2).
3. Then move right to (-2, 2), then right to (-1, 2) to reach the ""stop"" block.
4. Once the ""stop"" block is moved, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, making walls not stop. Then the player can move through walls.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" block of the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""is"" block is at (-2, 2). If the player can move that, they can break the rule.

But to move any block, the player must be adjacent to it and not be stopped by a ""STOP"" property. Since the player is Baba, and currently, ""wall is stop,"" but the player is not a wall, so they can move unless blocked by a wall. Since the player is on (-3, -3), which is not a wall, they can move freely in the grid unless there's a wall in the way.

So the steps could be:

- Move up from (-3, -3) to (-3, 2).
- Move right to (-2, 2), then right to (-1, 2) to grab the ""stop"" block.
- Move the ""stop"" block away, say down to (-1, -3).
- This breaks the ""wall is stop"" rule, so walls are no longer stop.
- Then, the player can move through walls and go right to the key and door.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". But to do that, the player needs to rearrange the text blocks.

Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe picking it up makes the key the win object, so touching it would win the game. Let's check the key's position: (5, -2). The player needs to get there. But the path is blocked by walls at x=2. Unless we change the wall rules.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the real win, but the rule says key is win. So to change that, the player needs to create a ""door is win"" rule. To do that, they need the ""door"" text block, an ""is"", and a ""win"". The ""win"" block is at (7, 3). The ""door"" is at (6, -3). The ""is"" block is at (6, 3) or others.

So maybe the player can move the ""win"" block from (7,3) to next to the door (6, -3) and use an ""is"" block. But the distance is huge. The player is at (-3, -3), so moving all the way to (7,3) and then down to (6,-3) is impossible without changing the movement rules.

This seems too complicated. Let's focus back on changing the wall rules.

Once the ""stop"" block is moved, walls are no longer stop. Then the player can move through them. So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""stop"" block at (-1, 2).
2. Move it down to, say, (-1, -3).
3. Now walls are not stop, so the player can walk through them.
4. Then proceed right to the key at (5, -2), pick it up (which makes key win, so touching it would win?), but the door is at (6, -3). Alternatively, create a ""door is win"" rule.

But how to pick up the key? In Baba Is You, touching an object that's defined as win makes you win. Since ""key is win,"" touching the key should make you win. So maybe the solution is to reach the key and touch it.

But the path to the key is blocked by walls. So after making walls passable, the player can go right through the walls to the key.

Alternatively, if the player can move the key to the door, but that's probably not possible.

Another possibility: The door is at (6, -3), which is one step right from (5, -3). The key is at (5, -2). So if the player gets the key and then moves to (5, -3), then right to (6, -3) (the door), but there's a wall at (2, -3). Wait, no, if walls are no longer stop, then the player can walk through them. So from (5, -3), moving right past x=2 would be possible because walls are not stop anymore.

So steps:

1. Move up to (-1, 2) and move the ""stop"" block away.
2. Now walls are passable.
3. Move right from (-3, -3) towards (5, -2), passing through walls.
4. Reach the key at (5, -2), touch it (win).
5. Alternatively, create a ""door is win"" rule and touch the door.

But touching the key should suffice if ""key is win.""

However, in the current observation, after moving the ""stop"" block, the player would need to navigate through the right wall area, which is now passable. So from (5, -2), moving right to (6, -2), (7, -2), etc., until reaching (6, -3), the door.

But the key is at (5, -2), so moving down from there to (5, -3) and then right to (6, -3) would reach the door.

Alternatively, since the key is win, just touching it would make the player win. So the main goal is to reach the key.

But how to get past the walls. Let's outline the movement:

Player starts at (-3, -3).

To reach the key at (5, -2):

Path: go up along the left, move right past the rule blocks","

8,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the WIN object, which is the key in this case. But since ""key is win"", touching the key makes us win. However, there are walls that are stop, so I have to navigate around them.

Looking at the objects on the map, I'm probably positioned somewhere, maybe at the starting point. The key is located at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. There's a door at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. But walls are blocking the direct path. The walls are arranged in a grid to the right, so moving straight right towards the key might not work.

The key insight here is that since ""baba is you"", I can manipulate the rules by moving text blocks. The rules are scattered around. For example, there are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"" rules. If I can move the ""win"" text next to ""baba"" or another object, I might be able to change what's win. Wait, the door is the usual win, but here key is win. Alternatively, maybe I can change ""key is win"" to something else, like making the door the win by rearranging the rules.

Looking at the rule pieces: there's a ""win"" rule at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. If I can move that ""win"" text next to the door, which is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down, maybe that would make the door the win. But how do I get there? The path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""key is win"" rule apart and create a new rule like ""door is win"". But I need the necessary ""is"" and ""door"" text blocks.

Wait, the door is present on the map. The rule `win` is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up, and the door is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I can move the ""win"" text down to the door's position by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" together. But the problem is moving through the walls. Since walls are stop, I can't push them, but I can move past them if I'm not stopped. Wait, noâ€”objects with ""stop"" can't be moved. So I need to find a path around the walls.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can move the text blocks that form the rules. For example, the ""key is win"" rule is made up of the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks. If I can separate them, I can change the rule. But to do that, I need to move each text block individually. Let's see:

The ""key is win"" rule is at 5,3 (key), 6,3 (is), 7,3 (win). If I can move the ""win"" block to somewhere else, maybe next to the door. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" block, which is part of the active rule. Since the rule is still active, moving the ""win"" block would break the ""key is win"" rule, making ""key"" not necessarily win anymore. That might be useful. Then, if I can create a new rule like ""door is win"", that would let me go to the door instead.

But how to get to the door? The door is at 6,3 down. From the current position, which I'm assuming is at 2 right (since the walls start at 2 right), I need to move right towards the key. However, the walls at 2 steps right and up/down make it tricky. Maybe I can move the ""baba"" rule to become something else. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba (myself) would win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" text next to ""baba"".

Looking at the rules: there's a ""baba"" rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, along with ""is"" and ""you"". So the rule ""baba is you"" is there. If I can move the ""win"" text next to ""baba"" and ""is"", then create ""baba is win"". But again, the path might be blocked.

Alternatively, the key is win, so if I can reach the key, that's the goal. But the key is at 5 right, 2 down. The path to there is blocked by walls at 2 right, 2 up; 2 right, 1 up; etc. So maybe I need to move the walls by rearranging their rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 2 up. If I can break that rule, maybe walls aren't stop anymore. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text away from ""wall"". The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 2 up. So the rule is ""wall is stop"", made by the ""wall"" block at 3 left, 2 up, ""is"" at 2 left, 2 up, and ""stop"" at 1 left, 2 up.

If I can move the ""stop"" block away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would be broken, making walls not stop. Then I could pass through them. That seems like a viable path. So the steps would be: move the ""stop"" block to somewhere else, then go around the walls to the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can move any object that's not stop. Wait, the rules say that objects defined as stop can't be moved. So if walls are stop, then the wall blocks can't be moved. But the text blocks (rules) might not be stop unless defined. Let me check the active rules: ""wall is stop"", so the wall objects are stop, meaning I can't move them. But the text blocks like ""is"", ""win"", etc., are they stop? No, unless there's a rule saying so. The only stop is the wall objects. So I can move the text blocks because they're not stop.

So the ""stop"" text block is at 1 left, 2 up. To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move either the ""wall"", ""is"", or ""stop"" part away. Let's say I move the ""stop"" block. If I can move it to a different position, then the rule ""wall is stop"" is no longer connected, so walls are no longer stop. That would allow me to walk through walls.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" text block away. Where can I move it? Let's see the map. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. There's space around. Maybe move it down or right. If I move it down, perhaps to where the ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down. But need to see the path.

Alternatively, after moving ""stop"", go around the walls to the key. But how to get to the ""stop"" block? My position isn't clear, but assuming I'm starting at a position where I can reach the ""stop"" block by moving left and up. From the current observations, the ""stop"" block is 1 step left and 2 steps up from the wall at 3 left, 2 up. So maybe the player is near there.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to first move the ""stop"" block to another location. For example, move it 1 step down to 1 left, 3 up. Then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, walls are no longer stop. Then I can walk through them and reach the key.

But how to move the ""stop"" block? The action would be to move left (to get to the ""stop"" block's position) then move down or right. Let's think step by step.

Current position: Not specified, but the walls are at 2 right, so maybe I'm at 1 right? Or perhaps at the position of the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 3 down. So if I'm at that position, I can move the ""baba"" text blocks. But the ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down. So maybe I'm adjacent to those.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to move the ""win"" rule to the door. The ""win"" block is at 7 right, 3 up. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. To move the ""win"" block, I need to pick it up and carry it down. But the path is blocked by walls. If walls are not stop anymore after moving ""stop"", then it's possible. But this requires a two-step process: first remove ""stop"" to make walls passable, then move ""win"" to door.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can just reach the key. But the path is blocked. Let's check the key's location: 5 right, 2 down. From where? If I'm at 2 right, I need to move right three times, but there are walls at 2 right, 2 up; 2 right, 1 up; etc. So moving right directly is blocked. But if I can move the walls by changing their rules, that would help.

So the key steps are:

1. Break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block.
2. Now walls are passable.
3. Move around the walls to reach the key.
4. Touch the key to win.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""door is win"" by moving ""win"" next to the door.

But let's focus on step 1 first. How to move the ""stop"" block. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. To get there, I need to move left from my current position. Assuming I'm at 2 right (since the walls start at 2 right), moving left once would get me to 1 right. Then from there, move up two steps to reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up. Wait, directions are a bit confusing. The coordinates are relative. For example, ""1 step to the left and 2 step up"" means from the current position, move left once and up twice.

But without knowing the exact starting position, it's a bit tricky. Maybe the assistant should assume a starting position, like the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 3 left, 3 down. Then to reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up, the movement would be right twice, up three times. But that's a long path.

Alternatively, perhaps the assistant should look for the nearest movable text block. The ""stop"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. If the player can get there by moving left and up, then move the ""stop"" block. For example, move left twice and up three times, then move the ""stop"" block down or right.

But the actions are single steps. So each action is one direction: up, down, left, right, or idle.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move the ""stop"" block to the right, making the rule ""wall is [nothing]"", thus breaking it. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the position of the ""stop"" block.
2. Move the ""stop"" block to the right, say to where the ""you"" rule is at 1 left, 3 down.

But how to do that with single steps. Let's break it down.

First, navigate to the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up. Assuming the player is at 3 left, 3 down (Baba's rule position), moving right twice and up three times would get there. But each action is a single step. So:

Right, right, up, up, up.

Once at the ""stop"" block, the next action would be to move the block. Since ""stop"" is a text block, and it's not defined as stop (because the rule ""wall is stop"" is separate), the player can move it. So action: right (to position the ""stop"" block), then maybe move it down or right.

Wait, once you're adjacent to the ""stop"" block, you can push it in a direction. So if the player is to the left of the ""stop"" block, they can move right to take the block, then move further right or down.

Alternatively, the exact movement depends on the game's mechanics. In Baba Is You, you can move a text block by moving into it in the direction you want to push it. So if the player is to the left of the ""stop"" block, moving right would push the block right.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move from the player's position to the left of the ""stop"" block.
2. Push the ""stop"" block to the right.

Assuming the player is at 0,0 (just an assumption), the ""stop"" block is at (-1, 1). To get there, move left once, up once. Then push right to move the ""stop"" block to (0,1).

Once the ""stop"" block is moved, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, so walls are no longer stop. Then the player can walk through walls.

Then, the player can move right past the walls to reach the key. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. So from the starting position, move right multiple times, down as needed, avoiding walls (which are now passable).

Alternatively, after removing ""stop"", create a new rule ""door is win"" by moving the ""win"" block next to the door. The door is at 6 right, 3 down. The ""win"" block is at 7 right, 3 up. So need to move the ""win"" block down to the door's position. That would require a lot of steps, but possible.

But considering the previous actions the assistant took were left and right, maybe the correct move now is to continue moving in a direction that leads towards the key or the ""stop"" block.

Looking at the latest observation, after previous actions, the key is still at 5 right, 3 up's key position. The walls are still there. So the immediate action should be to try to move towards the ""stop"" block to break the rule.

But given the previous failures, perhaps the assistant is getting stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct action now is to move right towards the key, but the path is blocked. So instead, the assistant needs to find a way to move the ""stop"" block.

In the current observation, the ""stop"" block is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps up. Assuming the player is at a position adjacent to it, the action would be to move right to push the ""stop"" block. But without knowing the exact position, it's hard. Maybe the correct action is to move right to get to the ""stop"" block's location and then push it.

Alternatively, the assistant might need to try moving in a direction that leads towards rearranging the rules. Given the previous actions of left and right, maybe the correct next move is down to reach the ""you"" rule and combine it with ""win"" and ""baba"" to create a new rule.

But this is speculative. Given the time constraints, the best guess is to continue moving right towards the key's area, hoping to find a way around the walls after rearranging the rules. Alternatively, move down towards the door and see if creating a ""door is win"" rule is possible.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe the player can push the key towards themselves. But keys are movable unless stopped. If walls are stop, but if we can remove that rule, then the key can be moved. However, the key is at 5 right, 2 down. To push it, the player would need to be adjacent and move in the direction opposite to where they want to push it.

But without knowing the player's exact position, it's challenging. Maybe the assistant should try moving down to get to the lower part of the map where the door is, and attempt to create a ""door is win"" rule by moving the ""win"" block there.

In the current observation, the ""win"" block is at 7 steps right and 3 steps up. The door is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. So the ""win"" block is above the door. If the player can move the ""win"" block down three steps and right one step, that would place it next to the door, making ""door is win"".

To do that, the player would need to move the ""win"" block down and right. But this requires navigating around the walls, which are currently stop. So again, the first step is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Given all this, the most critical step now is to break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" block. Assuming the player can reach the ""stop"" block, the next action should be to move it.

But based on the previous failed actions, maybe the assistant is not properly calculating the path. Perhaps the correct action now is to move down towards the ""you"" rule and combine it with ""baba"" and ""win"" to create a new rule.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the player can just move right towards it, assuming they can find a path after moving the ""stop"" block.

Given the uncertainty, the safest action at this point, considering the previous attempts, is to continue moving right towards the key's area, hoping to eventually maneuver around the walls after breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to reach the door, which is usually a win condition, but in this level, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"". So the door might not be the target anymore. Instead, getting the key and declaring it as win is probably necessary.

Looking at the map, I see the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down from my current position. But there are walls blocking the path. The walls are ""STOP"", which means I can't move through them unless I change the rules. Since ""baba is you"" means I can move the text blocks, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to create a path.

The key is win, so once I grab the key, I should make sure that ""key is win"" is active. Right now, the key is part of the rule ""key is win"" which is up above. But the walls are making it hard to get there. Maybe I need to move the ""win"" text block next to the key so that when I pick up the key, it becomes the win condition. Wait, but how do I move the text blocks?

I'm Baba, so I can move the text blocks that aren't stopped. The ""stop"" property is on the wall, so the text blocks like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", etc., should be movable. The current rule ""key is win"" is at 5 right, 3 up. The key itself is at 4 right, 2 down. So maybe I need to move the ""win"" rule down to be next to the key. That way, when I pick up the key, it becomes the win condition. But how do I move the ""win"" block?

First, I need to navigate to the ""win"" rule. It's 5 steps right and 3 steps up from my current position. But there's a wall at 1 right, 3 up. So I can't go that way directly. Maybe I need to move other text blocks out of the way. Let's see, the ""is"" block is at 5 right, 3 up next to ""win"". If I can move the ""win"" block down, perhaps by rearranging the ""key is win"" rule. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba a win. Since ""baba is you"", if I can make ""you is win"", then Baba (me) would be win. But how? The existing rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", ""baba is you"". The text blocks available are ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"", ""win"", etc., scattered around.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 4 left, 3 down, and ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 down, and ""rule `you`"" at 2 left, 3 down. So if I can move these to form ""baba is win"" or ""you is win"", that might work. However, the walls are blocking movement. Let's check the positions again.

My current position is probably at 1 right (since the walls start at 1 right). The key is at 4 right, 2 down. The door is at 5 right, 3 down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 left, 3 down, which is to my left. To get to that, I need to move left, but there's a wall at 1 right and 3 up, but maybe I can go around.

Wait, maybe I should first focus on getting the key. Since the key is win, but the door's position is 5 right, 3 down. If I can reach the key and then make sure that grabbing it makes me win, perhaps by moving the ""win"" rule next to the key. But how?

Alternatively, if I can turn myself into a win by redefining the rules. For example, if I can create a rule ""baba is win"", then I can just reach the door or stay in place and win. But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule and ""win"" rule together with ""is"".

Looking at the available rules: ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 left, 3 down, ""rule `is`"" at 3 left, 3 down, and ""rule `you`"" at 2 left, 3 down. So if I can move these to form ""baba is win"", that would work. The ""win"" rule is currently at 6 right, 3 up. That's far away. Maybe I need to move the existing ""win"" rule down to where the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules are.

But to move any of these rules, I have to move them one step at a time, possibly by walking into them since I'm ""you"". So maybe I need to move myself to the position of the ""win"" rule and then push it down. Let's see:

The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. To get there, I need to go right 5 times (since my current position is 1 right), but there are walls at 1 right, 3 up, etc. Wait, the walls are at 1 right and 3 step up, 2 right and 3 up, etc. So moving right from 1 right to 2 right is possible? Let me check the objects:

There's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, etc. So the path to the ""win"" rule is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to rearrange the ""key is win"" rule first. The ""key is win"" is made up of ""key"" at 4 right, 3 up, ""is"" at 5 right, 3 up, and ""win"" at 6 right, 3 up. If I can break this rule apart, I can move the ""win"" block elsewhere.

To break the rule, I need to move either ""key"", ""is"", or ""win"" away. For example, if I move the ""win"" block down to where the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules are, then I can form a new rule ""baba is win"". Let's try that.

First, move right from my current position (1 right) to 2 right. There's a wall at 2 right and 3 up, but I'm at 1 right, 3 step up? Wait, the current position isn't specified explicitly, but based on the objects, maybe I'm at the starting point. Let me assume I'm at the position of ""rule `you`"" or somewhere else. This is a bit confusing without the exact grid layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the ""win"" rule down to the area with the ""baba"" and ""is"" rules. To do that, I need to navigate to the ""win"" rule at 6 right, 3 up, but the path is blocked by walls. Maybe I can move the ""is"" block first. The ""is"" block is at 5 right, 3 up. If I move it down to, say, 5 right, 2 up, then the ""win"" block at 6 right, 3 up can be moved left to 5 right, 3 up, forming ""is win"" next to the key. Wait, but the key is at 4 right, 3 up. So ""key is win"" would become ""key win"" if the ""is"" is moved.

Alternatively, if I can get the ""win"" block next to ""baba"", then forming ""baba is win"" would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block left past the walls. Let's think step by step.

1. Current active rules: key is win, wall is stop, baba is you.
2. Goal: Make myself win. Either by getting the key (since key is win) or changing the rules to baba is win.
3. The door is at 5 right, 3 down, but it's behind a wall (wall at 1 right, 3 steps down? Not sure). But maybe the door isn't needed if I can change the win condition.
4. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move right and down, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 2 right, 3 up is a wall. So moving up from my current position (assuming I'm at 1 right) is blocked. Maybe I need to go around.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me parse the objects again:

- Wall at 2 steps right and 3 step up.
- Wall at 3 steps right and 3 step up, etc.
- So the upper right area is blocked by walls. The key is at 4 right, 2 down, which is below me. Maybe I need to go down to reach the key.

But how do I move through the grid? Let's assume my current position is at the starting point, perhaps where the ""rule `you`"" is located, which is 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. Wait, no, the ""rule `you`"" is at 3 steps down. Maybe the player's position is separate from the rules and objects. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at a specific location, and the actions are relative. Since the previous actions were left and right, maybe the player is moving horizontally. Let me try to visualize the grid based on the latest observation.

In the latest observation, the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""rule `is`"" is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 steps left and 3 steps down.

If I'm supposed to be Baba, my position might be at the same location as the ""baba"" text block, which is 4 left and 3 down. But that's a rule, not my position. Maybe the player starts at a default position, like the bottom-left corner.

This is tricky without seeing the actual grid. But given the actions taken before (left, right, idle), perhaps the solution involves moving the ""win"" rule next to the key by rearranging the ""key is win"" rule.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule at 6 right, 3 up.
2. Push the ""win"" rule down to 5 right, 3 up (displacing the ""is"" block).
3. Then move the ""win"" block further down to 4 right, 3 up, next to the key.
4. Now, the rule would be ""key win"", but we need ""key is win"". So maybe move the ""is"" block from 5 right, 3 up to 4 right, 3 up, making it ""key is win"" again but with ""win"" next to the key.

Alternatively, create a new rule ""baba is win"" by moving the ""baba"" rule (4 left, 3 down) to the right, then add ""is"" and ""win"" next to it.

To do that:

1. Move right from the ""baba"" rule's position (4 left, 3 down) to 3 left, 3 down.
2. Then move right again to 2 left, 3 down (where ""is"" is), but ""is"" is there. Maybe swap positions.
3. Then move ""is"" to the right next to ""baba"", forming ""baba is"", then add ""win"" from wherever it is.

But the ""win"" is currently at 6 right, 3 up, which is far away. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key and then the level is won. But how to get past the walls?

The walls are all ""stop"", so I can't move through them. But I can move the text blocks that define stop. Wait, ""wall is stop"" means that any object named wall has the stop property. If I can change the rule to ""wall is you"" or something, then walls become passable. But that requires moving the ""stop"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 2 step up. So if I can move that rule away, then walls would no longer be stop. But how?

Alternatively, if I can make a rule that overrides ""wall is stop"". For example, ""baba is stop"" would make me stop, which is bad. Not helpful. Or ""wall is you"", making walls passable.

But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move it to another position, maybe I can eliminate the wall's stop property.

But this seems complicated. Let's focus back on the key. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move right and down. But the path is blocked by walls at 2 right, 3 up, etc. Maybe I need to move the walls by changing their rules.

Wait, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"", then walls might not block me. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is part of ""wall is stop"". The components are ""wall"" at 4 left, 2 up, ""is"" at 3 left, 2 up, and ""stop"" at 2 left, 2 up. So if I can break this rule by moving one of these components, I can redefine the wall's property.

For example, move the ""stop"" rule down to somewhere else. If I move it to 2 left, 3 up, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be stop. That would allow me to walk through them.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. Since I'm ""you"", I can move text blocks that are not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is a text block, so if it's not stopped, I can move it. Wait, but ""wall is stop"" means that any wall is stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, so unless it's part of a stop property, it's movable.

This is getting a bit too abstract. Let's think pragmatically about the previous moves. The user tried moving left and right, but the actions failed. Maybe the correct approach is to move towards the ""win"" rule and reposition it next to the key.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe grabbing the key makes me win, even if I can't reach the door. So the solution is to get the key, which is at 4 right, 2 down. To do that, I need to move right and down, but avoid the walls.

Looking at the current positions:

- My position is unclear, but assuming I'm near the ""rule `you`"" at 2 left, 3 down.
- To reach the key at 4 right, 2 down, I need to move right 6 times and down 1 time. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 2 right, 3 up is a wall, but that's up, not directly in the path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a path around the walls. For example, move right to 2 right (but there's a wall at 2 right, 3 up, but maybe not at 2 right, 2 down). Let me check the objects again:

- Wall at 2 right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, 2 right and 1 up, 2 right, 2 right and 1 down, 2 right and 2 down.
- So at 2 right, the columns from up to down are blocked except maybe at 2 right, 2 down (key's position is 4 right, 2 down).

This is really confusing without seeing the grid. Maybe the safest move is to try to move towards the key by right steps, hoping that the path is clear.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the solution is to move the ""win"" rule next to the key. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right, 3 up. If I can move it down to 4 right, 3 up, adjacent to the key at 4 right, 2 down. But moving the ""win"" rule down requires moving it step by step.

First, move right to 6 right, 3 up (the ""win"" rule's position). Then move down to 6 right, 2 up, then left to 5 right, 2 up, etc., until placing ""win"" next to the key.

But this would take multiple steps, and the user is asking for a single action. So perhaps the immediate action is to move right towards the ""win"" rule to start rearranging.

Alternatively, since the previous actions failed, maybe the correct move is to move right to get closer to the key and the rules.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to get to the door, which is defined as ""WIN"" right now. But the active rules say ""key is win"", so maybe picking up the key makes it the win condition? Or maybe I need to change the rules.

First, looking at the current setup. Baba is You, so I can move wherever unless there's a STOP property. The walls are STOP, so I can't go through them. The key is to the right and down from me. Let me check the positions again.

The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. But there's a wall at 1 step right and various positions down. So moving directly right might hit a wall. Wait, there are walls at 1 step right up to 3 steps down. The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need to move around the walls.

But how do I get past the walls? The rules are ""wall is stop"", so unless I change that, the walls are impenetrable. To change rules, I need to move text blocks. The text blocks on the map include ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", and the rules like ""key is win"", etc.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. There's also an ""is"" and ""you"" nearby. Maybe I can rearrange those to make Baba have a different property. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the door (which is win) would let me win. Alternatively, making ""you"" something else so I can push objects or override stop.

But how to move the text blocks. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. If I can get to that key first, maybe picking it up changes the win condition. Wait, the active rule is ""key is win"", so maybe holding the key makes it the win condition. But in Baba Is You, usually, you have to be the win object. So if I can pick up the key (since it's win), but how?

Wait, to pick up the key, I need to be adjacent to it and move into it. But the key is at 4 right, 2 down. My current position isn't clear, but looking at the map, the walls are at 1 step right, so maybe I'm at the starting position near the left side. Let me visualize:

The map has walls forming a corridor on the right. The key is further right, past those walls. The door is at 5 right, 3 down. So to get to the door, I need to go right and down, but the path is blocked by walls. Unless I can change the 'wall is stop' rule.

To change the rule, I need to move the 'wall' text block. The 'wall' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. If I can move that 'wall' text block, maybe I can make it something else. But to move it, I have to be Baba (since I'm You), and the 'wall is stop' means walls are stop, but the text blocks themselves might not be walls unless they're defined as such. Wait, the text blocks are separate objects. The 'wall' text block is a rule, not a wall object. So maybe I can move the rule 'wall is stop' to a different position.

Alternatively, create a new rule like 'floor is stop' to remove the stop property from walls. But how? Let's see. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, and the existing rules. The key is at 4 right, 3 up, then 'is' at 5 right, 3 up, 'win' at 6 right, 3 up. On the left, there's a 'wall' rule at 4 left, 2 up, 'is' at 3 left, 2 up, 'stop' at 2 left, 2 up. Lower down, there's a 'baba' rule at 4 left, 3 down, 'is' at 3 left, 3 down, 'you' at 2 left, 3 down.

So if I can move the 'wall is stop' rule, maybe I can change it to 'wall is not stop'. But first, I need to move the 'stop' text block. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. To move that, I have to be adjacent to it and move into it. But I'm probably on the right side near the starting point. Let me think about the layout.

If I'm starting at the left side, near the 'baba' rule, then moving right towards the key. But the path is blocked by walls on the right. The walls are at 1 step right up to 3 steps down. So maybe I need to get to the 'wall is stop' rule on the left and move it. But how to reach there?

Alternatively, use the key to change the win condition. Since 'key is win', if I can pick up the key (making me key?), then maybe I become the win object. But in Baba Is You, to pick up an object, you have to be the You, which I am (since 'baba is you'). So if I move into the key, I would become key. Then, if key is win, that would make me win. But I need to test that.

But the key is at 4 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to navigate past the walls. Let's see the path from the starting position (probably near the 'baba' rule at 4 left, 3 down). Moving right towards the key: but the walls at 1 step right up to 3 steps down block the path. So maybe I need to create a pass through by changing the wall rule.

If I can move the 'wall is stop' rule to a different position, perhaps replacing it with something else. For example, moving the 'stop' text block to create a new rule like 'floor is stop' or 'wall is push' or similar. But how?

The text blocks are scattered. On the upper left, there's a 'wall' rule at 4 left, 2 up, which is 'wall is stop'. To move that, I need to be adjacent to it and move into it. But where am I? If I'm at the 'baba' rule's position (4 left, 3 down), moving up to the 2 up area might be possible. Let's see:

From 4 left, 3 down, moving up two steps would get to 4 left, 1 down. Then maybe up to 4 left, 2 up, which is where the 'wall' rule is. But the path there might be blocked. Alternatively, moving right from the starting position.

Alternatively, use the key to change the win condition. If I can get the key, then since 'key is win', maybe holding the key makes me the win object. So moving to the key, which is at 4 right, 2 down. But how to get there?

The key is two steps right and two steps down from where I'm assuming I am. But the path is blocked by walls at 1 step right. So maybe I need to move the wall rules to remove the walls. For example, changing 'wall is stop' to something else.

Another idea: if I can make 'baba is win', then touching the door (which is win) would let me win. To do that, I need to move the 'win' text block from 6 right, 3 up to create a rule 'baba is win'. But to do that, I need to move the 'win' block, 'is' block, and 'baba' block together.

The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. The 'is' is at 3 left, 3 down. The 'you' is at 2 left, 3 down. So if I move the 'baba' to the right, 'is' next to it, and 'win' next, I can form 'baba is win'. But how to move them past the walls?

Alternatively, use the key to go around. If I can pick up the key, making me key, then perhaps key can push objects or override stop. But I'm not sure. Let's think step by step.

Current rules:
- key is win: So the key itself is the win object.
- wall is stop: Walls are impassable.
- baba is you: I am controllable as Baba.

Possible actions:
1. Move towards the key to pick it up, making me the win object.
2. Move to the door (which is win) if possible.
3. Change the 'wall is stop' rule to allow moving through walls.
4. Change 'baba' to 'win' to make touching the door win.

For option 1: To get to the key at 4 right, 2 down. Current position is unclear, but assuming I'm near the starting 'baba' rule at 4 left, 3 down. To reach the key, I need to move right four steps and down two steps. But between me and the key are walls at 1 step right, so that's blocking. Unless I can move the walls by changing the rules.

Option 2: The door is at 5 right, 3 down. To get there, same problem: walls block the path.

Option 3: Change 'wall is stop' to something else. The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to the 'wall' text block and move into it. Let's see: from the starting position (4 left, 3 down), moving up to 4 left, 2 down, then left to 3 left, 2 down, etc. But there are walls blocking.

Alternatively, use the key to create a new rule. If I can get the key and then create a rule like 'key is push' or 'key is stop', but not sure.

Option 4: Create 'baba is win'. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. The 'is' is at 3 left, 3 down. The 'win' is at 6 right, 3 up. So I need to move these three text blocks together. To do that, I have to move each adjacent. For example, move 'baba' right to 3 left, 3 down, then 'is' to 2 left, 3 down, then 'win' to 1 left, 3 down. Then combine them as 'baba is win'. But that requires navigating through the map, which has walls.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to pick up the key. Since 'key is win', if I can pick it up, I become the win object. So moving to the key's position.

But how to get there. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. If I'm at the starting point (assuming near 4 left, 3 down), moving right four steps and down two steps. But the path is blocked by walls starting at 1 right. So maybe I need to move the walls by changing the 'wall is stop' rule.

Let's focus on changing the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to the 'wall' text block and move into it. So from my current position (4 left, 3 down), moving up to 4 left, 2 down, then left to 3 left, 2 down, but there's a 'stop' rule at 2 left, 2 up. Maybe this is getting too involved.

Alternative approach: Use the existing 'is' and 'stop' rules to create a new rule. For example, move 'stop' to create 'floor is stop' or 'wall is not stop'. If I can make walls not stop, then I can walk through them.

The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent. From the starting position, moving up to 4 left, 2 down, then left to 3 left, 2 down, 2 left to 2 left, 2 down. Then up to 2 left, 2 up, where the 'stop' rule is. Then move the 'stop' block somewhere else. For example, move it to the right to create a new rule like 'floor is stop'.

But this requires multiple moves and might not be straightforward.

Another idea: If I can make 'baba is stop', then I would be stopped by walls, which is bad. But if I make 'baba is not stop', then I can go through walls. But how?

Alternatively, create 'you is win' to make touching yourself win, but that's unlikely.

Wait, the active rules are 'key is win', 'wall is stop', 'baba is you'. So I am Baba, can move unless stopped. The key is win, so if I can reach the key, maybe that makes me win. But how to reach the key.

Looking at the key's position: 4 steps right and 2 steps down from where? Assuming I'm near the left side. Let me map this out.

Assuming the map's coordinate system: maybe the starting position is at (0,0), and positions are relative. But the observations list objects relative to the player's position. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" means there's a wall two steps right and three up from the player.

In the current observation, the player (Baba) is likely at a position where the walls to the right are 2 steps right, 3 up, etc. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 up, but that might be part of a horizontal line of text blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps the level is structured in a grid where the player needs to navigate around walls. The key is behind several walls, and the door is past those walls. To get past, the player must change the 'wall is stop' rule.

So the plan is: move to the 'wall is stop' rule on the left, rearrange it to remove the 'stop' property from walls, allowing movement through them. Then go around the walls to the key or door.

To do that, the player needs to move the 'wall' text block, 'is', and 'stop' text blocks to form a new rule like 'wall is not stop' or 'floor is stop'. For example, moving 'wall' to the left, 'is' next to it, and 'stop' elsewhere.

But how to navigate there. The player's position isn't explicitly given, but the objects are listed relative to the player. For example, 'wall 2 steps right and 3 up' means to the player's right and up, there's a wall. The text blocks are also positioned relative to the player.

Assuming the player is somewhere near the lower left, with the 'baba' rule at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. To reach the 'wall is stop' rule at 4 steps left and 2 steps up, the player would need to move left and up. But there might be obstacles.

Alternatively, the player can move right towards the key, but the path is blocked. So the only way is to modify the wall rule.

Let's try to outline the steps:

1. Move towards the 'wall is stop' rule on the left.
2. Rearrange the 'wall', 'is', and 'stop' text blocks to create a new rule, such as 'wall is push' or 'wall is not stop'.
3. Once walls are no longer stop, move through them to reach the key or door.

But how to execute this. The player needs to navigate to the text blocks on the left. Let's see the positions:

- 'wall' rule: 4 left, 2 up
- 'is' rule: 3 left, 2 up
- 'stop' rule: 2 left, 2 up

So these three are horizontal, two steps apart. To create a new rule, say 'wall is not stop', the player needs to arrange them as 'wall is not stop'. That would require moving the 'not' text block, but there's no 'not' in the current objects. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop.

Hmm, without a 'not' text block, it's impossible to create a negation. So maybe the solution is to create 'floor is stop' instead, removing the stop property from walls. But 'floor' isn't a present text block. Alternatively, change 'wall' to 'floor' with 'floor is stop', but again, 'floor' isn't available.

This seems tricky. Another approach: since the key is win, maybe the solution is to pick up the key. To do that, move right and down towards it, avoiding walls. Let's see the path:

From the player's position (assuming near the lower left), moving right towards the key at 5 right, 3 up. But the way is blocked by walls at 1 right. So perhaps move up first, then right.

Alternatively, use the existing 'is' and 'you' rules to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, create 'baba is push' to push objects, but that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, the door is at 6 right, 3 down. If I can get there, and since the door is win, that would work. But how to reach it past the walls. Maybe by changing the 'wall is stop' rule.

Another Idea: If I can make 'baba is stop', then I become a stop, which would prevent me from moving, but that's counterproductive. Not helpful.

Alternatively, create 'you is key', making me key, then since key is win, that would make me win. But how to create 'you is key'.

The 'you' rule is at 2 left, 3 down. The 'key' is at 5 right, 3 up. So I would need to move the 'you', 'is', and 'key' blocks together. That's possible but requires navigating through the map.

This is getting really complex. Maybe the intended solution is to pick up the key by moving right and down, but I'm not seeing the path. Let me re-examine the current observation.

Let's see. The goal is to reach the door, right? The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So the key is the win condition, but how do I get there?

First, I need to figure out where I am. The player is Baba, so according to the rules, Baba is you. That means I can move around, but walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to get the key first to make it a win, but the door is maybe a win if I change the rules.

Wait, the current active rule says key is win. So if I pick up the key, does that make me the win? Or does it just mean the key itself is the win object? Hmm. The player (Baba) is you, so if the key is win, maybe touching the key would make me win? Or maybe the door is the win object, but currently, key is win. So maybe I need to get the key to activate the win condition. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the door is the actual win, but the rule says key is win. So perhaps I need to change the rule to make door the win, or make Baba a win. Let's look at the objects. There are rules scattered around. For example, there's a rule 'baba is you' which is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. If I can move that rule somewhere else, maybe I can make baba something else. Like 'baba is win' or 'baba is push'?

But to move those rules, I need to be able to move the text blocks. The rules are probably not stop unless they have 'stop' as a property. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So walls are stop, meaning I can't move through them. However, I can move other objects, including the rules, as long as they aren't defined as stop. Since the rules themselves are text blocks, maybe they can be moved unless they are part of a stop rule.

Looking at the objects, there are several rules. For example, there's a rule 'wall is stop' at 4 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable. That would help me navigate. But how to do that?

Baba is you, so I can move. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. The door is at 5 right, 3 down. The path from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe at the position of the 'baba' rule) to the key is blocked by walls. Wait, the walls are 2 steps right and 3 up, but in the latest observation, the walls are 1 step right and 3 up. So maybe the player is starting near the left side.

Looking at the current map, the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. Wait, the objects list has 'rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down'. So my position is 4 left, 3 down. The door is at 5 right, 3 down. So to reach the door, I need to move right, but there are walls blocking the path.

The walls are at 1 step right and various positions. For example, wall 1 right, 3 up; wall 1 right, 2 up; wall 1 right, 1 up; wall 1 right, down, 2 down, etc. So the path to the right is blocked by walls starting at 1 right, 3 up down to 3 steps down. The door is at 5 right, 3 down. So maybe I need to move the 'wall is stop' rule to remove the stop property from walls, allowing me to pass through them.

The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. To get there, I need to move left from my current position (4 left, 3 down). Wait, my position is 4 left and 3 down. The 'wall is stop' rule is 4 left and 2 up. So moving up one step from my current position would get me to 4 left, 2 down. Then from there, moving left to reach 4 left, 2 up? Wait, directions might be confusing. Let me clarify the coordinates.

Assuming that the player's position is at the 'baba' rule's location: 4 steps left and 3 steps down. To move up, that would decrease the down steps. So moving up from 4 left, 3 down would be 4 left, 2 down. Then moving left again would be 5 left, 2 down? Or is it relative directions? Maybe the map is a grid where each step changes the position in one direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative to the player's current position. For example, 'wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up' means that wall is located 2 steps to the right and 3 up from the player's current position. But this can vary depending on the level layout.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize the map based on the latest observation.

Active rules:
- key is win
- wall is stop
- baba is you

Objects on the map:
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 3 step up
- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- key 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down
- rule `you` 2 step to the left and 3 steps down
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down
- door 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down

Assuming the player (Baba) is at the position of the 'baba' rule: 4 steps left and 3 steps down.

So, from here, looking around:

To the right (increasing right steps): there are walls starting at 1 right, 3 up all the way down to 3 steps down. The door is at 5 right, 3 down. The key is at 4 right, 2 down.

To the left (decreasing right steps): there are rules at 4 left, 2 up (wall is stop), 3 left, 2 up (is), 2 left, 2 up (stop), and further down at 4 left, 3 down (baba rule), 3 left, 3 down (is), 2 left, 3 down (you).

So, perhaps the strategy is to move to the 'wall is stop' rule at 4 left, 2 up, remove it by moving it somewhere else, thereby making walls passable. Then navigate through the walls to reach the key and door.

To get to the 'wall is stop' rule at 4 left, 2 up from the player's position (4 left, 3 down):

- Move up once to reach 4 left, 2 down.
- Then move left to reach 4 left, 2 up? Wait, directions might be confusing. If moving up from 4 left, 3 down brings us to 4 left, 2 down, then moving left would be 5 left, 2 down? Or is it that each step in a direction changes the coordinate accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the coordinates are relative. For example, '4 steps left and 3 steps down' means the position is 4 to the left and 3 below the player's current location. So moving up would decrease the down component.

But this is getting too ambiguous. Maybe the best approach is to try to move towards the 'wall is stop' rule to delete it. Let's see:

From the player's position (4 left, 3 down):

The 'wall is stop' rule is at 4 left, 2 up. So from here, moving up once would place me at 4 left, 2 down. Then, to get to 4 left, 2 up, I need to move up again? But that would be 4 left, 1 down. Hmm, maybe the coordinates are such that up and down are relative. Alternatively, perhaps the map is a grid where each direction changes the position in a specific axis.

This is tricky without a visual, but perhaps the key is to move the 'wall is stop' rule off the grid, effectively deleting it. To do that, I need to pick up the 'wall is stop' rule (which is a text block) and move it somewhere. Since the player is Baba, and baba is you, they can move other objects that aren't stop. Walls are stop, but text blocks (rules) might not be, unless they're part of a stop rule.

The 'wall is stop' rule is a text block. Since the rule 'wall is stop' exists, any object named 'wall' has the 'stop' property. Therefore, the text block 'wall is stop' itself is probably not stop unless it's defined as such. But since it's a rule, maybe it's movable.

So, to delete the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to move it off the grid. For example, move it down past the other objects. Let's see where it is: 4 left, 2 up. To move it, say, down two steps, to 4 left, 0 up (or 4 left, 4 down?), but I need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the 'wall is stop' rule to the position of another rule, effectively replacing it. For example, moving it to where the 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. But not sure.

Alternatively, the goal might be to make Baba the win. Since the current key is win, but maybe if I change the rule to 'baba is win', then touching the door (which is a win if key is win, but maybe not) or just being Baba would make me win. But the door is at 5 right, 3 down. To get there, I need to pass through walls, which are stop. So unless I remove the stop property from walls, that's a problem.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the 'wall is stop' rule (4 left, 2 up) and remove it by moving it off the grid.
2. Then navigate through the now-passable walls to the key (4 right, 2 down) and then to the door (5 right, 3 down).

To move the 'wall is stop' rule, I need to go there. From the player's position (4 left, 3 down):

- Move up once to 4 left, 2 down.
- Then move left to reach 4 left, 2 up? Or is moving left from 4 left, 2 down to 5 left, 2 down? This is unclear. Maybe the directions are relative. For example, 'left' would decrease the right steps. So if the player is at 4 left (which is 4 steps to the left from a central point), moving left would increase the left steps. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps all positions are relative to the player's starting point. So '4 steps left' means 4 steps to the left from where the player began. But without knowing the absolute layout, it's hard.

Alternatively, think in terms of movement steps. The player can move up, down, left, right one step at a time. The objects are positioned at certain relative coordinates. So to reach the 'wall is stop' rule at 4 left, 2 up, the player needs to move left and up.

From the player's position (assuming starting at 0,0):

- The 'baba' rule is at (-4, -3) (4 steps left, 3 steps down).
- The 'wall is stop' rule is at (-4, -2) (4 left, 2 up).
- So to move from (-4, -3) to (-4, -2), the player needs to move up once.
- Then from (-4, -2), to reach the 'wall is stop' rule, which is at (-4, -2), they are already there? That can't be. Maybe the coordinates are different.

I think I'm getting mixed up with the coordinate system. Let's try a different approach.

Looking at the objects:

The player is at the 'baba' rule's position: 4 steps left and 3 steps down.

The 'wall is stop' rule is 4 steps left and 2 steps up from the player's position. So from the player's location, moving up two steps would get to that rule. Wait, the rule is 2 steps up, so moving up twice.

So action sequence:

1. Move up once.
2. Move up again.
3. Now at the 'wall is stop' rule.
4. Move this rule off the grid, perhaps by moving it down.

But to move the rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it. Assuming each move is one step, moving up twice from the player's initial position gets them to the 'wall is stop' rule.

Once there, they can take the rule and move it. For example, move it down, so it's no longer in the active rules. That would remove the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable.

After that, the player can move right through the walls to the key and then to the door.

So the steps would be:

- Up, Up (to reach the 'wall is stop' rule)
- Take the rule (maybe by moving it somewhere)
- Then move right through the walls.

But how to express this in actions? Each action is a single step: up, down, left, right.

So first, move up twice to get to the 'wall is stop' rule.

Then, since the rule is there, perhaps the player can move it. For example, move down with the rule, effectively deleting it.

But in the game, to move a text block, you have to be adjacent to it and then move in a direction, which would move the text block with you.

So, after moving up twice to the 'wall is stop' rule, the player can move down (carrying the rule), which would place it below, perhaps off the play area, removing it from active rules.

Then, the walls are no longer stop, so the player can move right through them.

Once walls are passable, the player can move right towards the key and then to the door.

So the action sequence would be:

1. up
2. up
3. down (to move the 'wall is stop' rule down)
4. right (now that walls are passable)
5. right
6. right
7. down
8. right
9. right

But the problem is that each action must be a single step, and the assistant needs to output one action at a time.

In the current observation, the player is at the 'baba' rule's position: 4 left, 3 down. The 'wall is stop' rule is 4 left, 2 up. So the first action should be to move up once to get closer.

But in the previous interactions, the assistant kept getting stuck, maybe because the path wasn't clear.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 right, 2 down, which is to the right and down from the player's position. So after removing the 'wall is stop' rule, moving right and down towards the key.

But this requires a series of steps. Given that the previous attempts failed, maybe the immediate action is to move up to reach the 'wall is stop' rule.

So the first action should be 'up' to move towards it.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The current active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key, which is treated as the win condition. But the key is located at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up from my current position.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. That's blocking the direct path upwards. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule defined by the text blocks near the left side. So, any object with ""stop"" can't be moved past. The walls are definitely stops, so I can't go through them.

My avatar is likely at the position of ""baba"", which is 4 steps to the left and 4 steps down from the key's current location. Wait, no, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. Let me map this out. The key is at (4 right, 2 up), and the baba rule is at (4 left, 3 down) from the key? Maybe I need to adjust the coordinates based on where the player is. This might be a bit confusing without a visual, but let's proceed.

To reach the key, I need to move up to get past the wall at (1 right, 2 up). But moving up from my current position (assuming I'm at the same spot as the ""baba"" rule) would take me to the wall. Wait, the ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down from where? Maybe the key is at (4r, 2u) relative to some origin. Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is implied by the objects nearby. Let's check the objects again.

The key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. The walls are forming a path that might require moving around them. The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, which might be near the player's starting position. 

If the player is at the ""baba"" rule location (4 left, 3 down), then moving right would head towards the walls. Alternatively, maybe the player's position is in the center, and the rules and objects are spread out around. This is a bit unclear, but the key is at 4r, 2u, but there's a wall at 1r, 2u. So the path directly up from the player's position is blocked by a wall. 

Looking at the other objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. That might be part of the wall's definition. The walls are all defined as ""stop"", so they can't be pushed past. Therefore, the player needs to find a way around the walls. 

The key is 4 steps right and 2 steps down from where? Maybe the player needs to move right past the walls. Let's see: the walls to the right are at 1r, 2r, 3r, etc., up and down. The key is at 4r, 2d. So moving right from the player's current position (assuming they're near the left side) might be possible. But the ""baba"" rule is at 4 left and 3 down, so perhaps the player is to the right of that. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position where ""baba"" is a rule, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down from some reference point. This is getting a bit tangled. Let's focus on the immediate obstacles. The key is two steps down and four steps to the right. But moving right from the current position is blocked by walls at 1r, 2r, etc. However, the walls are only in certain directions. For example, there's a wall at 1r, 3u, which is three steps up and one step right. Wait, no, the walls are listed as:

- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right
- etc.

Wait, maybe the player is at the position ""baba"" rule, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I'm at 4L3D, then moving right would take me towards the walls. Let's see the wall positions:

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up (from baba's position, that's 1R3U)
- wall 1R2U
- wall 1R1U
- wall 1R
- Then down to 1R1D, 1R2D, etc.

The key is at 4R2D from baba's position. So moving right from baba's position (4L3D) would require moving right four steps to reach 0L (origin) and then right four more steps, but there are walls at 1R, 2R, etc. So the path directly right is blocked. 

The alternative is to move up around the walls. From baba's position (4L3D), moving up would take me to 4L2D, then 4L1D, 4L0D (origin), but there's a wall at 1R3U, which is three steps up and one step right from the origin. So if I move up from baba's position, I'd have to navigate around those walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can push a rule or an object. Since ""baba is you"", the player can move any object that's not stopped. The ""key is win"" rule is a text block that can be moved, perhaps. The rules are at various positions. For example, the ""key"" rule is at 4R3U (from the current observation, after moving up previously). Wait, in the last observation after moving up, the key is now at 4R2U. So maybe the player needs to move the ""key is win"" rule to change the win condition, but that might not be necessary if the key itself is the win object. 

Wait, the active rule is ""key is win"", meaning that touching the key makes you win. So the goal is to reach the key. But the key is behind a wall. How to get past the wall? Since walls are ""stop"", the player can't move through them. But perhaps the player can move the wall rule or the ""stop"" property. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2L2U. If the player can move that rule, maybe they can remove the ""stop"" property from the wall, allowing it to be passed. To move a rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction, provided that the destination isn't blocked by a ""stop"" object. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. The player is at the ""baba"" rule position, which is 4L3D. So the distance between the player and the ""stop"" rule is quite large. They would need to move right and up to reach it, but there are walls in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""wall"" rule. The ""wall"" rule is at 4L2U. If the player can move that rule, they could potentially remove the wall's ""stop"" property. But again, moving that rule would require navigating past the walls. 

Another approach: since the player is ""baba"", maybe they can rewrite the rules. For example, if the player can create a new rule like ""baba is stop"", then the player would become a stop and couldn't move. That's probably not helpful. Alternatively, ""you is win"" to make the player the win condition, but the key is still needed. 

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the player is baba, and they can move any object that's not stopped. The walls are stopped, so can't be moved. The text blocks (rules) can be moved if they're not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 2L2U, which is part of what makes the walls stop. If the player can move the ""stop"" rule, they could remove the stop property from walls. 

So the plan could be: move the ""stop"" rule away, then the walls would no longer be stops, allowing the player to pass through them. To do that, the player needs to navigate to the ""stop"" rule, which is at 2L2U. From the player's current position (4L3D), moving right and up would be necessary. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can move other rules first. For example, the ""key is win"" rule is at 4R3U. If the player moves that rule, perhaps they can place it near the key to reinforce the win condition, but that's not immediately helpful. 

Another idea: since the key is at 4R2D, and the door is at 5R3D, maybe the door is the exit, but the key is needed to open it. However, the active rule says the key is the win condition, so touching the key should be enough. 

Wait, in the current observation, after moving up, the key is now at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps up. The player's position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 steps left and 3 steps down. So moving right from there would take the player towards the walls. Let's calculate the coordinates:

Assuming the player is at position (0,0), then:

- ""baba"" rule is at (-4, -3)
- ""key"" is at (4, 2)
- The walls are at various positions, like (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3), (1,-4)
- The ""stop"" rule is at (-2, 2)
- The ""key is win"" rule is at (4,3)
- The ""wall"" rule is at (-4,1)

So the player needs to move from (-4,-3) to (4,2). The direct path is blocked by walls from (1,3) down to (1,-4). To get around, the player might need to go around the walls either to the left or right. But going left from (-4,-3) is not possible without more map info. Going right, the walls start at (1,3) and go down to (1,-4). So the player needs to navigate around these walls.

One possible path is to move up from (-4,-3) to (-4,-2), then (-4,-1), (-4,0), (-4,1), etc., but there's a ""wall"" rule at (-4,1), which is part of the stop rules. So moving up past that would be blocked. Alternatively, move right from (-4,-3) to (-3,-3), then check if that's blocked. But there's no wall mentioned at (-3,-3), so maybe that's possible. 

If the player moves right step by step:

1. Move right to (-3,-3)
2. Right again to (-2,-3)
3. Right to (-1,-3)
4. Right to (0,-3)
5. Right to (1,-3) â€“ but there's a wall at (1,-3), so can't move there.

So that path is blocked. Another approach: move up from (-4,-3) to (-4,-2), then right to (-3,-2), etc., avoiding the walls. Let's see:

- From (-4,-3), move up to (-4,-2)
- Then right to (-3,-2)
- Right to (-2,-2)
- Right to (-1,-2)
- Right to (0,-2)
- Right to (1,-2) â€“ there's a wall at (1,-2), so can't go there.

Still blocked. Maybe move further up. From (-4,-2), move up to (-4,-1), then right to (-3,-1), etc. But again, walls at (1,-1) and others. 

This seems challenging. Alternatively, the player could move some rules to alter the environment. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule at (-2,2) away. To do that, the player needs to navigate to (-2,2), which is quite far. From (-4,-3), moving up and right:

1. Move up to (-4,-2)
2. Up to (-4,-1)
3. Up to (-4,0)
4. Up to (-4,1) â€“ there's a wall rule here, but the wall itself is at (1,1), so maybe this is a text block. Wait, the ""wall"" rule is at (-4,1), which is a text block saying ""wall is stop"". To move this rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it. 

So from (-4,-3), moving up to (-4,-2), (-4,-1), (-4,0), (-4,1). At (-4,1), there's the ""wall"" rule. The player can pick this up and move it. For example, moving it down to (-4,2). Then the ""wall is stop"" rule is no longer at (-4,1), so the wall at (1,1) might no longer be a stop? Wait, no. The ""wall is stop"" rule defines that any object named ""wall"" has the ""stop"" property. So moving the ""wall is stop"" rule elsewhere doesn't remove the stop property from existing walls; it just changes where that rule is located. 

Hmm, so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, the player could create a new rule, like ""wall is not stop"", but to do that, they need to manipulate the existing rules. 

Another idea: since the player is ""baba"", maybe they can create a rule that makes themselves able to move through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"". To do this, the player would need to move the ""stop"" rule or create a new rule. 

To create a new rule, the player would need to have the ""is"" text block. Looking at the objects, there's an ""is"" rule at (5,2) (assuming the current observation's ""is"" rule is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up). The player would need to move the ""is"" rule, combine it with ""baba"" and ""not stop"", but the game's mechanics might require physically placing the text blocks together to form a new rule. 

For example, if the player moves the ""baba"" rule, the ""is"" rule, and the ""not stop"" rule (if available) to the same position, they can create ""baba is not stop"". But in the current observation, there's no ""not stop"" rule. The available rules are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"". 

Alternatively, the player could move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, effectively removing it, but that wouldn't create a ""not stop"" rule. 

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Touch the key (which is the win condition).
- Key is at (4,2), blocked by walls starting at (1,3) down to (1,-4).
- Player is at (-4,-3).
- Need to find a path around the walls or alter the rules to remove the stop property from walls.

Possible actions:

1. Try to move around the walls by moving up and right, but path is blocked.
2. Move rules to alter the stop property. For example, move ""stop"" rule away, but not sure how that helps.
3. Create a new rule like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is move"" to manipulate objects differently, but not sure.

Looking at the current objects, there's a ""rule `you`"" at 2 step to the left and 3 steps down. The player is ""baba is you"", so they are the ""you"" object. Maybe combining ""you"" with other rules? 

Alternatively, since the key is at (4,2), and the player is at (-4,-3), the shortest path is through the lower right, but the walls are there. Maybe move down to avoid the upper walls.

From (-4,-3), move down to (-4,-4). Is there a wall there? The objects listed don't mention walls below (1 step down etc.), but the map might extend beyond. Assuming moving down is possible, the player could go around the walls on the lower side. 

Let's try:

1. Move down from (-4,-3) to (-4,-4)
2. Then right to (-3,-4)
3. Right to (-2,-4)
4. Right to (-1,-4)
5. Right to (0,-4)
6. Right to (1,-4) â€“ there's a wall there, so can't move.

Still blocked. Hmm.

Another approach: use the ""key is win"" rule to your advantage. Since the key is the win object, maybe the player doesn't need to pathfind but can find a way to touch it by moving the rules that block its path. For example, if the wall at (1,3) is defined by the ""wall is stop"" rule, moving that rule away might make the wall no longer a stop. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-4,1). If the player moves this rule, say to (-4,2), then the wall at (1,3) would still be a wall but without the ""stop"" property, allowing the player to move through it. 

To move the ""wall is stop"" rule from (-4,1) to, say, (-4,2):

1. Player needs to be adjacent to the ""wall is stop"" rule at (-4,1).
2. Move right to (-3,1), then to (-2,1), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1) â€“ but there's a wall at (1,1), which is stopped. So can't move past it.
   
This seems impossible. Alternative path to reach (-4,1):

From (-4,-3), move up to (-4,-2), (-4,-1), (-4,0), (-4,1). At each step, check for walls. The path is clear except for the ""wall"" rule at (-4,1) itself, which is a text block. So the player can move it.

So:

1. Move up from (-4,-3) to (-4,-2)
2. Up to (-4,-","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, which is the key in this case. But since key is win, maybe grabbing the key makes me the win condition? Or maybe it changes the win condition to something else? Let me check the objects.

Looking at the map, the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down from my current position. There are walls all around to the right and some above and below. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down, which is probably the exit. But the door might be stop because of the wall is stop rule. Wait, no, the door isn't listed as a wall. Hmm.

Since baba is you, I can move around, but walls are stop. So I need to navigate through the walls. The key is at (4 right, 2 down). To get there, I need to move right twice, then down once. But there's a wall at 2 steps right, 1 step up, and others blocking the path. Let me visualize:

Current position: Let's assume I'm at the starting point, maybe at (0,0). The walls are to the right and up/down. The key is at (4,2). But there's a wall at (2,1) up, so I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to move up first to avoid the wall?

Wait, the walls are at specific positions. Let me parse the objects again:

Walls:
- 1 right, 3 up
- 1 right, 2 up
- 1 right, 1 up
- 1 right (same level)
- 1 right, 1 down
- 1 right, 2 down
- 1 right, 3 down
- 1 right, 4 down

Key is at 4 right, 2 down. So from my current position (assuming at (0,0)), moving right once gets to (1,0), which is a wall. So I can't go right directly. Maybe I need to move up first to get around the wall?

Looking at the rules, since I'm Baba and baba is you, I can move objects that aren't stop. The walls are stop, so I can't push them. The key is a win object. If I grab the key, since key is win, does that make me the win? Or does it change the rule? Maybe I need to create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving 'baba', 'is', and 'win' together.

The rule blocks for 'baba' are at 4 left, 3 steps down for 'baba', 'is' at 3 left, 3 steps down, and 'you' at 2 left, 3 steps down. So if I can move those rule blocks to form ""baba is win"", then I would become win. Let's see their positions:

rule `baba` is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down from where? Assuming each step is relative to the current position. Wait, the observation says the objects are positioned relative to the player? Or is it a grid where each position is absolute? The problem is a bit unclear, but I think the steps are relative to the player's current position.

Wait, the user's previous actions were left, right, etc., so it's likely a grid where you move relative to your current spot. For example, if the player is at (0,0), moving right takes them to (1,0).

So the rule 'baba' is 4 steps to the left and 3 steps down from the player's position. That would place it at (-4, -3). Similarly, the 'is' is at (-3, -3), and 'you' at (-2, -3). To form ""baba is you"", the player would need to move these blocks adjacent to each other. But the player's current position might be different now. Let me check the latest observation.

In the last observation before this, the player moved up, and now the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the objects, maybe the player is at (1,2) or something. This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at a position where they can reach the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' rules to rearrange them.

Alternatively, since key is win, if the player picks up the key, they might become the win object. In Baba Is You, sometimes holding an object makes you that object. So if I take the key (since key is win), then I would become win, allowing me to walk over the door which might not be stop anymore? Or the door could be redefined.

But the door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So path might be blocked. Alternatively, if I can change the rule to 'door is you' or 'door is win', then I could reach it.

Another approach: The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So to get past the walls, I need to either move around them or change the 'wall is stop' rule. To change a rule, I need to move the text blocks. For example, if I can make 'wall is not stop' or 'stop is wall' or something else.

The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. So if I can move the 'stop' text block, maybe I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule. But how? Since I'm Baba and can move objects unless they're stop. The 'stop' property is on the wall, so walls are immovable. But the text blocks for the rules are separate. The 'stop' rule is a text block at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move that text block, I could relocate the 'stop' rule.

But to move the 'stop' rule, I need to be able to move it. Since the rule 'wall is stop' defines walls as stop, but the 'stop' rule itself is a text block. If I can move the 'stop' text block, then I can change where stop applies. For example, moving 'stop' to 'key' would make keys stop, which might block the key from being useful. Alternatively, moving 'stop' to nothing or another object.

But how to move the 'stop' rule? The player (Baba) can move objects that are not stop. The 'stop' rule is a text block. Is a text block considered stop? If the rule is 'wall is stop', then walls are stop, but text blocks aren't necessarily stop unless defined. So maybe I can move the 'stop' text block.

In the last observation, the 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. So if I can move that text block, perhaps to somewhere else. For example, moving it to 'baba' would make Baba stop, but that would make me unable to move. Alternatively, moving 'stop' to an empty space or to another rule.

Alternatively, the key is win, so if I can get the key and then move to the door, maybe the door becomes win. But the door's position is at 5 right, 4 down. There's a wall at 1 right,4 down, so I need to find a path.

Wait, the player's current position isn't specified, but based on the objects, maybe they are near the left side. Let's assume the player is at position (0,0). Then:

- The 'baba' rule is 4 left, 3 down: (-4,-3)
- 'is' is 3 left, 3 down: (-3,-3)
- 'you' is 2 left, 3 down: (-2,-3)

To create ""baba is you"", the player needs to move these rule blocks adjacent. So from (-4,-3) (baba), move right to (-3,-3) (is), then right to (-2,-3) (you). Then the rule would be baba is you, which it already is. But that's not helpful. Maybe the player needs to create a new rule like ""baba is win"".

The 'win' rule is at 6 right, 2 up. So from (0,0), that's (6,2). To get there, need to move right 6, up 2, but there are walls at 1 right, 3 up; 1 right, 2 up; etc. So path is blocked.

Alternatively, the key is at 4 right, 2 down. So from (0,0), move right 4, down 2. But there's a wall at 1 right,1 up. Maybe move up first to avoid walls.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me try to map this out:

Assuming the player is at (0,0):

- Wall at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) [same level], (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3), (1,-4).

Key is at (4,-2). So to get there, need to go right 4, down 2. But the path is blocked by walls from (1,0) onwards to the right. So maybe need to go around upper or lower.

But the upper path has walls at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So can't go up. Lower path has walls at (1,-1), (1,-2), (1,-3), (1,-4). So also blocked. So the only way is to move right past the wall at (1,0), but that's a wall. Wait, (1,0) is a wall, so can't go through. So how?

Unless I can change the 'wall is stop' rule. If I can move the 'wall' rule, which is at 4 left,1 up (from previous observation), which would be (-4,1) if player is at (0,0). That's quite far. Alternatively, the 'wall' rule is at 4 step to the left and 2 step up in the current observation. So from player's position (assuming), that's (-4,2). To get there, need to move left 4, up 2, but player can't move through walls.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: Since key is win, picking up the key makes me win. In Baba Is You, often holding an object makes you that object. So if I can reach the key, then I become win, allowing me to pass through other win objects or doors.

The key is at (4,-2). To get there, need to navigate around the walls. Let's see the path:

From (0,0), move down to (0,-1), but there's a wall at (1,-1). So can't go right. Maybe move left? But the 'baba' rules are to the left. Alternatively, move up to avoid walls.

Wait, the player's position isn't clear. Maybe I should try to move towards the key step by step.

In the last observation, after moving up, the key is at 4 right and 2 down. So if the player is at (0,0), moving right twice and down once would reach (2,-1), but there's a wall at (1,0) which is the same level. Wait, this is getting too confusing without knowing the player's exact position.

Alternatively, focus on manipulating the rules. Since the goal is usually to reach the door, which might be a win object, but currently, the win is the key. If I can change the win to door, then reaching the door would win.

To do that, I need to create a new rule ""door is win"" by moving the 'door', 'is', and 'win' text blocks together. The 'win' is at 6 right,2 up. The 'door' is at 5 right,4 down. The 'is' is at 5 right,2 up. So maybe moving 'is' between 'door' and 'win'?

But the player needs to move these text blocks. Assuming the player can move the text blocks that are not stop. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left,1 up. So text blocks aren't stop unless they're part of a stop rule. Since 'wall is stop', the wall objects are stop, but the text blocks like 'key', 'is', 'win', etc., are movable unless specified otherwise.

So the player can move the 'is' block, 'win' block, and 'door' block to form ""door is win"". But the positions are spread out. The 'door' is at 5 right,4 down. 'is' is at 5 right,2 up. 'win' is at 6 right,2 up. So to form ""door is win"", need to move 'door' to the left, 'is' down, and 'win' left.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: Since baba is you, and key is win, if I can get the key and then reach the door, maybe the door becomes win when held. But not sure.

Alternatively, if I can make the door a you, then I can move into it. So creating ""door is you"" by moving the 'door', 'is', and 'you' blocks together.

The 'you' block is at 2 left,3 steps down. So from player's position, that's (-2,-3). To get to the door at (5,4), need to move a lot. This seems difficult.

Perhaps the easiest way is to move to the key and pick it up, making me win. Then, even if the door is stop, as win, I can pass through. Let's try that.

To reach the key at 4 right,2 down from player's position. Assuming player is at (0,0), need to move right 4, down 2. But path is blocked by walls from x=1 onwards. So how?

Unless there's a way to move around using the rule blocks. For example, if I can change the 'wall is stop' to 'stop is flower' or something, but there's no flower in the map.

Alternatively, use the existing rule blocks to create a new rule that allows movement. For example, create ""baba is push"" to push walls, but there's no 'push' property mentioned.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So nothing about pushing. Maybe create ""baba is push"" by moving 'baba', 'is', 'push' together. But there's no 'push' text block. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you, door.

So to create ""baba is push"", need to have a 'push' text block, which doesn't exist here. So that's not possible.

Back to the key. If I can reach it, becoming win. Let's see the path again. Maybe move up first to avoid the wall at (1,0).

From (0,0), move up to (0,1). Then right to (1,1), but that's a wall. Can't go. Move up to (0,2). Then right to (1,2), which is a wall. Move up to (0,3). Right to (1,3), wall. Stuck.

Alternatively, move down. From (0,0), down to (0,-1). Right to (1,-1), wall. Down to (0,-2). Right to (1,-2), wall. Down to (0,-3). Right to (1,-3), wall. Down to (0,-4). Right to (1,-4), wall. Still stuck.

This is frustrating. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules. For example, make 'key is you', so the key becomes the you object, and then I can move it. But how?

The current rules are key is win. To change that, I need to replace the 'win' in the key's rule with 'you'. The key's rule is at 4 right,3 step up. So if I can move the 'win' block to the key's rule, forming ""key is you"".

To do that, I need to move the 'win' block (which is at 6 right,2 up) to the key's rule position (4 right,3 up). But the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the 'is' block between them.

This seems too complex. Maybe another angle: The door is at 5 right,4 down. There's a wall at 1 right,4 down. So to get to the door, need to go around. If I can move the wall, but walls are stop. Alternatively, change the 'wall is stop' rule to 'wall is not stop', allowing walls to be moved.

To change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is [something else]', I need to move the 'stop' text block. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left,1 up. So from player's position, that's (-2,1). To get there, need to move left 2, up 1. But player is likely on the right side near the key.

This is really tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'baba', 'is', and 'you' rules to create ""baba is win"", making the player win. The 'you' rule is at 2 left,3 down. So from player's position, that's (-2,-3). To get there, move left 2, down 3. But there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, the key is win, so grabbing it makes me win. Even if there's a wall in front, as win, maybe I can pass through. Let's try moving right towards the key, ignoring the walls. In Baba Is You, if you're win, you can override stop properties. So maybe even if there's a wall, as win, you can move over it.

So the plan is: move right until I reach the key, then down to get past the walls, and then to the door. Even if there are walls, since I'm win, I can pass through.

So the actions would be: right, right, right, right, down, down. But need to see if the path is possible.

In the latest observation, the key is at 4 right,2 down. So from player's position (assuming near the left), moving right 4 times, then down 2. But along the way, at step 1 right, there's a wall at (1,0). But if I'm win, maybe I can pass through the wall. So the action would be to keep moving right past the wall.

So the chosen action is right.

Let me try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The goal is usually to reach the door, which is probably acting as the win condition, but the rule says key is win. So maybe I need to get the key instead? But the key is win now. Let me check the objects.

Looking at the map, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. There are walls around on the right side. The Baba rule is at 4 steps left and 4 steps down. Hmm, maybe I need to move that rule to make Baba something else, like YOU? Wait, but the current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So I'm already Baba, so if I can reach the key, since key is win, that would solve it? Or maybe the door is the win now? Wait, the active rules say key is win, so getting the key should make it a win. But how do I get there?

The walls on the right are all stop, so I can't move through them. But I might be able to move the text blocks to change the rules. Let's see. The rules for wall, key, and win are on the top right. If I can move those blocks, maybe I can change the stop property or the win condition. For example, if I can make door IS WIN, then going to the door would work. But how do I get to those rules?

Baba is me, so I can move the text blocks that are not stop. The rule 'stop' is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. Wait, the objects include rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up. So that's a text block that's making things stop. But since I'm Baba, which is you, can I move that? Wait, the rules are wall is stop, so any wall is stop. But the text blocks themselves might not be walls unless they're defined as such. Wait, the rules are separate from the objects. The objects are walls, key, door, etc. The text blocks like 'is', 'win', 'key', etc., are separate and can be moved if they're not stopped.

But the 'stop' rule is making certain objects stop. So, for example, the wall objects are stop. So I can't move through walls. But the text blocks like 'key', 'is', 'win', 'baba', etc., can be moved unless they are under a stop rule. Let me check the active rules again: wall is stop. So any object named wall is stop. The text blocks themselves are not walls unless they are part of a rule. So maybe the text blocks can be moved.

So, to move a text block, I need to be next to it and move in a direction. For example, the 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 4 steps down. If I can move that, maybe I can change it to something else. But how do I reach it? Let's see the current position. From the observation, the player (Baba) is likely at the starting position. Let me assume the player is at the position where the 'baba' text block is not located. Wait, the objects list includes 'rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 3 steps down' and another at 4 steps left and 4 steps down. Maybe the player is somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is adjacent to some of these text blocks. Let's see. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. The 'you' rule is at 2 left, 3 steps down. So if I can move the 'you' rule to be part of Baba, maybe I can make myself win. Wait, the current rules are baba is you, so the player (Baba) is you. So if I can make, say, baba is win, then Baba would be win, and reaching anywhere would be a win, or maybe just being Baba would be a win. Alternatively, making door is win would let me go to the door.

But how to move the text blocks. Let's look at the available actions. The possible moves are up, down, left, right, or idle. So I need to move towards a text block that's not stopped, pick it up, and move it to create a new rule.

For example, the 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move that rule away, maybe I can then move other rules. But the 'stop' rule is making things stop, so if I move it, perhaps the walls are no longer stop. Wait, no. The 'wall is stop' rule defines that any wall is stop. If I remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then walls are not stop anymore, so I could move through them. That's a possible approach.

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the 'wall is stop' rule, which is at 4 step left and 1 step up. Wait, looking at the objects: rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 1 step up, rule `is` 3 step to the left and 1 step up, rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 1 step up. So the 'wall is stop' rule is made of 'wall' 'is' 'stop' at those positions. To break this rule, I need to move one of these text blocks.

But to move any of them, I have to be adjacent to the text block and move in a direction. Let's say I want to move the 'stop' text block. It's at 2 left, 1 up. If I can get to that position, I can move it. But how do I get there? The player's position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the objects, perhaps the player is near the bottom left or somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule. Let's assume the player is at the initial position, perhaps at 0,0. Then, to reach the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 1 up, I would need to move left twice and up once. But the walls might block the path. For example, there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 step up. Not sure.

Alternatively, focus on the key. Since key is win, getting the key would make it a win. The key is at 4 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to move right four times and down two times. But there are walls on the right side. For example, walls at 2 steps right and 3 up, 2 right and 2 up, etc. So moving right directly would hit walls. Unless I can change the wall rules.

If I can remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then the walls would no longer be stop, and I could move through them. To do that, I need to move one of the components of 'wall is stop', like the 'stop' text block. The 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 1 up. So moving that 'stop' text block away.

To move the 'stop' text block at 2 left, 1 up, I need to be adjacent to it. If the player is nearby, say at 1 left, 1 up, then moving left would take them to 2 left, 1 up, and then they can pick up the 'stop' block and move it elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule. Let's check the 'baba' rule is at 4 step to the left and 3 steps down and another at 4 step left and 4 steps down. So if the player is at 4 left, 4 down, they can move up or right. But I'm not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move to the 'stop' text block at 2 left, 1 up.
2. Pick it up and move it to a different location, say, drop it next to the 'wall is' part of the rule.
3. This would break the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls not stop.
4. Then, move through the walls to reach the key.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes 'baba' a 'win'. For that, I need to move the 'win' text block and combine it with 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'win' text block is at 6 right, 2 up. The 'is' is at 5 right, 2 up. So if I can move 'baba' next to 'is' and 'win', creating 'baba is win', then Baba would be win, and the level would be solved just by standing in place.

To do that, I need to move the 'baba' rule's text blocks. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down and 4 left, 4 down. Maybe moving the 'baba' text block to the area where 'is' and 'win' are.

But how to reach that area. The 'is' and 'win' are at 5 and 6 right, 2 up. That's on the right side, which has walls. If walls are stop, I can't move there. Unless I remove the 'wall is stop' rule first.

So the plan could be:

1. Remove 'wall is stop' by moving the 'stop' text block.
2. Then move through the walls to the right side.
3. Create 'baba is win' by rearranging the text blocks there.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. Since the key is win, maybe getting the key is sufficient. But to reach the key, need to navigate past the walls.

Another angle: since the key is win, maybe just standing on the key makes it a win. But the key is at 4 right, 2 down. If I can move there, then key is win would mean touching the key wins. So how to get there.

If I can make the walls not stop, then I can move through them. So removing 'wall is stop' is key.

To remove 'wall is stop', I need to move one of the components: 'wall', 'is', or 'stop'. The 'stop' is at 2 left, 1 up. Let's focus on that.

Assuming the player is at a position adjacent to the 'stop' block, they can pick it up and move it. For example, moving left from 2 left, 1 up to 3 left, 1 up, etc. But where to move it? If I move it down, perhaps below the current rules, so that the 'wall is stop' rule is broken.

Once 'wall is stop' is removed, the walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them. Then, navigate to the key's location at 4 right, 2 down. Along the way, there are walls at 2 right, 3 up, 2 right, 2 up, etc. But if walls are not stop, I can move through them.

So step-by-step:

1. Move to the 'stop' text block at 2 left, 1 up.
2. Pick it up and move it down, say to 2 left, 2 down. This breaks the 'wall is stop' rule.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so I can move through them.
4. Move right past the walls to reach the key at 4 right, 2 down.
5. Once on the key, since key is win, the level is solved.

Alternatively, after removing 'wall is stop', maybe create a new rule like 'baba is win' to make Baba win immediately.

To create 'baba is win':

- Need 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks in sequence.

The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down and 4 left, 4 down. The 'win' is at 6 right, 2 up. The 'is' is at 5 right, 2 up.

This seems distant. Maybe after removing the wall rule, move the 'baba' text block to the right side.

But this would require moving multiple blocks, which might be complicated.

Alternatively, focus on getting the key. Let's try to outline the movements:

Assuming the player is at the starting position, perhaps near the bottom left.

First, move left to reach the 'stop' block at 2 left, 1 up. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 step up. Not sure about the path.

Alternatively, move up to the 'key' area. But there are walls on the right.

This is getting too vague without knowing the exact starting position. Maybe I need to look for the player's position.

Wait, in the observations, the objects list includes various walls, keys, rules, etc., but the player's position isn't explicitly mentioned. In Baba Is You, the player is typically represented by the 'Baba' object, which in this case is part of the rules: 'baba is you'. So the player is the Baba object, which is wherever the 'Baba' text block is located. Looking at the objects, there's a 'rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 3 steps down' and another at 'rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 4 steps down'. So the player is at the position of the 'Baba' text block. Let's assume the player is at 3 left, 3 down.

From there, to move to the 'stop' text block at 2 left, 1 up, the player would need to move left once and up three times. But there might be walls in the way. For example, at 2 left, 3 up there's a wall. So moving up from 3 left, 3 down to 3 left, 2 down (which is a wall?), no, the walls are at specific positions. Let me check the walls listed:

wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up

wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up

wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up

wall 2 steps to the right

wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step down

etc. So walls are all on the right side, at various positions. The player is on the left side at 3 left, 3 down. To get to 2 left, 1 up, the path is clear except for possible walls. Let's see:

From 3 left, 3 down:

- Move left to 2 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, walls are at 2 right, not 2 left. So probably no wall. Then move up to 2 left, 2 down, then 2 left, 1 down, then 2 left, 1 up. Arrive at the 'stop' text block. Then pick it up and move it, say, down to 2 left, 2 up. This would break the 'wall is stop' rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so the player can move through them. Then move right past the walls on the right side to reach the key at 4 right, 2 down.

But how to move right past the walls. For example, from 2 left, 1 up (after moving the 'stop' block), the player can move rightwards. The walls on the right are at 2 right, 3 up, etc. But since walls are no longer stop, the player can move through them. So moving right past them to 4 right, 2 down where the key is.

Once the key is reached, since key is win, the level is solved.

Alternatively, after removing 'wall is stop', the player could create a new rule 'baba is win' by moving the 'baba' text block next to 'is' and 'win'.

The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. To get there, the player would need to move from their current position (after moving the 'stop' block) to 4 left, 3 down. Then, arrange 'baba', 'is', 'win' in a row.

But this might be more complex.

Considering the steps needed and the possibility of errors, the most straightforward path might be to remove the 'wall is stop' rule, then move to the key.

So the sequence of actions would be:

1. Move left to reach the 'stop' text block at 2 left, 1 up.

But wait, the player's initial position is at the 'baba' rule's location, which is 3 left, 3 down. So from there:

Move left once to 2 left, 3 down.

Move up three times to reach 2 left, 0 down (assuming down is negative). Wait, directions are relative. The observation uses steps like ""1 step to the right and 3 step up"", so up is positive Y, right is positive X.

Assuming the player is at (0,0), but the actual positions are relative. This is getting confusing without a visual map. Maybe I should try to navigate based on the relative positions.

Alternatively, the key is at 4 right, 2 down. To get there, the player needs to move right four times and down two times. But there are walls on the right. If walls are stop, can't move through. So need to remove the 'wall is stop' rule first.

So first, move to the 'stop' text block at 2 left, 1 up. How to get there:

From the player's starting position (assuming near the 'baba' rule at 4 left, 3 down?), move left to 3 left, 3 down, then left to 2 left, 3 down. Then move up to 2 left, 2 down, 2 left, 1 down, 2 left, 1 up. Arrive at the 'stop' block.

Once there, pick up 'stop' and move it down, say to 2 left, 2 up. This breaks the 'wall is stop' rule.

Now, walls are not stop. Move right past the walls on the right. For example, from 2 left, 1 up (after moving 'stop'), move right to 3 left, 1 up, then 4 left, 1 up, etc., but the walls are at 2 right, so maybe the player is on the left side. This is getting too unclear without knowing the exact layout.

Perhaps a better approach is to focus on creating 'baba is win' rule. To do that, need to move the 'win' text block to be next to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'win' is at 6 right, 2 up. The 'is' is at 5 right, 2 up. The 'baba' rule is at 4 left, 3 down. So moving the 'baba","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the door, which I think is the WIN object, but right now the active rule says ""key is win"". So the key is what counts as winning. But the key is down to the right somewhere. There are walls everywhere that are STOP, so I can't just move through them. But since I'm Baba, and the rule is ""baba is you"", I can move. I need to get to the key and then maybe use it to do something. But how?

Looking at the map, the key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down from my current position. Wait, where exactly am I? The observation shows objects relative to the player's position. Let me parse the objects:

- The wall is 1 step to the right and 2 steps up. So maybe the player is 1 step left and 2 steps down from that wall?
- The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps up from the player. But there are other walls blocking the path. Like, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps up, and others below. Hmm, the player might be in a position where they can move right or down.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So touching the key makes me win. But the key is surrounded by walls? Let's see:

The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. But there's a wall at 1 step right, and walls further down. Maybe I need to move right to get to the key. But moving right directly might hit a wall. Let me check the path. If I go right from my current position, I can maybe get past the walls. Wait, the walls are 1 step right and 2 steps up, then 1 step right and 1 step up, and the player is at the origin. So moving right once would take me to the wall at 1 step right? Or is the player's position different?

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the grid. The player is somewhere, and the objects are positioned relative to them. Let's assume the player is at (0,0). Then:

- Wall is at (1, 2) [right 1, up 2]
- Key is at (4, -2) [right 4, down 2]
- The door is at (5, -4) [right 5, down 4]

There are walls along the path to the key. For example, at (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), etc. So to get to the key at (4,-2), the player needs to move right past those walls. But the problem is that the walls are STOP, meaning they can't be passed unless they're changed. But since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe they can push objects? Wait, the rules don't mention pushing. The allowed actions are moving directionally. So maybe the player has to move around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the player can manipulate the rules. For example, if they can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, then the walls wouldn't block. But to do that, they need to move the ""wall"" text block next to the ""is stop"" rule and rearrange them. Let's see the rule positions:

The ""wall is stop"" rule is made up of:
- rule `wall` at 4 steps left and 1 step up
- rule `is` at 3 steps left and 1 step up
- rule `stop` at 2 steps left and 1 step up

So the original rule is ""wall is stop"", formed by those three text blocks. To change this rule, the player would need to move these text blocks. But can the player move them? The text blocks are not tagged as STOP, so they can be moved. So if the player can reach those text blocks and rearrange them, they can change the rule.

For example, if the player moves the ""stop"" text block to another position, they could create a new rule, like ""wall is you"" or something. But where is the player currently located? Let's assume the player is at (0,0). The ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 steps left and 4 steps down. So the text blocks for that rule are:

- rule `baba` at (4,-4)
- rule `is` at (3,-4)
- rule `you` at (2,-4)

So those are pretty far away. To reach them, the player would need to move left and down, but there are walls at (1,0), (1,-1), etc., blocking the path. Unless there's a way around.

Alternatively, maybe the player can first reach the key by moving around the walls. Let's see. If the player is at (0,0), moving right once would take them to (1,0), but there's a wall there. So can't go right. What about down? Moving down from (0,0) would take them to (0,-1), which is a wall at (1,-1)? Wait, the walls are at (1,-1), (1,-2), etc. So moving down from (0,0) to (0,-1) is possible because there's no wall there? Wait, the objects list has ""wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down"", which would be at (1,-1). So the player is at (0,0), and moving down to (0,-1) is clear. Then from there, move right? Let's see:

From (0,0), down to (0,-1). Then right to (1,-1), but there's a wall there. Can't go right. So maybe move down again to (0,-2). From there, right to (1,-2), which is a wall. Hmm. This seems blocked. Maybe the player needs to go around another way.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move up. From (0,0), up to (0,1). But there's a wall at (1,1). So can't go up. How about moving up twice to (0,2), but there's a wall at (1,2). Still blocked. So maybe the initial approach of moving right directly is blocked.

Therefore, perhaps the only way is to manipulate the rules. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or something. But to do that, the player needs to move the text blocks of the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks:
- rule `wall` at (-4,1) [4 steps left, 1 step up]
- rule `is` at (-3,1)
- rule `stop` at (-2,1)

So these are to the left of the player. The player is at (0,0). To reach them, the player needs to move left. But moving left from (0,0) would take them to (-1,0), (-2,0), etc. But are there walls blocking this path?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (1,-4) [1 step right, 4 steps down], which is probably not in the way. The walls blocking the upper path are at (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), etc. So moving left from (0,0) seems possible, unless there's a wall there. But I don't see a wall mentioned in the objects list to the left of the player. The walls are all to the right and upper left.

So the player could move left to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule text blocks. Let's plan the path:

From (0,0):

1. Move left 4 steps to reach the ""rule `wall`"" at (-4,1).
But wait, the player's position is (0,0). Moving left 4 steps would take them to (-4,0). But the ""rule `wall`"" is at (-4,1). So the player needs to move left 4 steps to (-4,0), then up 1 step to (-4,1) to grab the ""wall"" text block.

Once the player has the ""wall"" text block, they can move it somewhere else to change the rule. For example, they could create a new rule like ""wall is YOU"", which would make walls passable. But how?

Alternatively, the player could take the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall is stop"" rule and move it to another part to create a new rule. For example, if they make ""stop is key"", then stop wouldn't block. But this requires rearranging the text blocks.

This seems complicated, but maybe it's the way to go. Another option is to change the ""key is win"" rule to make the door the win condition. If the player can reach the ""key is win"" rule and change it to ""door is win"", then they could just go to the door. But the ""key is win"" rule is at (4,2) relative to the player. So the player would need to move right 4 steps and up 2 steps, but there are walls blocking that path (like the wall at (1,2)).

So moving directly to the key or the rule texts is blocked by walls. Therefore, the player must find a path around the walls while managing the text blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps the player can push the walls? But the rules don't mention pushing, and the walls are STOP, so they can't be moved. Unless the player can change the rules to allow moving walls.

Another angle: since the key is considered WIN, touching it makes the player win. So the goal is to reach the key. The key is at (4,-2) relative to the player. To get there, the player needs to navigate through the grid avoiding STOP walls.

Let's map out the possible path from (0,0) to (4,-2):

Possible route:

1. Move down to (0,-1)
2. Move right to (1,-1) â€“ wall, can't.
3. Move down to (0,-2)
4. Move right to (1,-2) â€“ wall, can't.
5. Move down to (0,-3)
6. Move right to (1,-3) â€“ wall at (1,-3)? Looking at objects, there's a wall at (1,-3) as per ""wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down"", which is (1,-3). So can't go there.
7. Move down to (0,-4)
8. Move right to (1,-4) â€“ there's a wall at (1,-4)? The objects list has a wall at (1,-4) as ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 steps down"". So can't go right.
9. Move left instead? From (0,-4), left to (-1,-4), but not sure if that's helpful.

This seems blocked. Maybe another route:

From (0,0):

1. Move left to (-1,0)
2. Move left to (-2,0)
3. Move left to (-3,0)
4. Move left to (-4,0) â€“ reach the ""rule `wall`"" at (-4,1). But need to get up there.
5. From (-4,0), move up to (-4,1) to grab the ""wall"" text block.
6. Now, with the ""wall"" text block, move it to somewhere else. For example, next to ""is stop"" to make a new rule.

But this requires navigating past any walls in between. From (-4,0) to (-4,1), is there a wall? The objects list doesn't mention walls at (-4,0) or (-4,1), so it should be possible.

Once the ""wall"" text block is moved, perhaps create a rule like ""wall is YOU"", making walls passable. Then the player can move through walls. But how to do that?

Alternatively, create a rule ""stop is key"", which would remove the STOP property from walls, making them passable. But the ""stop"" text block is part of the original ""wall is stop"" rule. If the player moves the ""stop"" text block, they can use it elsewhere.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe the fastest way is to first reach the key by moving around the walls using rule manipulation.

Alternatively, since the key is WIN, maybe the player can pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is at (4,-2), and there are walls along the way. Unless the player can find a way to move around them by changing rules.

Another thought: the player is Baba, and ""baba is you"". So if the player can create a rule like ""baba is win"", then touching themselves would make them win. But that requires creating a new rule.

To create a new rule, the player needs to have the necessary text blocks. The ""baba"" text block is at (-4,-4), ""is"" at (-3,-4), and ""you"" at (-2,-4). So the player would need to move those blocks to form ""baba is win"".

But to get there, the player would have to navigate through a lot of walls. It seems too far.

Alternatively, maybe the player can use the existing ""key is win"" rule to their advantage. If they can pick up the ""key is win"" rule and change it to ""baba is win"", then touching themselves would win.

The ""key is win"" rule is at (4,2) relative to the player. So moving right 4 and up 2, but there's a wall at (1,2). So how to get there?

Maybe the player can first move to the ""wall is stop"" rule, rearrange it to make walls passable, then go around the walls to the key.

Let me try this plan:

1. Move left to (-4,0) to get the ""wall"" text block.
2. Move up to (-4,1) to pick up the ""wall"" block.
3. Now, move right to (0,1), avoiding any walls. Since there's a wall at (1,1), the player can't go right. So move down to (0,0), then left to (-4,0) again? Maybe this isn't working.

Alternatively, move the ""wall"" block next to the ""is stop"" to form ""wall is ... something else"". For example, move ""wall"" to be next to ""is stop"", making ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is top"" or something. But that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the player can create a rule like ""stop is you"", which would make STOP properties act as YOU. But the player would need the ""stop"" text block and rearrange it.

The ""stop"" text block is part of the original ""wall is stop"" rule at (-2,1). So if the player moves the ""stop"" block to another position, say next to ""baba is you"", they could create ""baba is stop"", making Baba a STOP, which is bad. Not helpful.

Alternatively, move ""stop"" to create ""win is stop"", but that also doesn't help.

Hmm. Maybe the key is reachable by moving down and right after manipulating a rule.

Another idea: If the player can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then they could push the walls out of the way. But I'm not sure if that's possible. To do that, the player would need to rearrange the ""wall is stop"" text blocks into ""wall is push"".

This requires moving the ""is"" block as well. For example, take ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" and rearrange them to ""wall is push"". But ""push"" isn't a text block on the map. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you.

So maybe the player can create a new rule ""wall is push"" by using the existing ""is"" block and adding ""push"". But ""push"" isn't available. Unless they can use another text block. This seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the player can delete the ""stop"" property from walls by moving the ""stop"" text block away. For example, if the original rule is ""wall is stop"", and the player moves the ""stop"" block elsewhere, then the rule becomes ""wall is "", which is invalid, thus walls no longer have the STOP property. But the game might still consider them as STOP if there's another rule. Not sure.

If walls are no longer STOP, then the player can move through them. That would solve the problem. So the plan would be:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule and separate the ""stop"" text block.
2. Move the ""stop"" block to a different location, thus removing the STOP property from walls.
3. Then navigate to the key freely.

Let's try to execute this step by step.

Current player position: Assume (0,0).

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at:
- rule `wall` at (-4,1)
- rule `is` at (-3,1)
- rule `stop` at (-2,1)

To separate the ""stop"" block, the player needs to move from (0,0) to (-2,1), which is the position of the ""stop"" block.

Path to (-2,1):

1. Move left 4 steps to (-4,0).
2. Move up 1 step to (-4,1) â€“ this is the ""wall"" text block. Not needed yet.
3. Move right 1 step to (-3,1) â€“ ""is"" text block.
4. Move right another step to (-2,1) â€“ ""stop"" text block. Grab it.

Now, with the ""stop"" block in hand, move it to a new location. For example, move it down to (-2,2). This would remove it from the ""wall is stop"" rule, effectively deleting that rule. Now, walls might no longer be STOP.

Then, the player can move right past the walls to the key.

But how to confirm if walls are no longer STOP? If the player can now move through walls, then they can proceed.

From (-2,1) with the ""stop"" block, move down to (-2,2). Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. The new rule would be ""wall is "" (incomplete), which might not exist, so walls might not have the STOP property anymore.

Then, the player can navigate to the key at (4,-2).

Path from (-2,2) to (4,-2):

1. Move right 4 steps to (2,2).
2. Move down 4 steps to (2,-2).
3. Move right 2 steps to (4,-2) â€“ which is the key.

But along the way, there are walls at (1,2), (1,1), etc. But if walls are no longer STOP, the player","

I need to figure out how to get to the door in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by looking at the active rules: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. Since the goal is usually to reach the object marked as win, which is the key in this case, but the key is also set as the win condition. That might mean that picking up the key makes me win? Or maybe I need to move the key to a different location?

Looking at the objects, there's a door at 5 steps to the right and 4 steps down. To reach that door, I probably need to move through or around the walls. The walls are marked as stop, so I can't move into them. But since I'm Baba and baba is you, I can move freely unless blocked by a stop. Wait, but the walls are stop, so I have to avoid them.

Let me map out the positions. The player (Baba) is likely at the position right (the center point). To the right and up are walls, and to the right and down there are more walls. The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. Wait, no, looking again: the wall is at 1 step right and 2 steps up, then moving down, there are walls at 1 step right and 1 up, 1 right, then 1 step right and 1 down, etc. The key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. The door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down, but there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So the path to the door might be blocked by that wall.

But how do I get past the walls? Since wall is stop, I can't move through them. Maybe I need to redefine the rules. The key is win, so if I can make the door the win condition instead, then reaching it would solve the level. Or perhaps make Baba have the WIN property. Let's see the available text blocks.

There are rule blocks for key, is, win, wall, stop, and the ones for baba being you. If I can move the 'win' rule to the door, then stepping on the door would make me win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' and 'win' text blocks together to form ""door IS WIN"". But the current 'win' is attached to the key. So maybe I need to break that rule first.

The key is 6 steps right and 2 steps up in the initial observations, but as the game progresses, the positions might shift when moving objects. The latest observation shows the key at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So I need to navigate to where the 'win' rule is (which is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up in earlier states) and move it. However, in the current state, the 'win' rule is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up, but the player is at 1 step right. So moving towards the right makes sense.

But the walls are in the way. The path to the right is blocked by walls at 1 step right and up, then more walls as I go down. Wait, the player is at 1 step right, and to move right, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, but maybe that's in a different direction. Let me check the current obstacles.

In the current observation, the player is at the position 'wall 1 step to the right' which might mean the player is next to that wall. So to move right, there's a wall blocking. But the active rules say wall is stop, so I can't move into it. So I need to find a way to either remove the wall's stop property or redefine the movement.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and baba is you, maybe I can push other objects if they're not stop. But the wall is stop, so I can't push it. The key is win, so maybe I can pick it up? But how does that help? If I take the key, since key is win, maybe carrying the key makes me win? Not sure. The door is the final objective, but it's behind a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps down.

Wait, in the current objects, the door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. There's a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps down, but that's much to the left. Wait, the door is further to the right. So perhaps moving right past the walls. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 step up, 1 step right and 1 step up, etc. So the player is at 1 step right, and to move right, there's a series of walls upwards and downwards. Maybe I need to go around them.

Alternatively, redefining the rules. For example, if I can make 'stop' something else, then the walls wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the 'stop' rule. The current 'stop' rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. If I can move that to another object, then the walls might no longer be stop. But moving that requires moving the 'is' and 'stop' blocks together to form a new rule. For example, moving 'stop' to 'key' would make key stop, but that might not help. Or moving 'stop' to 'baba' would make Baba stop, which is bad.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key. But the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. The player is at 1 step right. To get there, need to move right, but the path is blocked by walls. Wait, looking at the current map:

- The player is at position 1 step right (assuming starting point is 0,0).
- Moving right, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, but that's up. The immediate right has a wall at 1 step right and 2 step up, but maybe the player is at 1 step right, and to move right further, there's a wall at 2 steps right. So to get to the key at 4 steps right and 3 steps down, the path is blocked by multiple walls.

Perhaps the solution is to use the text blocks to create a new rule that allows movement through walls. For example, if I can make 'baba' not stop, but that's already the case since baba is you. Alternatively, make 'wall' something else. If I can change 'wall is stop' to 'wall is ...' something else, then walls wouldn't block.

To do that, I need to break the 'wall is stop' rule. To break a rule, I need to move the 'is' that's part of it. The 'wall is stop' rule is formed by the 'wall' text block, an 'is' text block, and the 'stop' text block. If I can move the 'is' between 'wall' and 'stop' to another pair, I can change the rule.

Looking at the current text blocks:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 2 step up

These form ""wall IS stop"". To break this, I need to move the 'is' block away. If I can move the 'is' to connect 'baba' with another property, like 'you', then the rule would be ""baba IS you"" (which is already active), and ""wall IS [something else]"". But how?

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes 'baba' able to move through walls. For example, ""baba IS push"" or ""baba IS move"", but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, make 'stop' a different property. If I can make 'stop' be 'key', then keys would stop, but that's not useful.

Another idea: since the key is win, if I can move the 'win' rule to the door, then reaching the door would make me win. The door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. So I need to move the 'win' text block (which is currently at 6 steps right and 2 steps up) along with the 'is' block to the door's position. Then form the rule ""door IS win"".

To do that, I need to navigate to where the 'win' and 'is' blocks are, move them to the door's location, and combine them. The current 'win' is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up, and 'is' is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. The door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. So I need to move the 'is' and 'win' blocks down and left to reach the door.

But the player is at 1 step right. Moving right towards the 'win' and 'is' blocks would require passing through walls. Alternatively, maybe the player can move up to reach the text blocks first. Let's see the current positions:

Player is likely at the position that's 1 step right (since there's a wall there). To move up, is there a path? Looking at the walls: wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up, wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up, etc. So moving up from the player's position would hit walls. Maybe moving down? There's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc. So moving down is also blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to push the text blocks past the walls. But since walls are stop, and the text blocks might not be stop unless defined. Wait, the text blocks like 'is', 'win', etc., their properties depend on the rules. Since 'wall is stop', any object named 'wall' is stop. But the text blocks themselves are probably not walls unless associated. So maybe I can move the 'is' and 'win' blocks past the walls by moving them while avoiding the stop walls.

Alternatively, use the key to create a path. Since the key is win, if I take the key, maybe I can move it somewhere. But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can move text blocks by pushing them if they're not stop. Since the key is win, but not stop (unless there's a rule making key stop), so if key is not stop, I can push it. Then, place the key near the door to make ""key IS win"" near the door, but that doesn't change the win condition.

Wait, the win condition is currently ""key IS win"", so having the key somewhere makes the win condition be wherever the key is. Or does it mean that the key itself is the win object? I think the win condition is that you need to touch the object that is defined as win. Since key is win, touching the key wins. But the door is separate. So maybe the level requires touching the key to win, but the door is just there. But in the latest observation, the door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down, and the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe the path to the key is blocked, and redefining the rules is necessary.

Another approach: make 'baba' the win. Since ""baba IS you"" and if I can make ""baba IS win"", then touching baba (yourself) would win. To do that, I need to move the 'is' and 'win' blocks to create ""baba IS win"". The current 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, 'is' at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, and 'you' at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the 'win' block next to 'baba' and 'is', forming ""baba IS win"", then touching baba would win. 

The 'win' block is currently at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. To get it to the baba's position, I need to move it left and down. But the path might be blocked by walls. Alternatively, use the existing 'is' block near the baba rule to connect 'baba' with 'win'. The 'is' block is at 3 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I move the 'win' block to 4 steps left and 3 steps down (where the 'baba' rule is), then combine them with the 'is' block. That would make ""baba IS win"", meaning touching baba wins. Then I can just stay in place and win.

But how to move the 'win' block there? The 'win' block is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. To move it left, I need to navigate around the walls. The player is at 1 step right. To move the 'win' block, I might need to use other movable objects. Since the key is win and not stop, maybe I can push the key to create space. But the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest solution is to move the 'win' rule to the door. Since the door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down, I need to move the 'win' and 'is' blocks there. The 'is' block is at 5 steps right and 2 steps up. So moving it down to 4 steps down and right to 5 steps right. Then combine with 'door' to make ""door IS win"". 

To do that, I need to push the 'is' and 'win' blocks down and right. But the player is at 1 step right, so moving towards the 'is' and 'win' blocks would require moving right past walls. Alternatively, maybe the player can move up to reach the 'is' and 'win' blocks first. Let's see:

The player is at 1 step right. To move up, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 step up. So can't go up. To move down, there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step down. So can't go down directly. Maybe move right around the walls. To move right, there's a wall at 2 steps right. But how? Unless there's a way to move around it by redefining rules.

Alternatively, make the wall not stop. If I can change 'wall IS stop' to 'wall IS push', then walls can be pushed. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' block in the wall rule. The wall rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps up, 'is' at 3 steps left and 2 steps up, 'stop' at 2 steps left and 2 steps up. So if I move the 'is' block to connect 'wall' with 'push', then the rule becomes 'wall IS push', allowing me to push walls.

Once walls are pushable, I can push them out of the way. For example, the wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps up can be pushed left. But how to do that? The player is at 1 step right. To reach the wall at 2 steps right, need to move right, but there's a wall there. If walls are pushable, maybe the player can push them. But since the player is Baba and baba is you, and the wall is push (if the rule is changed), then yes.

So the steps could be:

1. Change 'wall IS stop' to 'wall IS push' by moving the 'is' block.
2. Push the walls out of the way to create a path.
3. Move the 'win' and 'is' blocks to the door's location to create 'door IS win'.
4. Reach the door to win.

But this requires navigating to the wall rule's 'is' block, which is at 3 steps left and 2 steps up. The player is at 1 step right. To get to 3 steps left, the player needs to move left, but there's probably a wall there too. Hmm, this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, focus on moving the 'win' rule to the door. Since the door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down, and the 'win' is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up, the player needs to move these blocks diagonally down and left. But the player's movement is limited by the walls.

Maybe the solution is to use the key to create a new rule. Since the key is win, if I can place the key next to the door and make ""key IS door"", but that doesn't change the win condition. The win condition is still ""key IS win"", so touching the key wins. But the door is separate. Maybe the level requires touching both the key and the door, but that's not clear.

Another angle: the initial rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. If I can make 'baba' have the 'win' property, then touching baba would win. To do that, create the rule ""baba IS win"". The existing 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down, with 'is' at 3 steps left and 3 steps down, and 'you' at 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So if I can move the 'win' block next to 'baba' and 'is', forming ""baba IS win"", then I win by staying still.

The 'win' block is currently at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. To move it to 4 steps left (where 'baba' is), the player needs to move left and down. But the player is at 1 step right. Moving left would require passing through walls unless the wall rule is changed. 

This seems really complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'key' to the door and make it the win condition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, push the door using the key, but doors are usually not pushable.

Wait, looking back at the latest observation, the door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down, and there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 steps down. So the path to the door from the player's position (1 step right) is blocked by walls on the upper path and the lower path. The only way might be to redefine the 'stop' rule to something else, allowing movement through walls.

If I can make 'stop' be 'key', then keys would stop, but that's not helpful. Or make 'stop' be 'nothing', but that's not possible. Alternatively, remove the 'stop' rule by moving it away. If I can move the 'stop' block far away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. The 'stop","

Let's see. I need to figure out how to get from where Baba is to the door. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". Right now, Baba is a ""you"" because of the ""baba is you"" rule. The goal is usually to reach the object defined as ""win"", which in this case is the key. But the key is currently acting as the win condition because of the ""key is win"" rule.

Looking at the map, the walls are all marked as stop, so I can't move through them. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 4 steps down. But how do I get there? There's a key at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. If I can pick up the key, maybe that changes something. But wait, the key is already set as the win condition. So maybe I don't need to pick it up? Or maybe picking it up allows me to pass through walls?

Wait, the rules say ""wall is stop"", so even if I have the key, which is win, does that affect the walls? Let me think. In Baba Is You, sometimes combining objects can change their properties. For example, if there's a rule ""flag is push"", then pushing the flag would work. But here, the key is win, so maybe touching the key makes me win? But the door is the usual win condition, but here it's the key. Wait, noâ€”the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key would make me win. But the door is also present. Maybe the door is a separate win condition, but it's overridden by the key rule.

Wait, the initial problem says the goal is usually to reach an object defined as ""WIN"", but here the key is WIN. So the goal is to get the key. But the key is at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. However, there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the map.

Baba is probably at the starting position. Let's say the current position is the reference point. The walls are to the right in various steps up and down. The key is 4 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to move right and down, but the walls are in the way. The rule blocks are also scattered. To move objects like the rules, they need to not be STOP. The ""stop"" property is assigned to walls, so I can move the rule blocks if they're not stopped.

Wait, the rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So the rule blocks themselves are not stopped unless they're part of a STOP rule. The ""stop"" rule applies to walls. So I can move the rule blocks. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can change the win condition to the door. That way, reaching the door would be the goal. But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push other objects. But the walls are STOP, so I can't push them. The key is not a STOP, so maybe I can move it. If I can grab the key and carry it somewhere, but I think in Baba Is You, you can't carry objects; you can only move adjacent objects if they're not STOP.

Wait, the action commands are move directions. So each step, I can move up, down, left, right, or idle. To get to the key, which is 4 right and 3 down from my current position, but there are walls blocking the path. Let's see: the walls are at 1 step right in various directions. For example, wall 1 step right and 2 steps up, etc. So maybe the path to the key is blocked by walls. But perhaps there's a way to rearrange the rules to remove the wall blocks.

Alternatively, since the key is WIN, maybe touching it makes me win. So maybe the solution is to reach the key. But how to get past the walls? If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, then walls would no longer be STOP, and I could walk through them. But moving the rule blocks requires them to not be STOP. The ""stop"" rule is applied to walls, so the rule blocks themselves (like ""wall is stop"") are not stopped unless they're part of a wall. Wait, the rule blocks are separate objects. The ""stop"" property is on the walls, not on the rule blocks. So I can move the rule blocks as long as they're not themselves stopped. Since the rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"", none of these rule blocks are stopped. So I can pick them up and move them.

For example, if I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else, like removing it from the map, then walls would no longer be STOP, and I could walk through them. But how to remove a rule? You have to move the text blocks that form the rule. So ""wall is stop"" is three text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". To delete this rule, I need to move one of these blocks away so the rule is broken. Similarly, to create a new rule, I can combine text blocks.

So the plan is: either remove the ""wall is stop"" rule to allow moving through walls, or change the ""key is win"" rule to make the door the win condition, then go to the door.

Let me think. First, where are the rule blocks? The ""key is win"" rule is at 5,6,7 steps right and 3 step up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3,2,1 steps left and 2 step up. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 2,1 steps left and 3 steps down.

To remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move one of its components. For example, move the ""stop"" block. The ""stop"" rule block is at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" block away, the ""wall is stop"" rule would be destroyed, making walls not STOP anymore. Then I could walk through walls.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes walls passable. But how?

Alternatively, make the door the WIN by moving the ""win"" block from the key to the door. The ""win"" block is at 7 steps right and 3 step up. The door is at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. So if I can move the ""win"" block to the door's position, then the door becomes WIN, and I can go there.

But how to move the ""win"" block. The ""win"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule. To move it, I need to break that rule first. So maybe move the ""key"" or ""is"" block from the ""key is win"" rule, then take the ""win"" block elsewhere.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push other objects. But the rule blocks are not STOP unless they're part of a wall. So the rule blocks can be moved. Let's say I move the ""win"" block from the ""key is win"" rule to the door. To do that, I need to first break the ""key is win"" rule by moving one of its components. For example, move the ""key"" block from the ""key is win"" rule to somewhere else. Then, take the ""win"" block and place it at the door's location, along with an ""is"" and a ""door"" to make ""door is win"". But where is the ""door"" text block? Looking at the objects, the door is a regular object at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. There's no ""door"" text block, so I can't create the rule ""door is win"" unless there's a ""door"" text block. But in the current objects, the door is an object, not a text block. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, use the existing ""you"" rule. Since ""baba is you"", maybe I can make ""baba is win"" to win by touching Baba. But that seems unlikely. The active rules are ""key is win"", so touching the key wins. But the key is at 4 right, 3 down. If I can get there by moving through walls by removing the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So back to removing ""wall is stop"". The ""stop"" block is at 1 step left and 2 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" block, say, one step to the right, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken, and walls would no longer be STOP. Then I could walk through the walls.

But how to move the ""stop"" block. The ""stop"" block is a text block, not part of a wall. So since walls are STOP, but the text blocks are separate. So I can move the ""stop"" block. Let's see its position: rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up. So from my current position, to get to the ""stop"" block, I need to move left 1 and up 2. But there might be walls in the way. Let me check the map.

Current position: probably at the origin (since walls are 1 step right, etc.). So to get to the ""stop"" block at 1 step left and 2 step up, I need to move left once, then up twice. But is there a wall blocking that path? Looking at the walls: wall 1 step right and 2 step up. So from the origin, moving left 1 is possible (no wall there), then up 2 steps. Let's see:

From origin, move left 1 (to the leftmost position), then up 2 steps. But between origin and there, are there walls? The wall at 1 step right and 2 step up is in the opposite direction. So moving left and up should be clear. Once I reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 2 up, I can move it. For example, move it one step to the right, which would be at the origin's level (0 left, 2 up). Then the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because the ""stop"" block is no longer adjacent to ""wall"" and ""is"". 

Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is removed, walls are no longer STOP, so I can walk through them. Then I can go around the walls to the key or the door. Alternatively, since the key is WIN, maybe just approach it freely.

But how to move the ""stop"" block. The action would be to move left to get to it, then move it right. So step by step:

1. Move left once to reach the ""stop"" block's position (1 left, 2 up).
2. Then move the ""stop"" block right by one step, placing it at (0 left, 2 up), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Once that's done, walls are no longer STOP. Then I can move right through the walls towards the key or door.

Alternatively, after removing ""wall is stop"", go to the key at 4 right, 3 down. But there are walls at 1 step right in various positions. Since walls are no longer STOP, I can walk through them. So from the origin, move right 4 steps, down 3 steps, walking through the walls. But need to check the path.

Alternatively, go to the door at 5 right, 4 down. Since door is WIN, and if I can reach it, that would win the level. But the door is behind walls. But if walls are passable, then yes.

But first, I need to execute the steps to remove the ""stop"" rule. So the actions would be:

- Move left to get to the ""stop"" block.
- Move the ""stop"" block right to break the rule.
- Then move towards the door or key.

But how to represent this in the actions. Each action is a single move direction. So the initial moves would be left, left, up, up, right, right, etc. Wait, but the positions are relative. Let's clarify the positions based on the observation.

The observation lists objects relative to the player's position. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" means that to the right and three up from the player is a wall. The player's current position is the reference point (0,0).

The ""stop"" rule block is at 1 step left and 2 step up from the player. So to reach it, the player needs to move left once, then up twice. So the sequence would be:

1. left (to 1 left, 0 up)
2. up (to 1 left, 1 up)
3. up (to 1 left, 2 up) â€“ now at the ""stop"" block
4. Then, move the ""stop"" block. Since it's a text block, the player can move it in any direction. For example, move it right to 0 left, 2 up.
5. Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken because the ""stop"" block is no longer adjacent to ""wall"" and ""is"".

After that, walls are no longer STOP, so the player can walk through them. Then, to reach the door at 5 right, 4 down, the player can move right 5 times and down 4 times, passing through the walls since they're no longer STOP.

But each move is one step. So after removing the ""stop"" rule, the actions would be:

right, right, right, right, right, down, down, down, down.

But the player needs to execute these steps. However, the problem is that the model might get stuck in a loop of failed actions if it doesn't find the correct sequence. But based on the current observation, the latest one shows that after several ""idle"" defaults, the player is still at the same position. So the correct action now is to move left to reach the ""stop"" block.

Looking at the latest observation, the active rules and objects are the same as before. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step left and 2 step up. So the immediate action should be to move left to get to that position. Once there, the next action would be to move the ""stop"" block, but since the model can only output one action at a time, the first step is to move left.

But wait, the action must be a single direction: up, down, left, right, or idle. So the correct action now is to move left to reach the ""stop"" block.

18,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
I need to figure out how to get to the door in Baba Is You. Let's start by looking at the current rules and objects.

The active rules are: key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. That means touching a wall or a key makes me stop or win respectively. But since key is win, picking up the key would make me win? Wait, no, the rule says key is win, which probably means that if I have the key, it counts as a win. Or maybe the key itself is the win object. Not sure yet. But the goal is usually to reach the door, which isn't mentioned here. Wait, the active rules don't have anything about the door being a win. The original level might have had door is win, but in the current state, it's not active. Hmm.

Looking at the objects, there's a door at 6 steps to the right and 4 steps down. To get there, I need to navigate through the walls. But the walls are stop, so I can't move through them. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe picking up the key changes something. If key is win, maybe having the key allows me to pass through walls? Or maybe the key becomes the win object, so I need to bring it to a certain spot. But the door is the usual win, but since the rule isn't active, maybe I need to change that.

Wait, in the current rules, 'key is win' means that the key itself is what you need to touch to win. So maybe I need to grab the key first. But how do I get to the key? The key is at 5 right, 3 down. My current position isn't specified, but looking at the objects, the player (Baba) is probably at the starting point, perhaps near the left side. Let me check the map again.

There's a rule `baba` at 3 steps left and 4 steps down, followed by `is` and `you`. So combining those, ""BABA IS YOU"" is a rule, which makes sense because the player is Baba. So the player is Baba, and can move unless stopped by a wall.

The walls are spread out to the right. The path to the key is blocked by walls on the right. To get to the key at 5 right, 3 down, I need to move right past the walls. But the walls are stop, so I can't push them unless they're not stop. Wait, the rules say wall is stop, which means walls are immovable. So I can't go through them. Therefore, I need to find a way around.

Looking at the map, the walls to the right are from 2 steps right up to 3 steps down. The key is at 5 right, 3 down. Maybe I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make 'wall' not stop, then I can push walls. Or maybe change the win condition to the door.

The key is win, so if I can pick up the key, does that make me win? Or does it mean that the key is the object to reach? Not sure. Maybe I need to move the 'key is win' rule somewhere. But to do that, I have to move the text blocks 'key', 'is', and 'win' together to form a new rule. For example, moving them to say 'door is win', which would make the door the target.

Alternatively, maybe I can make 'baba' have a property that allows passing through walls. Since currently, baba is you, and wall is stop, touching a wall stops you. If I can change 'baba is you' to 'baba is push' or something, but I don't have that rule here. So I need to create a new rule by rearranging the text blocks.

Let me look at the available text blocks. There's 'baba', 'is', 'you' at the lower left. Then there are 'key', 'is', 'win' on the right. Also, 'wall', 'is', 'stop' near the upper left. So perhaps I can take the 'baba', 'is', 'you' and rearrange them. For example, move 'baba' to the door's position and make 'door is you', but the door isn't a text block. Wait, the door is an object, not a text block. So maybe I need to create a rule that involves the door.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I need to take the key to a certain location. But the key is already an object; perhaps I just need to move to it. But the path is blocked by walls. To get around the walls, maybe I can move the 'wall is stop' rule somewhere else. For example, move the 'stop' text block to make 'wall is', which would remove the stop property. Then walls would be passable.

Looking at the current setup: there's a rule 'wall is stop' at 4 step left and 2 step up. If I can move this rule by dragging the 'stop' text block away, then the rule would become 'wall is' (incomplete), which might deactivate 'wall is stop'. Then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how to do that? The player is Baba, who is you, so can move text blocks unless they're stop. But the text blocks here are not stop because the rule is 'wall is stop', but the text blocks themselves aren't stopped. Wait, the 'stop' property applies to objects, not text blocks. So text blocks can be moved unless they are part of a rule that makes them stop. But in this case, the 'stop' rule is for walls, not the text blocks. So I can move the text blocks 'wall', 'is', 'stop' around.

So the plan is: move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall is stop' rule to deactivate it. Then walls become passable. Once walls are passable, I can go around them to reach the key, pick it up (since key is win), and then perhaps the door becomes the win condition if I change that rule.

Alternatively, after making walls passable, go to the key at 5 right, 3 down, pick it, and since key is win, that would make me win. But I need to check if picking up the key is possible. In Baba Is You, sometimes you have to touch the object to collect it. So moving to the key's position and touching it would give me the key, making me win.

But the problem is the path to the key is blocked by walls. So if I can make walls passable by removing the 'stop' property, then I can move through them. Let's see the positions of the text blocks related to walls:

- 'wall' rule is at 4 step left and 2 step up.
- 'is' is at 3 step left and 2 step up.
- 'stop' is at 2 step left and 2 step up.

To deactivate 'wall is stop', I need to move one of these blocks. Maybe move the 'stop' block away. The 'stop' block is at 2 left, 2 up. If I move it down or right, the rule would no longer be complete. For example, moving 'stop' to 2 left, 3 up, then the rule would be 'wall is' which is invalid, so 'wall is stop' is deactivated.

Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. Then I can navigate to the key at 5 right, 3 down. From the current observation, the player's position isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the objects, maybe the player is near the left side, near the 'baba' rule. Let me assume the player is at position (0,0) for example.

To move to the key at 5 right, 3 down, I need to go right multiple times and down. But the path is blocked by walls on the right. If walls are passable after removing 'stop', then it's possible. However, moving the 'stop' block might require specific steps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is win, perhaps I need to bring the key to a specific location. But the key is already on the map. Maybe I just need to move to it. But again, the walls block the path.

Another angle: the door is at 6 right, 4 down. If I can change the win condition to door, then reaching the door would win. To do that, I need to create a 'door is win' rule. The existing 'key is win' is at 6 right, 2 up. Maybe I can move the 'win' block from the key rule to the door's position. For example, take the 'win' block at 7 right, 2 up and move it to the door's position at 6 right, 4 down. Then combine it with 'door' and 'is' to form 'door is win'.

But where is the 'door' text block? The door is an object, not a text block. So I can't create a 'door is win' rule unless there's a 'door' text block. Wait, in the current objects, there's a door at 6 steps right and 4 down, but no 'door' text block. So I can't directly make a rule about the door unless I have a 'door' text block. That seems like a problem.

Hmm. So maybe the intended solution is to pick up the key (since key is win) by moving to it, but overcoming the wall blockage. To do that, remove the 'stop' property from walls. So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'stop' text block away from the 'wall is stop' rule to deactivate it.
2. Then navigate through the now-passable walls to the key.
3. Pick up the key, which makes you win.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way. Let's check the positions again.

The 'stop' block is at 2 left, 2 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Since the player is likely near the 'baba' rule (at 3 left, 4 down), moving towards the 'stop' block would require going up and left. From the current observation, the player's position isn't specified, but based on the objects, perhaps the player is near the lower left area where the 'baba is you' rule is.

Assuming the player is at the 'baba' rule location (3 left, 4 down), moving up and left to reach the 'stop' block at 2 left, 2 up. The path would be: up twice, left once. But there might be walls in the way. Wait, the walls are to the right, so moving left should be clear.

Once the 'stop' block is moved, say to 2 left, 3 up, then the 'wall is' rule is broken, making walls passable. Then the player can move right through the walls to the key.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a position that can be reached by moving the 'win' block to the key. For example, the key is at 5 right, 2 down. The existing 'key is win' rule is at 4 right, 2 up. Maybe rearrange the 'key', 'is', 'win' blocks to say 'key is win' but in a different position so that the player can reach the key and activate the rule.

Wait, the rule 'key is win' is already active, so just being near the key should trigger the win condition. But maybe the key needs to be in a specific position relative to the player. Or perhaps the rule needs to be placed in a certain way.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Deactivate 'wall is stop' by moving the 'stop' block.
   - 'stop' is at 2 left, 2 up. Move it down to 2 left, 3 up.
   - This breaks the 'wall is stop' rule, making walls passable.

2. Navigate to the key at 5 right, 3 down.
   - From the player's position (assuming near 'baba' rule at 3 left, 4 down), move right four times and down three times. But the path to the right is blocked by walls. However, if walls are now passable, the player can move through them.

3. Once at the key, touch it to win, since 'key is win'.

Alternatively, after making walls passable, go around them and pick up the key.

Another possibility: If the player can create a new rule like 'baba is push', allowing them to push walls. To do that, find the 'baba', 'is', and 'push' text blocks. But 'push' isn't present in the current objects. The available text blocks are 'baba', 'is', 'you', 'key', 'win', 'wall', 'stop'.

So maybe create 'baba is push' by rearranging the existing blocks. But there's no 'push' block. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, create 'baba is key' or something, but that doesn't help with walls.

Back to the original idea: deactivate 'wall is stop', move through walls to key, pick it up to win.

So the actions needed would be:

- Move to the 'stop' block at 2 left, 2 up.
- Move 'stop' block down to 2 left, 3 up.
- Then move right through the walls to the key.

But how to move the 'stop' block? The player is Baba, who is you, so can move any text blocks unless they are stop. But the 'stop' property applies to objects, not text blocks. So the player can move the 'stop' block.

The 'stop' block is at 2 left, 2 up. The player's position is assumed to be near the 'baba' rule at 3 left, 4 down. To reach the 'stop' block, the player would need to move up twice and left once.

So the sequence would be:

1. Up (to move from 3 left, 4 down to 3 left, 3 down)
2. Up again (to 3 left, 2 down)
3. Left (to 2 left, 2 down)
4. Now adjacent to 'stop' block at 2 left, 2 up. Wait, directions might be different. Maybe the coordinates are relative. This part is a bit unclear without knowing the exact layout.

Alternatively, the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 step left and 3 steps down. So to get to the 'stop' block at 2 left, 2 up, the player needs to move right (towards less left) and up.

Assuming the player can move in directions relative to their current position, moving right once would take them to 2 left, 3 down. Then up twice to 2 left, 1 down. Then left? Not sure. This part is tricky without a visual layout.

Alternatively, perhaps the best course is to focus on moving the 'stop' block first. Once that's done, proceed to the key.

After moving 'stop', the player can navigate right through the walls, which are now passable, to reach the key. Then touch the key to win.

So the chosen action would be to move towards the 'stop' block and then move it. But the system requires a single action per step. So first, move to the 'stop' block's location, then either move it or proceed.

But given the observations, the latest observation shows that after some moves, the 'stop' block is now at 2 step left and 1 step up (from previous steps). Wait, looking at the current observation before the last action:

In the previous step, after moving left, the observation showed:

Objects on the map:
...
rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 1 step up

So the 'stop' block is now at 2 left, 1 up. To move it further, perhaps the player needs to move it down or right.

The goal is to move the 'stop' block away from the 'wall is stop' rule. The 'wall is stop' rule is composed of 'wall' at 4 left, 1 up; 'is' at 3 left, 1 up; 'stop' at 2 left, 1 up. So these three are connected to form the rule. To deactivate this rule, at least one of these blocks needs to be moved away.

If the 'stop' block is moved to 2 left, 2 up, then the rule is broken. So the action would be to move the 'stop' block down by one step.

To do that, the player needs to be adjacent to the 'stop' block. Assuming the player is near the 'baba' rule at 3 left, 4 down, moving up and right would position them to reach the 'stop' block.

But this requires multiple steps. However, the system requires choosing a single action each time. So the immediate action should be to move towards the 'stop' block or move the block itself.

In the current observation, the 'stop' block is at 2 left, 1 up. The player's position is not specified, but assuming they are nearby, perhaps moving right and up to get to the 'stop' block.

Alternatively, if the player is at 3 left, 4 down, moving up three steps and left once would reach the 'stop' block. But that's multiple moves. Since we can only do one action per turn, the best immediate action is to move in the general direction, say up, to get closer.

But perhaps the correct action now is to move the 'stop' block. Since the player is adjacent to it, the action would be to move the 'stop' block down to 2 left, 2 up.

In the previous steps, the user tried moving left, right, up, etc., but the system kept failing because the action wasn't correctly formatted. Now, the assistant needs to output the action in the specified format.

So, the correct action would be to move the 'stop' block down. The command to move a text block is to specify the direction, like 'move right' to move the block right.

Wait, but the available actions are idle, up, down, left, right. These are the player's movement actions. To move a text block, the player must be adjacent to it and then move in the direction, which would move the text block as well.

So, if the player is adjacent to the 'stop' block at 2 left, 1 up, and moves down, the 'stop' block would move down with them.

Assuming the player is positioned to the right or above the 'stop' block, moving left or up would move the block.

In the current observation, the 'stop' block is at 2 left, 1 up. The player's position is likely near the 'baba' rule at 3 left,","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are still ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". My goal is usually to reach the door, which is probably the ""win"" object. But right now, ""key is win"" means that grabbing the key makes me the win condition. So maybe I need to get the key to become the win object, then interact with it? Or maybe the door is the actual win, but the rule changed it. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the map, I see a key at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The door is at 6 steps right and 4 steps down. There's also a rule block for ""baba is you"", so I'm Baba. The walls are all labeled as stop, which means I can't move through them. 

So, my plan: I need to get to the key first because ""key is win"" means once I have the key, I become the win object. Then, I can probably step on the door or wherever the win condition is. Let me see where I am. The current position isn't specified, but maybe I'm at the original position of Baba. Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `baba`"" at 3 steps left and 4 steps down. Maybe that's where I start?

Wait, the problem is that the walls are blocking the path. From the observation, there are walls to the right at various positions. To reach the key at (5 right, 2 down), I need to move right and down, but there are walls in the way. Let's map out the path. 

Starting from my current position (assuming I'm at the Baba rule block at 3 left, 4 down), moving right would hit walls at 2 steps right and various downs. Maybe I need to move up first to avoid the walls. Let me check the walls again. 

There's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I go up from my position, maybe I can find a path. But the key is down, so perhaps I need to find a way around. Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the rules to make walls not stop. But ""wall is stop"" is a rule, so unless I change that, I can't go through walls. 

Wait, the key is at 5 right, 2 down. Let me see the path. From my position (3 left, 4 down), moving right 6 steps would get to the key's x-coordinate, but the y is different. Maybe I need to move down first. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I move down to 3 steps down, there's a wall there. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up to avoid the walls. Let's see: moving up from the current position (assuming it's the Baba rule block at 3 left,4 down) would take me to 3 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The objects show walls at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, so that's on the opposite side. Maybe moving up is clear. Let me try to navigate up. 

But the active rules are still ""wall is stop"", so I can't move into walls. So I have to find a path around them. Let me think. If I move up from my current position, then right, then down, maybe I can reach the key. Let's see:

Current position: maybe at Baba's rule block (3 left,4 down). Move up once to 3 left,3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at 2 steps right and various positions. So 3 left,3 down would be far left, which might not have a wall. Then move right towards the key. 

But the key is at 5 right,2 down. So moving right from 3 left to 5 right would require passing through 0,1,2,3,4,5 steps right. But there are walls at 2 steps right in several positions. For example, wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down. If I'm moving right from 3 left (which is -3?), maybe the coordinates are relative. This part is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the player is located at the ""baba"" text block. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 3 step to the left and 3 steps down. So if that's my position, moving right would be towards the center. The walls are at 2 steps right and various positions. So moving right from there would hit the wall at 2 steps right. So I can't go straight right. 

Maybe I need to move up first. From the ""baba"" rule block at 3 left,3 down, moving up to 3 left,2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So that's on the opposite side. So maybe that's clear. Then move right, avoiding the walls. 

But this is getting complicated. Let me focus on the key. The key is at 5 right,2 down. To get there, I need to move right and down, but avoid walls. Let's see the path:

From Baba's position (3 left,3 down):

1. Move up to 3 left,2 down. No wall here.
2. Move right to 2 left,2 down. Still clear.
3. Move right to 1 left,2 down. Clear.
4. Move right to 0 left (center),2 down. Clear.
5. Move right to 1 right,2 down. Check for walls. There's a wall at 2 right and 2 up, but that's up, not down. So maybe okay.
6. Move right to 2 right,2 down. Here's a wall at 2 right and 2 down. Can't go through.
7. So need to go around. Maybe move down first from 2 right,2 down to 2 right,3 down. But there's a wall at 2 right and 3 down. Can't. Alternatively, move up again? But already at 2 down. 

This path is blocked. Maybe another route. 

Alternative route:

From Baba's position (3 left,3 down):

1. Move down to 3 left,4 down. But that's where the door is, but there's a wall at 2 right and 4 down. So maybe not.
Wait, the door is at 6 right and 4 down. That's far. Maybe focus on getting the key first. 

Another idea: Since ""key is win"", maybe grabbing the key makes me the win object, so I can then stand on the door or something. So how to reach the key. The key is at 5 right,2 down. Let's see the path again. 

If I can move from 3 left,3 down (Baba's rule) to 5 right,2 down, avoiding walls. Let's plot the steps:

Right: need to move 8 steps right (from -3 to +5). But walls are at 2 right in several positions. So moving right past 2 right is blocked by walls at 2 right and various ys. 

Up or down? Maybe moving up first. From 3 left,3 down, move up to 3 left,2 down (no wall). Then right to 2 left,2 down. Right to 1 left,2 down. Right to 0 left,2 down. Right to 1 right,2 down. Right to 2 right,2 down (wall here). Can't. So maybe move down from 2 right,2 down to 2 right,3 down (wall there). Can't. 

Alternative: Move up to 3 left,1 down. Then right. 

From 3 left,3 down:

1. Up to 3 left,2 down.
2. Up to 3 left,1 down. Check for walls. Objects show wall at 2 right and 1 step up (which is 2 right,1 down from center?). Not sure. Maybe clear.
3. Move right to 2 left,1 down.
4. Right to 1 left,1 down.
5. Right to 0 left,1 down.
6. Right to 1 right,1 down.
7. Right to 2 right,1 down. Any wall? Objects list walls at 2 right and 2 step up (which would be 2 right, -1 down?), maybe not. So maybe clear.
8. Then down to 2 right,2 down (wall there). Can't. 

This is tricky. Maybe need to manipulate rules. The rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", ""baba is you"". If I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""stop is nothing"", then I could move through walls. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. 

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `stop`"" at 1 step left and 2 step up. So to change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is something else"", I need to move the ""is"" and ""stop"" blocks. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 4 left,1 up; ""is"" at 3 left,1 up; ""stop"" at 2 left,1 up. To break this rule, I need to move one of these blocks. Similarly, to create a new rule, like ""wall is push"", I need to create ""wall IS push"" by moving the relevant blocks. 

But how to move them? I am Baba, so I can move unless there's a STOP. Since walls are stop, I can't move into them, but I can move text blocks that are not stop. Wait, the rules say ""you"" is Baba, so I can move, but can only push objects that aren't stop. So if a text block is not defined as stop, I can move it. 

Looking at the current rules: ""wall is stop"" makes walls immovable. ""baba is you"" means I can move. ""key is win"" doesn't affect movability. So any text blocks that are not stop can be moved. The ""is"" and ""you"" and ""win"" blocks are probably not stop, so I can move them. 

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule to change ""wall is stop"" into something else, allowing me to pass through walls. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", which would let me move through them. 

To do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""stop"" parts of the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left,1 up; ""is"" at 3 left,1 up; ""stop"" at 2 left,1 up. So if I can move the ""is"" or ""stop"" block, I can break the rule. 

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""stop is push"" or ""wall is you"", but that might not help. 

Alternatively, create a rule that makes ""baba"" able to move through walls by redefining ""stop"". For example, ""stop is nothing"". 

To create ""stop is nothing"", I need the text blocks ""stop"", ""is"", ""nothing"". But looking at the current objects, there's no ""nothing"" text block. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", making walls be Baba, which I can move through. But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""stop"" in the original rule. 

Let me see the positions of the text blocks. The ""wall is stop"" rule components are:

- rule `wall` at 4 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` at 3 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `stop` at 2 step to the left and 1 step up

So to break this rule, I can move any of these three. Let's say I move the ""stop"" block. If I move it to a different position, the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken. Then walls would no longer be stop, and I could move through them. 

But how to move the ""stop"" block. I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. The ""stop"" block is at 2 left,1 up. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule block, which is 3 left,3 down. So the distance between me and the ""stop"" block is quite far. I would need to navigate there, but there are walls blocking the way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move other text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can create ""wall is push"", then I can move through walls. To do that, I need ""wall"", ""is"", ""push"". But there's no ""push"" block. 

Alternatively, use existing blocks. The ""key is win"" rule has ""key"", ""is"", ""win"". Maybe I can rearrange these to form a new rule. For example, ""win is key"", but that doesn't help. Or ""baba is win"", making me the win condition. 

If I can make ""baba is win"", then standing on the door or anywhere would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block from the ""key is win"" rule to pair with ""baba"" and ""is"". 

The ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right,2 up; ""is"" at 6 right,2 up; ""win"" at7 right,2 up. So the ""win"" block is there. If I can move the ""win"" block to be after ""baba"" and ""is"", forming ""baba is win"", that would work. 

But how to reach those blocks. My current position is at the ""baba"" rule block (3 left,3 down). The ""key is win"" rule is way to the right. There are walls blocking the path. Unless I can move through walls by changing the ""wall is stop"" rule, which loops back to the previous problem. 

This seems like a catch-22. I need to move text blocks to change rules, but I can't get past the walls without changing the rules. 

Alternative idea: Since the key makes me the win object when picked up, maybe I can reach the key by jumping over walls using other means. But the rules don't mention jumping. 

Wait, the possible actions are only idle, up, down, left, right. So no jumping. So I have to move around the walls. 

Let me try to find a path again. From Baba's position (3 left,3 down):

1. Move up to 3 left,2 down. Clear.
2. Move right to 2 left,2 down. Clear.
3. Move right to 1 left,2 down. Clear.
4. Move right to 0 left,2 down. Clear.
5. Move right to 1 right,2 down. Clear.
6. Move right to 2 right,2 down. Wall here. Can't move.
7. So instead, from 1 right,2 down, move down to 1 right,3 down. Is there a wall? Yes, wall at 2 right and 3 down. Can't.
8. Move up from 1 right,2 down to 1 right,1 down. Clear.
9. Move right to 2 right,1 down. Clear.
10. Move down to 2 right,2 down. Wall there. Can't.

This isn't working. Maybe another route. 

From 3 left,3 down:

1. Move down to 3 left,4 down. Door is at 6 right,4 down, but there's a wall at 2 right and4 down. Can't go through.
2. Move left? There's a wall at 4 step to the left and3 steps down, which is far left. Probably not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe I need to interact with the key's rule. The ""key is win"" rule is at 5 right,2 up. If I can move that rule to make me the win, but I can't reach it. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""baba is win"" by rearranging the existing blocks. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block from the key's rule to pair with ""baba"" and ""is"". 

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left,3 down. The ""is"" block for the baba rule is at 2 left,3 down. The ""you"" block is at1 left,3 down. 

If I can move the ""win"" block from the key's rule (7 right,2 up) to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", forming ""baba is win"". But the distance is too great. There are walls in between. 

This seems impossible without moving through walls, which I can't do because they're stop. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to push the walls. If I can change the rule to ""wall is push"", then I can move through them by pushing. But to create that rule, I need ""wall is push"". Do I have a ""push"" block? No. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, stop, baba, you. 

So ""push"" isn't present. Can't create that rule. 

Alternative approach: Since the key is win, maybe I just need to grab the key, which is at5 right,2 down. Even if there are walls, maybe I can move around them by finding a path. 

Let me try again to map the path. From Baba's position (3 left,3 down):

1. Move up to 3 left,2 down.
2. Move right to 2 left,2 down.
3. Move right to 1 left,2 down.
4. Move right to 0 left,2 down.
5. Move right to 1 right,2 down.
6. Move right to 2 right,2 down (wall here). Can't. So move down to 2 right,3 down (wall there). Can't.
7. Move up to 2 right,1 down.
8. Move right to 3 right,1 down.
9. Move down to3 right,2 down. Is there a wall? Yes, wall at2 right and2 down is nearby, but this is3 right,2 down. Not sure. The walls are listed at specific positions, so maybe clear.
10. Move right to4 right,2 down. Clear.
11. Move right to5 right,2 down. There's the key!

But wait, moving from3 right,2 down to4 right,2 down: are there walls? Looking at the objects, walls are at2 right and various positions, but","

20,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to reach the door, which is probably defined as ""win"" right now because the active rule says ""key is win"". But the key is down at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. So maybe I need to get the key first? Or maybe change the rules so that Baba becomes the win condition.

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"", so touching the key would make me win? Or does ""key is win"" mean that the key itself is the win object? The active rules also have ""baba is you"", so I'm controlling Baba. So if I can get to the key, since key is win, that would let me win. But the key is blocked by walls. Let's look at the map.

Looking at the objects, there are walls all around the right side. The key is at 5 right, 3 down. To get there, I might need to move down from my current position. But the path is blocked by walls. Wait, how am I positioned now? The observations don't specify my position, but the objects are relative. Maybe I'm at the starting point, which is near the left side? Let me assume I'm somewhere in the grid.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. If I can change ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba (myself) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" apart and create a new rule ""baba is win"". But how do I move the text blocks? The rules say I can only move objects or text that are not ""STOP"" or similar immovable properties. The current rules have ""wall is stop"", so walls can't be moved. The text blocks for the rules might not be stop, so I can move them.

Looking at the objects, the rule `key` is at 5 right, 2 step up. The `is` next to it, then `win`. So the rule ""key is win"" is formed by those three. To break this rule, I need to move one of them. For example, move the `win` text block far away so the rule is broken. Then, I can create a new rule ""baba is win"" using the `baba`, `is`, and `win` text blocks from the other side.

On the left side, there's a rule `wall` at 3 left, 1 up, then `is` and `stop`. The `baba` rule is at 3 left, 4 down, with `is` and `you`. So the ""baba is you"" rule is there. To make ""baba is win"", I need to take the `win` text block (which is originally part of ""key is win"") and attach it to `baba` and `is`.

So the plan is: move the `win` text block from the ""key is win"" rule to the area near `baba` and `is`, then combine them to form ""baba is win"". That way, touching Baba (myself) would make me win. Then I can just stand still and win.

But how to move the `win` block? The `win` is at 7 right, 2 step up. To get there, I need to navigate through the walls. But the path might be blocked. Alternatively, maybe I can move other text blocks out of the way. The `is` next to `key` is at 6 right, 2 step up. If I can move that `is` block to the left, then maybe I can rearrange the ""key is win"" rule.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to first move the `win` text block from the ""key is win"" rule to the area with `baba`, `is`, and `you`. Once I do that, I can form ""baba is win"". Let's see the positions:

Original ""key is win"" rule:
- `key` at 5 right, 2 up
- `is` at 6 right, 2 up
- `win` at 7 right, 2 up

The `baba`, `is`, `you` rule is at:
- `baba` at 3 left, 4 down
- `is` at 2 left, 4 down
- `you` at 1 left, 4 down

So the `win` block is on the right side, 7 right, 2 up. To get it to the left side where `baba` is, I need to move it left across the grid. But there are walls on the right side. Let's check the path from 7 right, 2 up to 3 left, 4 down. That's a long way. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` block down first. The `win` is at 7 right, 2 up. Moving down one step would be to 7 right, 3 up. Is that possible? Are there walls there? Looking at the objects, at 2 steps right and 3 steps down there's a wall, but that's further down. The immediate vicinity of 7 right, 2 up: are there any walls adjacent? The observation shows walls at 2 steps right and various positions, but not immediately around 7 right, 2 up. So maybe I can move the `win` block down to 7 right, 3 up, then left towards the `baba` area.

But how do I move the `win` block? I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. Since I'm controlling Baba, and the rules are ""baba is you"", I can move. The `win` block is a text block, so if it's not stopped by any ""STOP"" rule, I can move it. The current rules don't make text blocks stop, only walls. So yes, I can move the `win` block.

So step by step:

1. Move from current position (assumed to be near the starting point, perhaps 0,0) towards the `win` block at 7 right, 2 up. But need to navigate around walls.

Wait, but the initial observations don't specify my position. This is a problem. Maybe I need to assume my position based on the objects. Alternatively, perhaps the key is at 5 right, 2 down, which is lower. Wait, in the latest observation, the key is at 5 right, 3 steps down. Let me check the latest observation:

In the last observation before the current one, the key is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. Then after moving left, the key's position might have changed. Wait, the current observation shows the key at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should focus on the latest observation provided.

In the current observation, the key is at 5 right, 3 down. The door is at 6 right, 4 down. The `baba` rule is at 3 left, 4 down. The `win` text block is at 7 right, 2 up. The `is` next to `key` is at 6 right, 2 up. The `key` is at 5 right, 2 up. Wait, no, in the current observation, the `key` is at 5 steps right and 2 step up. The `win` is at 7 right, 2 up. So the ""key is win"" rule is horizontally aligned at 5,6,7 right and 2 up.

To break this rule, I need to move at least one of these text blocks. Let's say I move the `win` block from 7 right, 2 up to, say, 3 left, 4 down where the `baba` is. Then I can create ""baba is win"".

To move the `win` block, I have to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The `win` is at 7 right, 2 up. Where am I located? The observation doesn't say, but assuming I'm near the `baba` rules on the left. Alternatively, I might be near the starting point.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `win` block down to 7 right, 3 up, then left to 6 right, 3 up, etc., until I reach the area with `baba`. But there might be walls blocking the path. Looking at the objects, at 2 steps right and 3 steps down there's a wall, but that's further down. The immediate area around 7 right, 2 up: are there walls? The observation lists walls at 2 steps right and various positions, but not at 7 right, 2 up. So perhaps I can move the `win` block down to 7 right, 3 up, then left to 6 right, 3 up, then down to 6 right, 2 down, etc. But this requires navigating carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I can first break the ""key is win"" rule by moving the `is` block. The `is` is at 6 right, 2 up. If I move that to the left, then the rule is broken. Then I can take the `key` and `win` blocks and form a new rule.

But the goal is to become the win condition. So forming ""baba is win"" is better. To do that, I need to get the `win` block next to `baba` and `is`.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the `win` block from 7 right, 2 up to the area near `baba` at 3 left, 4 down.

To move the `win` block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Let's see the coordinates:

Current `win` position: 7 right, 2 up.

To get to the `baba` area: 3 left, 4 down.

That's a significant distance. Let's think of a path. From 7 right, 2 up, moving leftwards:

7 right â†’ 6 right, 2 up (but there's a `key` at 5 right, 2 up, so maybe moving left from 7 right would hit the `key` block? Wait, the `key` is at 5 right, 2 up. So the `win` is at 7 right, 2 up, then `is` at 6 right, 2 up, then `key` at 5 right, 2 up. So the `win` is to the right of the `is`, which is to the right of the `key`. So to move the `win` block left, I need to first move it left past the `is` block. But the `is` is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I move the `win` left, the rule remains intact as long as `key`, `is`, `win` are in order.

Wait, the rules are formed by consecutive text blocks. So ""key is win"" is key + is + win. If I move the `win` to the left, it would become key + is + win, but that's still the same rule. To break the rule, I need to separate them. So perhaps moving the `win` block down or up.

Alternatively, move the `is` block to break the rule. If I move the `is` block from 6 right, 2 up to somewhere else, then the ""key is win"" rule is broken. Then I can create a new rule.

But the goal is to make ""baba is win"". So perhaps breaking the old rule and creating a new one is better.

Let me try this approach:

1. Move the `is` block from 6 right, 2 up to, say, 4 right, 2 up. This would break the ""key is win"" rule.

2. Then, take the `baba`, `is`, and `win` blocks to form ""baba is win"".

But how to move the `is` block? I need to be adjacent to it. The `is` is at 6 right, 2 up. Where am I? If I'm controlling Baba, and assuming I'm near the `baba` rule on the left, maybe I need to navigate to the `is` block at 6 right, 2 up.

This is getting complicated without knowing my exact position. Maybe I should focus on moving the `win` block first.

Alternatively, another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I can pick up the key and bring it to the door. But the key is at 5 right, 3 down, and the door is at 6 right, 4 down. The path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the objects around there.

Looking at the current observation, the objects around the key (5 right, 3 down) are:

- wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down
- wall at 2 steps right and 4 steps down
- door at 6 right, 4 steps down
- rule `baba` at 3 left, 4 steps down
- etc.

The key is at 5 right, 3 down. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and various positions. Wait, the walls are mostly on the right side. The key is further to the right. Maybe I can move right past the walls.

But without knowing my position, it's hard to say. Maybe I should try to move towards the key first. If I can get the key, since key is win, touching it would make me win. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From the key's position (5 right, 3 down), to reach the door (6 right, 4 down), I need to move right and down. But there's a wall at 2 steps right and 3 steps down, which is not in the way. Wait, the walls on the right side are at 2 steps right and various downs. The key is at 5 right, 3 down. So moving right from there would be to 6 right, 3 down, but is there a wall there? The observation lists walls at 2 steps right and 1,2,3 steps down, and 2 steps right and 4 steps down. So at 6 right, 3 down, there's no wall mentioned. So maybe I can move right from the key to 6 right, 3 down, then down to 6 right, 4 down (the door).

But to get to the key at 5 right, 3 down, I need to move from my current position. Assuming I'm near the `baba` area on the left, maybe I can move right towards the key.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the rules to make Baba the win. Since ""baba is you"", if I can make ""baba is win"", then just staying in place would win the game.

To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks. The `win` block is at 7 right, 2 up. The `baba` block is at 3 left, 4 down. The `is` block is at 2 left, 4 down. So I need to move the `win` block to the area near `baba` and `is`.

The path for the `win` block would be from 7 right, 2 up â†’ move left to 6 right, 2 up (but there's an `is` at 6 right, 2 up), so can't move left directly. Need to move the `is` block out of the way first.

So step by step:

1. Move the `is` block from 6 right, 2 up to, say, 5 right, 2 up. This would break the ""key is win"" rule.

2. Now, the `win` block is at 7 right, 2 up. Move it left to 6 right, 2 up (now empty), then 5 right, 2 up, then 4 right, 2 up, etc., until reaching the area near `baba`.

3. Once the `win` block is near `baba` and `is` (which was moved), combine them to form ""baba is win"".

This requires careful movement of the text blocks. Each move would involve pushing the block in a direction. For example, to move the `is` block from 6 right, 2 up to 5 right, 2 up, I need to be adjacent to it and move left.

But again, without knowing my position, it's hard to determine the exact steps. Maybe I should focus on moving the `win` block first.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. If I can pick up the `win` block and place it next to `baba` and `is`, forming ""baba is win"". Let's try:

- Move down from the `win` block at 7 right, 2 up to 7 right, 3 up.

- Then move left to 6 right, 3 up.

- Then move down to 6 right, 2 down.

- Continue moving left and down until reaching the `baba` area.

But I need to check if there are walls in the way. The observation shows walls at 2 steps right and various positions, but not in the path from 7 right, 2 up to 3 left, 4 down. So maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to move the `win` block down to 7 right, 3 up, then left to 6 right, 3 up, then down to 6 right, 2 down, then left to 5 right, 2 down, etc., until reaching the `baba` area.

Once the `win` block is placed next to `baba` and `is`, the new rule ""baba is win"" is created, making me win by just standing there.

So the chosen action would be to move the `win` block down first. The action to move the `win` block would be to push it down from its current position. Since the `win` block is at 7 right, 2 up, moving down would require the agent (Baba) to be to the north of the `win` block and move down, pushing it.

But how to represent this in the action? The allowed actions are idle, up, right, down, left. So to move the `win` block down, the agent needs to be adjacent to it and move in the direction opposite to the push. Wait, in Baba Is You, when you push an object, you move in the direction you're facing, and the object moves in the opposite direction. For example, if you're facing north and move down (south), the object you're pushing moves north.

So to move the `win` block down (south), the agent must be north of the `win` block and move down. So the agent would move","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to get to the door, which is normally blocked by walls, but the active rules say ""key is win"". So the key is acting as the win condition. But there's a key on the map. Maybe I need to get the key first?

Looking at the current position, I'm probably the Baba object since ""baba is you"". The walls are stop, so I can't move into them. The key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. The door is further right at 6 steps right and 4 steps down, but there's a wall there. Wait, the door's position is 6 right and 4 down. Let me check the objects around there.

The key is at 5 right, 3 down. So to get there, I need to move right and down. But the path might be blocked. Let's see the map structure. From the current position (assumed to be at 2 right), moving right would take me towards the key. But there are walls at 2 right, 1 up; 2 right, 1 step up; etc. Maybe I need to navigate around the walls.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop. So touching the key would make me win? Or does the key becoming the win condition mean that reaching the key is the win? The original goal might have been to reach the door, but now the key is the win. So maybe I need to go to the key instead of the door.

But the key is at 5 right, 3 down. How to get there? Let's look at the path. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe 2 right, 2 up?), moving right to get to the key's x-coordinate (5 right) would require moving right multiple times, but there are walls at 2 right, 1 step up, etc. Wait, the walls are positioned at various steps. Let me parse the objects again.

The walls are at 2 right and 3 step up, 2 right and 2 step up, 2 right and 1 step up, etc., going down. The key is at 5 right, 2 steps down. So between me (assuming position 0,0) and the key, there's a wall at 2 right. So I need to find a way around. Maybe by moving up past the walls?

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. Since the rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can change the rule ""wall is stop"" to something else, like making walls passable, that would help. But to do that, I need to move the text blocks that make up the rules.

Looking at the rules on the map: there's a rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 1 step up, followed by `is` and `stop`. So the rule ""wall is stop"" is formed by those three text blocks. If I can move those, I could change the property of wall. But can I move them? The rule says ""wall is stop"", so any object that is stop can't be moved. Wait, the active rules include ""wall is stop"", which means walls have the stop property, making them immovable. So I can't move the wall itself, but maybe I can move the text blocks that define the rule.

The text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are at positions: rule `wall` 3 left 1 up, rule `is` 2 left 1 up, rule `stop` 1 left 1 up. These are three separate text blocks forming the rule. Since the rule is ""wall is stop"", which makes walls stop. But if I can move these text blocks, I could change the rule. For example, moving them to form ""stop is wall"", but that might not help. Alternatively, removing the ""stop"" property from wall.

But the problem is that the agent (Baba) is you, and to move text blocks, they must not be defined as stop. Are the text blocks themselves stop? The rules are about the properties of objects. The text blocks are part of the level's structure. Unless there's a rule that says text blocks are stop, which there isn't here. So maybe I can move the text blocks.

So the idea is to move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, thereby changing the definition of what is stop. For example, moving the ""stop"" text block to another part to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's see the positions of the rule components:

- rule `wall` is 3 steps left and 1 step up.
- rule `is` is 2 steps left and 1 step up.
- rule `stop` is 1 step left and 1 step up.

These form the rule ""wall is stop"". To break this rule, I need to separate these text blocks. For example, move the ""stop"" block away so that the rule is no longer complete. Once the rule is broken, walls might no longer be stop, allowing me to move through them.

But how to move these text blocks? The agent is Baba, which is you. So as long as the objects I'm trying to move aren't stop, I can move them. Since the text blocks aren't marked as stop (unless there's another rule), I can probably push them.

The ""stop"" text block is at 1 left, 1 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction that pushes it. But I need to check if there's anything blocking its movement. Looking at the objects around that area:

- rule `wall` is 3 left 1 up.
- rule `is` is 2 left 1 up.
- rule `stop` is 1 left 1 up.

So the ""stop"" block is to the right of the ""is"" block. To move the ""stop"" block, I would need to be next to it and push it. But where am I located? The initial position isn't specified, but based on the objects, perhaps the agent is at the starting point, which might be at 2 right, 3 steps up or another position. This is a bit unclear without the visual map, but maybe the agent is near the ""baba"" rule blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba` at 4 step left and 3 steps down, followed by `is` and `you`. So the ""baba is you"" rule is formed there. Maybe the agent is at the position of the Baba object, which is part of that rule. So the agent's position is likely at 4 left, 3 down, but that's speculative.

Assuming the agent is near the ""baba"" rule, to reach the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 1 up, the agent would need to move left and up. But there might be walls blocking the path. Alternatively, maybe the agent can move horizontally to reach the text blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to first reach the key. Since the key is win, touching it would make the agent win. The key is at 5 right, 3 down. The path to the key is blocked by walls at 2 right. So how to get around that? If walls are stop, can't move through them. Unless we can change the wall's property.

So the plan is: either move the ""stop"" text block to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule, making walls passable, then go around them to the key. Or, manipulate another rule to make the key the win condition, which it already is. But the key is win, so touching it should win the level. So maybe the path is clear once we can move through walls.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", so touching the key makes you win. So the goal is to reach the key. The key is at 5 right, 3 down. The agent is probably at the starting position, maybe near the ""baba is you"" rule. Let's see the positions again:

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 left, 3 down. So the agent (Baba) is likely at that position. So to get to the key at 5 right, 3 down, the agent needs to move right from 4 left to 5 right? Wait, directions can be confusing. Assuming the agent's position is at 4 left, 3 down, to move right would decrease the left steps. So moving right once would be 3 left, 3 down, etc. But the key is at 5 right and 3 down. So the agent is at 4 left, 3 down, and the key is at 5 right, 3 down. The distance is 4 left to 5 right, which is 9 steps to the right. But there are walls at 2 right, which is much closer.

This seems too far. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system. The observations list objects relative to the agent's position. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right"" means 2 steps east from the agent. So if the agent is at position (0,0), a wall 2 steps to the right is at (2,0). The key is at (5, 3 down), which would be (5, -3). The door is at (6, -4).

The active rules are key is win, so reaching the key at (5,-3) should win. But the path there is blocked by walls at (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), etc., going down to (2,-3). So from the agent's position (assuming (0,0)), moving right to (2,0) is a wall. Can't go through. Maybe need to go around.

Alternatively, if we can move the ""stop"" rule to make walls passable. To do that, we need to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" block is at ( -1, 1 ) if the agent is at (0,0) (since it's 1 step to the left and 1 step up). To move it, the agent needs to be adjacent and push it. So from (0,0), moving left and up to (-1,1), but is that possible? Are there walls blocking that path?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 3 step left and 1 step up, which would be (-3,1). Then rule `is` at (-2,1), and rule `stop` at (-1,1). So the agent is at (0,0), and to reach (-1,1), there's nothing blocking except the rule blocks themselves. So the agent can move left and up to (-1,1), push the ""stop"" block. But can the agent move there?

The agent is Baba, which is you, and the only stop objects are walls. The text blocks (rules) aren't marked as stop, so they can be moved. So moving left to (-1,0), then up to (-1,1), then push the ""stop"" block to the left or up. For example, push it left to (-2,1), which would break the ""wall is stop"" rule into ""wall is "" and ""is stop"", which is invalid. Then walls would no longer be stop, allowing the agent to move through them.

Once walls are passable, the agent can go around the walls to the key. So the steps would be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" text block at (-1,1).
2. Push it left to (-2,1), breaking the rule.
3. Now walls are not stop, so move right through them to the key.

Alternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. If the agent can move the ""key is win"" rule to make itself win, but that might not be necessary since the key is already win.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe the agent can pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is at (5,-3), and the agent is at (0,0). The path is blocked by walls. Unless we can move the walls by changing their rule.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to a different position, making walls not stop. For example, moving the ""wall"" text block to another location. The ""wall"" text block is at (-3,1). If we move it, say, to the right, then the rule would be incomplete, so walls wouldn't be stop.

But moving the ""wall"" text block would require being adjacent to it. The agent is at (0,0). To get to (-3,1), the agent would need to move left three times and up once, but there are other rules in the way. The ""is"" text block is at (-2,1), and ""stop"" at (-1,1). So the path to (-3,1) is blocked by the ""wall"" rule's own components. Unless the agent can navigate around them.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline the possible steps:

1. Reach the ""stop"" text block at (-1,1) to modify the rule.
   - Move from (0,0) â†’ (-1,0) â†’ (-1,1).
2. Push the ""stop"" block to (-2,1), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now walls are not stop, so move right through them to the key.
   - From (0,0) go right to (2,0) (which was a wall but now passable), then continue right to (5,-3) to get the key.

But how to move from (0,0) to (-1,1):

- Move left once to (-1,0).
- Move up once to (-1,1).
- Now, push the ""stop"" block. To push it left, the agent needs to be to the right of it. So from (-1,1), move left to (-2,1), but the ""stop"" block is at (-1,1). To push it, the agent would need to be adjacent and move in the direction opposite to where the block is. Wait, in Baba Is You, to push an object, you have to move towards it. For example, if the agent is to the left of the ""stop"" block, moving right would push the block to the right.

So if the agent is at (-1,1), adjacent to the ""stop"" block at (-1,1), moving left would push the ""stop"" block to (-2,1). Wait, no. The direction of movement determines the push. If the agent is at (-1,1) and moves left (to (-2,1)), the ""stop"" block would be pushed to (-2,1) as well? Or does the agent have to be next to the block and move in a direction that pushes it.

Actually, in Baba Is You, you push blocks by moving towards them. So if the agent is to the left of the block and moves left, the block stays. To push the block to the left, the agent needs to move right, which would push the block left. Wait, no. Let me think. If the agent is at position A and the block is at position B, and the agent wants to push the block to the left, the agent needs to move towards the block from the right, i.e., move left into the block's position, causing the block to move left.

So in this case, the agent is at (-1,1), and the ""stop"" block is also at (-1,1). That can't be right. Wait, no, the ""wall"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at (-3,1), ""is"" at (-2,1), ""stop"" at (-1,1). So the agent is at (0,0), and to reach the ""stop"" block at (-1,1), the agent needs to move left three times and up once. But there's a wall at (2,0) which is stop, but if we haven't changed the rule yet, the agent can't move through walls.

This seems impossible because the agent is starting at (0,0), and the ""stop"" block is at (-1,1), which is behind a wall at (2,0) in the other direction. There's a contradiction here. Maybe my assumption about the agent's starting position is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent's starting position is near the ""baba is you"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 step left and 4 steps down, which would be (-3, -4) if the agent is at (0,0). So the agent is at (-3, -4), and the ""baba"" text block is at (-3, -4), then ""is"" at (-2, -4), ""you"" at (-1, -4). To reach the ""stop"" block at (-1,1), the agent would have to move right and up, but there are walls in the way.

This is getting too confusing without seeing the actual map layout. Maybe I should focus on the immediate objects around the agent. The key is at 5 right and 3 down. The door is at 6 right and 4 down. The agent needs to reach the key. Assuming the agent can move right and down, but blocked by walls. The only way is to remove the wall's stop property.

So the priority is to modify the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step left and 1 step up from the agent's current position. If the agent can move there and push the ""stop"" block, that would break the rule.

Assuming the agent's current position is such that moving left and up is possible, the steps would be:

1. Move left to reach the ""stop"" block.
2. Push the ""stop"" block away, breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, move freely through walls to the key.

But how to move to the ""stop"" block if there are walls in the way. For example, if the agent is at (0,0) and the ""stop"" block is at (-1,1), but there's a wall at (2,0), which is in the opposite direction. This suggests that the agent's starting position might be elsewhere.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe the agent can pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is behind walls. Unless the agent can move the walls by changing their rule.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can create a new rule that makes ""baba"" win, but the active rule is already ""key is win"". So touching the key is necessary.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, perhaps the correct action now is to move right towards the key, assuming that the walls are no longer stop after modifying the rule. But how to ensure that.

Wait, the latest observation shows that after previous actions, the walls might have changed. The previous actions included moving right and left","

Let me try to figure this out. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, normally, I would be Baba because of ""baba is you"". The goal is to get to the door, which is probably acting as the win condition, but the current rule says key is win, so maybe I need to get the key first?

Looking at the objects, the key is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down from me. But there are walls around it. The walls are defined as stop, so I can't move through them. The door is at 6 steps right and 4 steps down. How do I get there?

Wait, the key is win, so maybe picking up the key changes something? If I take the key, does that make me win? But the rule says key is win, so maybe once I have the key, I can win by reaching the door? Or perhaps I need to move the key to the door? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite the rules. The rules are made up of text blocks. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. If I can move the ""is win"" text next to the door, then door would become win. That way, reaching the door would be the solution. But the problem is that the rules are spread out. Let me check their positions.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 right, 2 up. The ""win"" part is at 7 right, 2 up. So to make door win, I need to move ""is win"" to be next to door. The door is at 6 right, 4 down. Hmm, maybe I need to move the ""win"" text from the key to the door. But how?

First, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 2 up, and ""win"" is at 7 right, 2 up. To create ""door is win"", I need to get ""is"" next to door and ""win"" next to door. But the door is far to the right and down. There are walls blocking the path. The walls are all to the right except for some down.

Wait, maybe the key is at 5 right, 3 down. So if I go down to get the key, but the path is blocked by walls. Let me see. From my current position (assuming I'm Baba's position, which is probably at 1 right, maybe?), but the exact position isn't clear. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 right, 2 up. The key is at 5 right, 2 down. So maybe I need to move down towards the key. But the walls are in the way. There's a wall at 2 right, 3 down, and others. Maybe I can push the walls if they are not stop. Wait, the rule says wall is stop, so I can't move through them. So I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can move ""baba is you"" to become ""baba is win"", then I could be the win object. But how to do that. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 4 down. ""is"" is at 2 left, 4 down, and ""you"" is at 1 left, 4 down. To make ""baba is win"", I need to replace ""you"" with ""win"". But those text blocks are separate. So I would have to move the ""you"" rule away and place ""win"" next to ""baba is"".

But to do that, I need to move the ""you"" text block. The ""you"" is at 1 left, 4 down. If I can move it left or right, then maybe I can place the ""win"" text there. The ""win"" text is at 7 right, 2 up. That's far away. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So currently, I am you (Baba), and the key is the win object. So if I can get the key, maybe that makes me win? But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks but not objects like the key unless you're a specific object. Since I'm you (Baba), and the key is win, maybe touching the key makes me win? Or maybe I need to move the key to the door?

Alternatively, the door is probably the exit, but it's behind walls. The door is at 6 right, 4 down. There's a wall at 2 right, 4 down. So unless I can destroy the wall or change its rule, I can't get through. The rule for wall is stop, so if I can change that rule, maybe wall becomes passable.

To change the wall's rule, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" text. The ""wall"" part is at 3 left, 1 up, ""is"" at 2 left, 1 up, and ""stop"" at 1 left, 1 up. If I can rearrange these to make something else, like ""stop is wall"" or ""wall is nothing"", that might help. But how to move them.

The problem is that I'm possibly surrounded by walls. Let me think about the movement. If I'm at a certain position, maybe I can move left or right to access the text blocks. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 left, 4 down. If I can move left to get to those text blocks, I could rearrange them.

But the door is to the right, and the key is also to the right. Maybe the solution is to first get the key, which is win, and then use that to open the door. But how does the key help? If key is win, maybe having the key in your possession makes you win. In Baba Is You, sometimes holding an object makes you that object. So if I am you (Baba) and I hold the key (win), then maybe I become win, allowing me to pass through the door?

But I don't know the exact mechanics here. Alternatively, the door might be a win condition, but the rule says key is win. So perhaps the key needs to be at the door to trigger the win condition. So I need to move the key to the door's location.

But how to move the key. The key is a static object unless you can push it. But in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks, not regular objects like the key. So maybe the key can't be moved, but the text blocks can be rearranged to change the rules.

Wait, the active rules are key is win. If I can change that rule to door is win, then going to the door would win. To do that, I need to move the ""is win"" text to be next to door. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 2 up, and ""win"" is at 7 right, 2 up. The door is at 6 right, 4 down. So I need to move these ""is"" and ""win"" blocks down and right.

But how to move them. Since I'm Baba (you), and the only movable things are the text blocks that aren't stopped. The text blocks are not stopped unless they are part of a stop rule. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So the text blocks for these rules can be moved unless they are part of a stop rule. Since ""stop"" is a property of wall, the text blocks for the rules can be moved.

So I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" from the key rule to the door's location. Let's see. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 2 up. To get to the door at 6 right, 4 down, I need to move down 2 steps and right 0. But the ""is"" is already at 6 right. So maybe move the ""is"" down to 6 right, 4 down, and then place ""win"" next to it.

But how to move the ""is"" block. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push text blocks unless they are stopped. The ""is"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, but since the rule is active, maybe it's not stopped. So I can move the ""is"" block. Let's say I move the ""is"" block down two steps to reach the door's row (4 down). Then place the ""win"" block next to it to make ""door is win"".

But first, I need to access the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks. The ""is"" is at 6 right, 2 up, and ""win"" is at 7 right, 2 up. To get there, I might need to move right from my current position. But there are walls blocking the path. The wall at 2 right, 2 up is probably preventing me from moving right. Unless I can push that wall, but it's a stop rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing rules. The ""baba is you"" rule is at 3 left, 4 down. If I can move ""baba"" to be next to ""door"", then create ""door is you"" or ""door is win"". But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the key to the door. But since the key is a regular object, not a text block, I can't push it. So that's not possible.

Wait, another thought: if I can make the wall not a stop. If I change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""stop is wall"", then walls would be stop properties of something else, maybe nothing. But how to do that. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block to another part, like making ""stop is push"" or something, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore.

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. Let's see. The ""wall"" part of the rule is at 3 left, 1 up. ""is"" at 2 left, 1 up. ""stop"" at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move the ""stop"" block to another location, say next to ""wall"" but as ""stop is"" something else.

But this seems complicated. Maybe the priority is to get to the key first. To reach the key at 5 right, 2 down, I need to move down from my current position. Let's assume I'm at the original starting point, which might be near the ""baba"" text block. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 4 down. So maybe I'm at that position. To move down to the key, I need to go right and down, but there are walls in the way.

Looking at the wall positions: wall at 2 right, 2 up; wall at 2 right, 1 up; wall at 2 right; wall at 2 right, 1 down; 2 right, 2 down; 2 right, 3 down. So the path to the key at 5 right, 2 down is blocked by walls on the right side. Unless I can go around via the left side.

The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 4 down. So if I move left from there, maybe I can access the text blocks on the left. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. ""is"" at 2 left, 1 up. ""stop"" at 1 left, 1 up. If I can move those text blocks to change the wall rule.

For example, if I move ""stop"" to be next to ""baba"", making ""baba is stop"", then Baba would be stop, making me unable to move. Not good.

Alternatively, move ""wall"" to be next to ""door"", making ""door is wall"", but I don't have a door rule yet.

This is getting too complicated. Let's think step by step.

Current active rules:
- key is win: So touching the key makes me win?
- wall is stop: Can't move through walls.
- baba is you: I am Baba.

Goals:
- Reach the door, which is probably the exit, but the rule says key is win, so maybe need the key first.

Possible actions:
1. Move towards the key to pick it up.
2. Rearrange text blocks to change the win condition to door.
3. Remove the stop property from walls to bypass them.

Let's try the first option. To get to the key at 5 right, 2 down. My current position is probably near the ""baba"" rule at 3 left, 4 down. So to move right towards the key, I need to go right 6 steps, but there are walls at 2 right. That's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the walls if they are not stop. But the rule says wall is stop, so they are immovable.

Wait, maybe the walls are only stop if they are labeled as wall. If I can change the wall's rule to something else, like ""rock is stop"", then the existing walls would no longer be stop. But how to do that.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 left, 1 up. If I can move the ""wall"" text block to another location, say next to ""rock"", but there's no rock mentioned. Alternatively, move ""stop"" to another part, making ""wall is something else"".

For example, if I move the ""stop"" block to be next to ""key"", making ""key is stop"", but that would make the key stop, which is bad.

Alternatively, move ""is"" from ""wall is stop"" to connect with another rule. Like, making ""wall is you"" or something. But that might make walls you, which is also bad.

This is tricky. Maybe the best bet is to focus on changing the win condition to door. The door is at 6 right, 4 down. The current ""key is win"" rule is at 6 right, 2 up. The ""is"" and ""win"" blocks are there. If I can move those down to the door's location.

To move the ""is"" block from 6 right, 2 up to 6 right, 4 down (same column, down 2 steps). Then place the ""win"" block next to it to make ""door is win"".

But to do that, I need to move the ""is"" block down. Since I'm Baba (you), I can push text blocks unless they are stopped. The ""is"" block is part of the ""key is win"" rule, which is active, but I think text blocks can be moved as long as they're not part of a ""stop"" rule. Since ""is"" is just a connector, it can be moved.

So step by step:
1. Move down from the current position to reach the ""is"" block at 6 right, 2 up.
2. Push the ""is"" block down two steps to 6 right, 4 down.
3. Then move the ""win"" block from 7 right, 2 up to 7 right, 4 down (next to the new ""is"" block), forming ""door is win"".

This way, the door becomes the win condition, and I can just walk into it.

But how to execute this movement. Let's see the map again. The ""is"" block is at 6 right, 2 up. To get there, I might need to move right from my current position. But there's a wall at 2 right, 2 up. So unless I can move that wall, which I can't because it's stop, I can't get past.

Wait, maybe my current position is not where I think. Let me try to visualize the map based on the objects.

Assuming the player is at a starting position, maybe near the ""baba"" rule. The ""baba"" rule is at 3 left, 4 down. So if I'm there, to move right, I have to go through 3 left to 0 left, then right to 6 right? But there are walls at 2 right, which block the path.

This is getting too confusing without a visual. Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to the door's location by navigating around the walls.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe picking up the key allows me to win by standing on it. So I need to reach the key.

To reach the key at 5 right, 2 down, perhaps I can move down from the ""baba"" rule's position. Let's assume I'm at 3 left, 4 down. To move down, I go to 3 left, 5 down. But are there walls there? The objects list shows walls at 2 right, various positions, but not at 3 left, down.

Wait, the objects are listed as:

- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- rule `key` 5 steps to the right and 2 step up
- etc.

So relative positions. Maybe the player's starting position is at (0,0), and all other positions are relative to that.

So, for example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"" would be at (2,3).

Assuming that, the player's position is probably at (0,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (-3, -4) (3 steps left, 4 steps down).

The key is at (5, 2). The door is at (6,4).

The walls are at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (2,-1), (2,-2), (2,-3).

So the path from (0,0) to (5,2) is blocked by a wall at (2,3), (2,2), etc. So I can't go straight right.

Alternative path: go around the left. From (0,0), move left to (-1,0), (-2,0), etc., but there are no walls mentioned on the left except the ""baba"" rule at (-3,-4). So maybe moving left is possible.

If I go left to (-1,0), then perhaps access the text blocks on the left. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-3,1). So to get there, I need to move left 3 steps and up 1. But from (0,0), left 3 steps is (-3,0), then up 1 to (-3,1). There's a wall at (-3,1) as part of the ""wall is stop"" rule. But since it's a text block, I","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So right now, the key becomes the win object, meaning grabbing the key would make me win? Or does ""key is win"" change the win condition to the key? So maybe touching the key is the way to win. But there's also a door on the map. Normally, doors might need to be opened, but the current rules don't mention anything about doors. Maybe the key is the win object, so I need to get to the key.

Looking at the objects, I'm probably the Baba entity since ""baba is you"" makes me controllable. My current position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the objects listed, I might be at the starting point. Let's see the walls: there's a wall 2 steps to the right and various directions. The key is at 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down from my current position. The door is further to the right, at 6 steps right and 4 steps down.

But I need to navigate past walls that are marked as stop. Since wall is stop, I can't move through them. So the path to the key might be blocked by walls. Let me map out the path. If I move right multiple times, I hit walls at 2 steps right. So maybe I need to go around. The key is 3 steps down, so perhaps moving down first. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step down, then another at 2 steps down, etc. So maybe going straight down isn't safe.

Wait, the key is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe 0,0), moving right 5 steps would hit a wall at 2 steps right. So that's blocked. Maybe I need to move down first. Let me check the walls around. If I move down once, there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So that's blocked. How about moving left? The rules mention ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 4 steps down"", but I'm not sure where that is in relation to me.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. The key is win, so if I can turn myself into the win object, maybe touching the door would work. But how? The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. To change the win condition, I need to rearrange or remove the ""key is win"" rule. The text blocks for ""key is win"" are at 5 right, 2 up (rule 'is'), 6 right, 2 up (rule 'win'). To delete that rule, I need to move those text blocks away. But since wall is stop, I can't move objects that are stop. Wait, the rules specify that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as stop or similar. So if a text block is part of a rule that makes it stop, can I move it?

Looking at the objects, the 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up. That rule is ""wall is stop"", which probably makes wall objects immovable. So the text blocks for wall, is, stop are part of the wall's stop property. Therefore, I can't move those text blocks. But the key, is, win text blocks might not be stop. Let me check: the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. The text blocks for key, is, win are in the right area. Since they're not under the stop rule, maybe I can move them.

So the plan is: move to the key's position, but the path is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the 'key is win' rule to change the win condition. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then touching the door (which is a win) would make me win. But how to do that? I need to move the 'key' text block, 'is' text block, and 'win' text block away from their current positions to delete the rule. Then, create a new rule 'baba is win' by moving the relevant text blocks.

Let me see the positions. The 'key' rule is at 5 right, 2 up. The 'is' is at 6 right, 2 up. The 'win' is at 7 right, 2 up. To delete this rule, I need to move all three text blocks. But moving them might require navigating past walls. My current position isn't clear, but the key is at 5 right, 3 down. If I can get to the area where the 'key is win' text blocks are, I can move them. However, the path there is blocked by walls. For example, moving right from my position (assuming I'm at 0,0) would hit walls at 2 steps right. So maybe I need to go around by moving down first.

Looking at the walls: at 2 steps right and 2 up is a wall. At 2 steps right and 1 up is another wall. So moving right directly isn't possible. Maybe move down to avoid the walls. If I move down once, then right, but there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 down. Hmm. Alternatively, move left. There are rules to the left at 4 step left and 3 steps down for 'baba is you'. Maybe moving left to reach those text blocks.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push or move objects that are not stop. The walls are stop, so I can't push them. But the text blocks for other rules might be movable. For example, the 'key', 'is', 'win' text blocks. If I can move them away, I can delete the 'key is win' rule. Then create 'baba is win' by placing 'baba', 'is', 'win' together.

So the steps would be:

1. Navigate to the 'key is win' text blocks at 5,2 up; 6,2 up; 7,2 up.
2. Move each of these text blocks to another position to delete the rule.
3. Gather the 'baba', 'is', 'win' text blocks to create the new rule.
4. Then, go to the door (which is now the win object) to win.

But how to move the text blocks? Let's see their positions. The 'key' text is at 5 right, 2 up. To move it, I need to step on it and then move in a direction. But I might be blocked by walls. For example, to get to the 'key' text at 5 right, 2 up, I need to move right 5 times, but there's a wall at 2 steps right. So that's not possible. Alternatively, move down first. If I'm at position (0,0), moving down to (0,1), then right to (2,1), but there's a wall at 2 right and 1 up. So that's blocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial position is different. Maybe the player starts at a different spot. Let's assume the player is at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 4 step left and 3 steps down. But that's a text block, not the player's position. The player's position isn't specified in the observations, which is a problem. Without knowing where I am, it's hard to plan.

Alternatively, the player is near the 'baba is you' rule. For example, if the 'baba' text block is at 4 left, 3 down, then maybe the player is adjacent to that. But this is unclear. Given the lack of player position, perhaps the best approach is to focus on manipulating the rules first.

Since the key is win, but the door is also present, maybe the intended solution is to grab the key, which becomes the win object. But how to reach the key? The key is at 5 right, 3 down. If I can move right past the walls. Let's map the path:

From current position (unknown), to get to 5 right, 3 down:

- If I move right, but walls at 2 right block that.
- So perhaps move down first, then right, then down again.

But the walls are at various positions. For example, at 2 right, 2 up is a wall. At 2 right, 1 up is a wall. At 2 right, 1 down is a wall. So moving right from 2 right would hit a wall. Maybe need to go around by moving left, but the left side has rules but no walls mentioned except the ones created by 'wall is stop'.

Alternatively, use the ability to move text blocks to remove obstacles. For example, if I can move a wall's text block, but since wall is stop, maybe I can't. But the 'key is win' text blocks are not stop, so I can move them.

Suppose I move the 'key is win' rule away. Then the win condition reverts to default, which might be door or something else. Alternatively, create a new rule 'baba is win'.

But to do that, I need to gather the necessary text blocks. Let's see where they are:

- 'baba' text block: 4 left, 4 down.
- 'is' text block: 3 left, 4 down.
- 'you' text block: 2 left, 4 down.

So these are all to the left of the map. To get there, I might need to move left, but the player's starting position is unknown. Alternatively, if the player is near the right side, moving left past the walls.

But again, without knowing the player's position, this is challenging. Maybe the intended action is to move left towards the 'baba' text blocks to create the new rule. For example, moving left from the current position to reach 4 left, 4 down, then placing 'baba', 'is', 'win' together.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the solution is simply to move to the key's location. But the path is blocked. So perhaps the solution is to remove the wall blocking the path by moving its text block. The wall's text block is at 3 left, 1 up (rule 'wall'), but that's part of the 'wall is stop' rule, which makes it immovable.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to move towards the key, but find a path around the walls. For example, if I can move down, then right around the walls. Let's assume the player is at the starting position near the bottom left. Moving down to avoid walls, then right, then down again.

But without knowing the exact starting position, it's hard to say. Another possibility is that the player is already at the 'baba' text block, and needs to move the 'you' text block to attach to 'baba' and 'is' to make 'baba is you', but that's already active.

Alternatively, since 'key is win' is active, maybe the solution is to touch the key, which is at 5 right, 3 down. To get there, move right 5 steps, but walls block. So perhaps move down first to 0,1, then right to 2,1 (but wall there), so can't. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 5 right, 3 down. The player's position is unclear, but maybe they are at 0,0. To reach 5 right, 3 down:

Path: right, right, right, right, right, down, down, down.

But walls at 2 right, 2 up; 2 right, 1 up; 2 right, 1 down; etc. So moving right past 2 steps would hit a wall. So that's blocked.

Alternative path: move down first to avoid the upper walls. From 0,0 to 0,3 (down three times), then right to 5,3. But along the way, are there walls? At 2 right, 3 down there's a wall. So moving right from 0,3 to 5,3 would hit a wall at 2 right, 3 down. So that's blocked.

Another path: move left, then down, then right. For example, from 0,0 to -1,0 (left), but there's a rule at 4 left, 3 down, not a wall. So maybe left is possible. Move left to 3 left, 0 (assuming can move left past the 'baba' rule area), then down to 3 left, 3, then right to 5 left, 3. But this is speculative.

This is really challenging without knowing the exact player position. Given the previous failed actions, maybe the correct move is to try moving left to reach the text blocks needed to change the rule. For example, moving left towards the 'baba' text block at 4 left, 4 down. If I can get there, I can create 'baba is win' by moving 'win' text block nearby.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe the solution is to move to the key, but since it's blocked, the only way is to remove the wall blocking the path. But walls are stop, so can't be moved. Hence, the only option is to change the rules.

Therefore, the best action is to move left towards the 'baba' text blocks to rearrange the rules. So the chosen action is left.

24,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are still ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to reach the key because it's defined as win, but the door is probably the actual exit. But first, I need to get past the walls.

Looking at the objects on the map, the player (Baba) is at the position where the wall is 3 steps to the right. Wait, no, the player's position isn't explicitly listed. But since ""baba is you"", I must be wherever the Baba object is. Let me check the objects again.

There's a rule `baba` at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down. So, maybe the Baba is at that position. Let me visualize the map. The walls are creating a path that's probably shifted to the right each time. The key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down, and the door is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down.

The key is win, so grabbing it would make it a win condition. But the door is likely the exit. The problem is moving through the walls. The walls are marked as stop, so I can't move into them. Let me see the movement options.

From the current position (assuming I'm at the rule `baba` location: 2 left, 4 down), I can check possible directions. To the left would be towards the other rules (is and you), but I need to see if I can move there without hitting a wall. The walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. If I move left from the baba's position, that might be possible. Alternatively, down towards the key and door.

Wait, the key is at 6 right, 3 down. So from the baba's position (2 left, 4 down), moving right would increase the right steps. Let's calculate:

Baba's position: relative to where? The map's coordinates are a bit confusing. The observations mention positions relative to the player, perhaps. For example, ""wall 3 steps to the right"" means three steps to the right from the player's current position. So if I'm at the baba rule's position (2 left, 4 down), moving right would decrease the left steps and increase the right steps.

But maybe it's better to think of the grid as the player's perspective. Let me try to sketch it out:

Current active rules are still key is win, wall is stop, baba is you.

The objects are arranged such that there are walls forming a sort of corridor. The key is below the walls, and the door is further down. The rules for baba, is, and you are to the left of the main path. So perhaps the player needs to move left to reach those rules and possibly rewrite them.

Wait, the key is win, so if I pick up the key, does that make me win? Because the rule says key is win. So if I touch the key, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", then according to the rule ""key is win"", touching the key would make me the win object. Therefore, maybe the goal is to reach the key.

But the door is also there. Maybe the door is the actual exit, but the key being win might override that. Alternatively, the door could be the win condition if the rule isn't changed.

But the current active rules are key is win, so touching the key should make me win. However, in some levels, you need to reach the door which is win. But here, key is win. So perhaps the solution is to move to the key.

Looking at the map, the key is at 6 steps to the right and 3 steps down from the player's current position (assuming the player is at the baba rule's location: 2 left, 4 down). Wait, the player's position isn't directly listed, but the baba rule is at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. So if I'm at that position, moving right would be towards the main path.

But the walls are at 3 steps to the right in various positions. So moving right from the baba's position (which is 2 left, 4 down) would mean moving towards the right direction, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 up, 1 up, same level, etc. So maybe the path is blocked.

Alternatively, moving down towards the key. Let's see: from the baba's position (2 left, 4 down), moving down would take me further down. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. So relative to the current position, that would require moving right 8 steps (since baba is 2 left, so to get to 6 right, need 8 steps total right) and down 3 steps. But the walls are at 3 steps right in various positions. This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the key is to the right and down from the current position. Let's break down the coordinates:

- The baba rule is at 2 steps to the left and 4 steps down from the player's position. So the player is at (0,0), and the baba rule is at (-2, -4).

Other objects:

- wall 3 steps to the right and 2 step up: (3,2)
- rule `key` at (5,2)
- etc.

So the player's position is (0,0), and the key is at (5,2). But there's a wall at (3,2), which is between the player and the key. So to reach the key, the player would need to move right past the wall. But the wall is a stop, so the player can't move into it.

Therefore, the player needs to move around the wall. Since the wall is at (3,2), which is three steps right and two up, the player is at (0,0). To go around the wall, maybe move up first, then right, then down? Let's see:

1. Move up to (0,1)
2. Move right to (1,1)
3. Move right to (2,1)
4. Move right to (3,1) â€“ but is there a wall here? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at (3,2), but not at (3,1). So maybe possible.
5. Then move right to (4,1), (5,1), then up to (5,2) to get the key.

But the active rules are key is win, so touching the key would make the player win. However, the door is at (6,4), which is further right and down. Maybe after getting the key, the door becomes accessible, or perhaps the key allows bypassing the door's requirement.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move to the left to the area with the baba, is, and you rules. If the player can move there, they can potentially modify the rules. For example, creating a rule like ""baba is win"" or ""door is you"".

But to get to that area, the player would need to move left from their current position. From (0,0) to the baba rule at (-2, -4). Let's see:

1. Move left to (-1,0)
2. Move left to (-2,0)
3. Down to (-2,-1)
4. Down to (-2,-2)
5. Down to (-2,-3)
6. Down to (-2,-4) â€“ which is the baba rule's position.

At that point, the player is next to the baba, is, and you rules. Then, they can pick up the 'baba' rule and combine it with 'is' and 'you' to create a new rule, like ""baba is you"" (which is already active) or something else.

For example, moving the 'baba' rule (at -2,-4) to combine with 'is' (at -1,-4) and 'you' (at 0,-4). By doing so, the player could create a new rule such as ""baba is win"" or ""door is you"".

Creating ""baba is win"" would mean that touching any baba (the player) would make them win. Alternatively, making ""door is you"" would allow the player to move into the door.

So the steps could be:

1. Move left to reach the area with the baba, is, you rules.
2. Pick up the baba rule and move it to combine with is and you to create a new rule.

This would change the active rules, allowing the player to proceed.

But how to navigate there without hitting walls. Let's map the path:

From (0,0) to (-2,-4):

- Path: left, left, down, down, down, down.

But along the way, are there walls blocking?

Looking at the objects:

- There's a wall at (3,2), which is not in the way.
- Walls at (2 right, 1 up), (2 right, same level), etc. â€“ also not in the path to the left and down.

So the path to the left and down should be clear. Once the player reaches the baba, is, you rules, they can manipulate them to create a new rule.

For example, moving the 'baba' rule (at -2,-4) to the 'is' rule (at -1,-4), then to 'you' (at 0,-4) to form ""baba is you"" â€“ but that's already a rule. Alternatively, moving 'baba' to 'is' and 'you' to create ""baba is you"" again, which doesn't help.

Wait, maybe the existing rules are ""baba is you"", ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"". To create a new rule, the player needs to combine three text blocks: subject, 'is', object.

For instance, if the player moves 'baba' to 'is' and 'win' to form ""baba is win"", that would make the player win upon touching.

So the steps would be:

1. Reach the area with the baba, is, you, win, key rules.
2. Move the 'baba' text block to the 'is' and 'win' text blocks to create ""baba is win"".

But where are the 'win' and 'key' rules located?

The 'win' rule is at (7,2), which is far to the right. The 'key' rule is at (5,2). So accessing them would require moving right, but there's a wall at (3,2) blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe the player can create a rule that negates 'stop' or makes walls passable.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe the player can just move to the key despite the walls. But the wall at (3,2) is in the way. To go around it, the player might need to move up or down.

For example:

From (0,0):

1. Move up to (0,1)
2. Move right to (1,1)
3. Move right to (2,1)
4. Move right to (3,1) â€“ no wall here
5. Move right to (4,1), (5,1)
6. Move up to (5,2) â€“ key is here.

But the problem is that between (0,0) and (5,2), there's a wall at (3,2), but not directly in the path. However, moving from (5,1) up to (5,2) would reach the key. But does the player have to pass through (3,2) which is a stop? No, because the player is moving around it.

Wait, the wall at (3,2) is two steps up and three steps right from the player's initial position. The player's path to the key is going around the wall to the left or right. Since the wall is at (3,2), the player could go around it by moving up first, then right, then down.

So the path would be possible without hitting a wall. Then, picking up the key would make the player win because of the ""key is win"" rule.

But why hasn't the player done this earlier? Maybe previous actions didn't lead here. The assistant's previous actions were 'right', 'up', 'right', etc., but they were failing because the path was blocked or invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to pick up the key and then move to the door. But the door is at (7,4), which is further right and down. After getting the key, which is at (5,2), the player would need to move down to (5,3), (5,4), but there's a wall at (5,4) down? Let's check the objects:

There's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down, which is (3,4). The player is at (5,2) after getting the key. To reach the door at (6,4):

1. Move right to (6,2)
2. Move down to (6,3)
3. Move down to (6,4) â€“ which is the door.

But between (5,2) and (6,2), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right (which is (3, y)), so (6,2) is clear. Then moving down to (6,3) and (6,4) should be possible, as the door is there.

But the door's status depends on the active rules. If the rule is still ""key is win"", touching the door might not be sufficient. However, if the key is already obtained (making the player win), then reaching the door might be redundant. Or maybe the door becomes accessible if the player has the key.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to create a rule that makes the door passable or makes the player able to move through it.

But considering the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct path is to move to the key and then to the door. However, the assistant's previous actions were moving right and up, which might not be the optimal path.

Another angle: since the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", they can push objects if they are defined as pushable. But the active rules don't mention push, so maybe not. Unless the player creates a rule like ""baba is push"", but that requires manipulating the text blocks.

So, to summarize possible steps:

1. Move to the area with the baba, is, you rules to create a new rule.
2. Create a rule like ""baba is win"" to win by touching.
3. Alternatively, create ""door is you"" to enter the door.

But to do that, the player needs to reach the text blocks and rearrange them.

The coordinates of the relevant text blocks are:

- baba: (-2,-4)
- is: (-1,-4)
- you: (0,-4)
- key: (5,2)
- win: (7,2)

The player is at (0,0). To reach the baba, is, you area, need to move left and down.

Possible path:

1. Move left to (-1,0)
2. Move left to (-2,0)
3. Move down to (-2,-1)
4. Move down to (-2,-2)
5. Move down to (-2,-3)
6. Move down to (-2,-4) â€“ reaches the baba rule.

Now, at (-2,-4), the player is next to the baba, is, you rules. They can pick up the 'baba' rule and move it to combine with 'is' and 'you' to form a new rule.

For example:

- Move right to (-1,-4) (the 'is' rule)
- Then right to (0,-4) (the 'you' rule)
- This would create the rule ""baba is you"", which is already present. Not helpful.

Alternatively, to create ""baba is win"", the player needs the 'win' rule. But 'win' is at (7,2), which is far to the right. The player would need to move right past the wall at (3,2).

So, from (-2,-4), move right to get to the main path.

Path:

1. From (-2,-4), move right to (-1,-4)
2. Right to (0,-4)
3. Up to (0,-3)
4. Up to (0,-2)
5. Up to (0,-1)
6. Up to (0,0)
7. Now at original position, but need to move right towards the win rule.

But there's a wall at (3,2), which is two up and three right. So moving right from (0,0) to (3,0), then up to (3,1), etc., avoiding the wall at (3,2).

Alternatively, move up to (0,1), right to (1,1), right to (2,1), right to (3,1), then right to (4,1), (5,1), up to (5,2) â€“ key.

But this requires navigating around the wall at (3,2).

Once the key is picked up, the player is win, so they can potentially move freely or to the door.

Alternatively, after getting the key, move to the door at (6,4):

From (5,2):

1. Right to (6,2)
2. Down to (6,3)
3. Down to (6,4) â€“ door.

Since the player is now win (because key is win), touching the door might not be necessary, but it's possible that the level expects reaching the door.

However, in some Baba Is You levels, having the key makes you win, so maybe touching the key is sufficient. But the observation shows the door as a separate object, so perhaps the intended solution is to reach the door after obtaining the key.

But considering the previous attempts and the assistant's failed actions, maybe the correct action now is to move left towards the text blocks to create a new rule.

Alternatively, the player can move down towards the key area.

Another possibility: the current active rules are key is win, so touching the key should make the player win. Maybe the player just needs to reach the key, which is at (5,2). The path involves moving right, up, right, etc., but avoiding the wall at (3,2).

From (0,0):

1. Move up to (0,1)
2. Move right to (1,1)
3. Move right to (2,1)
4. Move right to (3,1) â€“ no wall
5. Move right to (4,1)
6. Move right to (5,1)
7. Move up to (5,2) â€“ key is here.

This path avoids the wall at (3,2) because it's moving around it to the left.

Once the key is reached, the player wins because of the ""key","

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the door, but in this case, the active rules say ""key is win,"" which probably means I need to get the key to win instead. The player is Baba, as ""baba is you"" is a rule. But the walls are ""wall is stop,"" so I can't move through them.

Looking at the map, I need to navigate from my current position to the key and then to the door. But the path is blocked by walls. The key is located at 6 steps right and 3 steps down from my position. Let me check the movement. Wait, maybe I can push or move text blocks to change the rules. 

The key is tagged as ""win,"" so getting it would mean winning. But to get there, I have to go through some walls. Since walls are ""stop,"" I can't go through them. Maybe I can rearrange the rules. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is you,"" then I could turn into a wall and walk through. Or maybe create a new rule like ""baba is push"" to move walls. 

Let me see the available text blocks. There are rules for ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" and ""stop."" The ""baba"" rule is at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. If I can move the ""baba is you"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can make myself a different property. 

Looking at the objects, the key is 3 steps down and 3 steps to the right. To reach it, I need to move down three times and right three times. But each step might hit a wall. Let me check the map again. There are walls at 1 step right, 2 steps right, etc., both up and down. The door is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. So after getting the key, I have to go further down to the door.

Wait, the key is win, so if I reach the key, I win. So maybe the key is the win condition. But the door is also there. The active rule says ""key is win,"" so perhaps grabbing the key makes me win. So the priority is to get to the key.

But the path to the key is blocked by walls. Let's see: from my current position (assumed to be at 0,0), moving right three times would hit walls at 1, 2, 3 steps right. Similarly, moving down would hit walls. So I need to find a way to remove the stop property from the walls or find a way around.

The text blocks are arranged such that ""wall is stop"" is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change what wall does. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I could move walls aside. Or if I make ""stop is wall,"" that might not help. Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is push"" to push walls.

But to move text blocks, they can't be stopped. So first, I need to ensure that I can move. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move unless there's a ""stop"" property. The walls are ""stop,"" so moving into them is blocked unless I change the rule.

Looking at the available rules, there's a ""baba"" rule at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. If I can move that ""baba is you"" rule to somewhere else, maybe I can create a new rule. For example, if I move it next to ""is"" and ""you,"" I could create a new rule like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is win.""

But how do I move the text blocks? I need to be adjacent to them and move them in a direction. Let's check the positions:

- The ""baba"" rule is 2 steps left and 4 steps down from my current position.
- The ""is"" rule is 1 step left and 4 steps down.
- The ""you"" rule is 4 steps down (assuming that's 1 step left and 4 steps down? Wait, the observation says ""rule `you` 4 steps down."" Wait, the exact positions need to be parsed.

Wait, in the observation, the objects are listed with their positions relative to the player. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up"" means that wall is one step right and three up from the player's current position.

The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 3 steps left and 3 steps down. The ""you"" rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps down. So these three are in a line to the left and down from the player.

The key is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. The door is at 5 steps right and 3 steps down.

So the player's position is at the starting point. To get to the key, need to go right 4 steps and down 2 steps. But there are walls blocking the way. The walls are at 1 step right, 2 steps right, etc., both up and down.

Wait, the active rules say ""wall is stop,"" so moving into a wall stops me. So I can't go through walls. Therefore, I need to find a way to remove the stop property from walls or find a path around by rearranging rules.

One possible solution is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule to something else. The ""wall"" rule is located at 4 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""wall is stop"" rule, perhaps I can replace it with another rule. For example, if I make ""wall is push,"" then I could push walls out of the way.

To move the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. Let's see where that rule is. It's at 4 steps left and 1 step up from the player. So the player is at, say, (0,0), and the ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-4, 1).

To move that rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it. Moving left four steps to get there, but there are walls at 1, 2, 3 steps right (which are the same as -1, -2, -3 in negative coordinates). So moving left from (0,0) would hit a wall at (-1,0), making it impossible to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Alternative approach: Use other text blocks to create new rules. For example, the ""baba is you"" rule is at (-4, -3). If I can move that to near the ""wall is stop"" rule, I could create a new rule like ""baba is stop"" or something else. But again, moving there might be blocked by walls.

Wait, perhaps I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules to create a new rule. The ""key is win"" rule is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move ""key,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" together, maybe I can create a new rule. But that seems complicated.

Another idea: Since ""key is win,"" maybe touching the key is sufficient to win. So perhaps the goal is to reach the key, which is behind several walls. To get past the walls, I need to change their properties. If I can make walls passable by altering the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule? It's located at (-4, 1), which is four steps left and one up. From the player's position, moving left four steps is blocked by walls at (-1, 0), (-2, 0), etc. So that's not possible.

Alternative plan: Use the existing rules to push walls. If I can create a ""baba is push"" rule, then I could push walls out of the way. To create that, I need to have the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""push"" text blocks in the correct positions.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""baba"" rule at (-4, -3), an ""is"" at (-3, -3), and a ""you"" at (-2, -3). If I can move these to form ""baba is push,"" I need to have ""baba"" next to ""is,"" then ""push."" But where is the ""push"" text block? It doesn't seem to be present in the initial setup. Wait, the active rules are ""key is win,"" ""wall is stop,"" and ""baba is you."" So the available text blocks are for key, is, win, wall, is, stop, baba, is, you. There's no ""push"" block. So I can't create a ""push"" rule unless I can find or create a ""push"" text block, which I don't think is present here.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I don't need to path through the walls but instead find a way to make the walls not stop me. For example, if I can change ""stop"" to something else. The ""stop"" rule is at (-2, 1). If I can move that rule, maybe I can replace it with a different property.

But again, moving to (-2, 1) requires moving up and left, which might be blocked. Alternatively, use the ""baba is you"" rule to move other blocks. Wait, since I'm Baba and can move, maybe I can push the text blocks if they are not stopped. But ""wall is stop,"" so maybe other text blocks can be moved.

Wait, the text blocks like ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""wall,"" ""stop,"" ""baba,"" ""you"" â€” these are all movable unless they are part of a stop rule. Since the only stop rule is ""wall is stop,"" other text blocks can be moved. So I can move the ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" ""baba,"" ""is,"" ""you,"" etc., as long as they are not blocked by walls.

So perhaps the strategy is to move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position so that grabbing the key doesn't make me win. Wait, but the active rule is ""key is win,"" so even if I move that rule, the current active rule would still be ""key is win"" until I rearrange it. Maybe I need to delete the ""key is win"" rule or replace it with something else.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes Baba be able to pass through walls. For example, ""baba is not stop"" or ""wall is not stop."" But to create that, I need the appropriate text blocks.

Looking at the available text blocks, there's a ""stop"" rule at (-2, 1). If I can move that ""stop"" rule and replace it with something else. For example, if I make ""stop is key,"" then walls would be stop but keys would be stop as well, which might not help.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""baba is stop"" to turn myself into a stop, but that would prevent me from moving. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I can use the ""baba is you"" rule to create a new rule that gives me the ability to move through walls. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" or ""baba is key."" But how?

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" maybe I can push the walls. If I can create a ""baba is push"" rule, then I can push walls out of the way. Let's see: To create ""baba is push,"" I need the ""baba"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and a ""push"" text block. But there's no ""push"" text block in the current setup. The available text blocks are key, is, win, wall, is, stop, baba, is, you. So no ""push"" is present. Therefore, I can't create a ""push"" rule.

Another idea: The key is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. If I can move horizontally to the right, maybe I can reach the key's x-coordinate. But the path is blocked by walls at 1, 2, 3 steps right. So moving right directly isn't possible.

Wait, but maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule to be next to the key, so when I touch the key, it applies the rule. But I'm already next to the key? No, the key is at 6 steps right and 2 steps up. The player is at the starting position, so moving right 6 steps and up 2 would reach the key. But there are walls in between.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to manipulate the rules to bypass the walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is you,"" then walls would be controllable like Baba. But to do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule to ""wall is you."" To do that, I'd need to move the ""wall"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""you"" text block together.

The ""wall"" text block is at 4 steps left and 1 step up. The ""is"" text block is at 3 steps left and 1 step up. The ""you"" text block is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. So these three are in a line: ""wall is you"" at (-4,1), (-3,1), (-2,1). If I can move these to create ""wall is you"" somewhere else, like near the walls, then walls would be you, and I could walk through them.

But to move them, I need to be adjacent to each text block and move them. Starting from the player's position (0,0), moving left 4 steps to reach the ""wall"" text block at (-4,1) is blocked by walls at (-1,0), (-2,0), etc. So that's not possible.

Alternative plan: Use the ""baba is you"" rule to move other blocks. Since I'm Baba, maybe I can push blocks that are not stopped. But the walls are stopped, so other blocks like ""key,"" ""is,"" ""win,"" etc., can be moved.

For example, the ""key is win"" rule is at (6,2). If I can move that rule closer, maybe I can reach the key by moving horizontally first. But moving right 6 steps is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can move the ""key"" text block to a different position. The ""key"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I can separate them, maybe the key becomes a standalone object. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, create a new rule that makes the key a pushable object. For example, ""key is push."" But again, I don't have a ""push"" text block.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to think step by step.

Current active rules:
- key is win: touching the key wins.
- wall is stop: can't pass through walls.
- baba is you: I am controllable.

Objects on the map:
- Key at (6,2) (right 6, up 2)
- Door at (7,4) (right 7, down 4)
- Walls forming a barrier to the right and down.

Possible actions:
1. Try to move right towards the key, but blocked by walls.
2. Try to move up, but there's a wall at 2 steps up.
3. Rearrange rules to change wall's property or create a way to pass.

Since moving through walls is impossible, the focus is on rule manipulation.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at (-4,1). To change this, I need to move the ""wall,"" ""is,"" and ""stop"" blocks. But accessing that area is blocked.

Alternative idea: Use the ""baba is you"" rule to move other blocks. For example, move the ""is"" and ""win"" blocks to create a new rule that affects walls.

The ""baba"" rule is at (-4,-3), ""is"" at (-3,-3), ""you"" at (-2,-3). If I can move these to create a rule like ""wall is you,"" that would make walls controllable.

To do that, I need to move the ""wall"" text block (which is part of the existing ""wall is stop"" rule at (-4,1)) and combine it with ""is"" and ""you"" from the baba rules.

But moving the ""wall"" block from (-4,1) to somewhere else requires moving left four steps, which is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe there's another way. If I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks from the baba rules to the ""wall"" block's location.

For example, move the ""is"" at (-3,-3) up to (-3,1), then move the ""you"" at (-2,-3) up to (-2,1), and then move the ""wall"" block at (-4,1) to (-4,0). Then combine them into ""wall is you.""

But this requires navigating around the walls. From the player's position (0,0), moving left to reach (-4,1) is impossible due to walls. Alternatively, move the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks to the right, but they are already at the edge.

This seems too difficult. Maybe another approach: Since the key is win, perhaps I can make Baba into the key by creating a rule like ""baba is key."" Then, since I'm Baba and the key is win, touching anything (including myself) would win.

To create ""baba is key,"" I need the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""key"" text blocks. The ""baba"" rule is at (-4,-3), ""is"" at (-3,-3), and ""key"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule at (6,2). So I need to move the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""key"" blocks close together.

But moving the ""key"" block from (6,2) to near the baba rules would require moving left 6 steps and down 2 steps, which is blocked by walls.

Alternative idea: Use the existing ""key is win"" rule. If I can move the ""key"" part of the rule to be under Baba, then maybe the rule applies to me. For example, if I move the ""key"" text block to be adjacent to Baba, then the rule ""baba is key"" would be created, making me the key and thus winning.

The ""key"" text block is part of the ""key is win"" rule at (6,2). To separate it, I need to move the ""key"" block away from ""is"" and ""win."" But that would break the ""key is win"" rule, making the key not","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: idle

Observation:
Active rules:

wall is stop

rule `you` 4 steps down

door 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down",0,False
26,left,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". The goal is usually to reach the ""win"" object, which in this case is the key. But since ""key is win"", picking up the key would make it the win condition. How do you pick up the key? I think you have to move onto the same tile as the key. But the problem is the path is blocked by walls, which are stop. Since ""baba is you"", I can move through non-stop objects. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them.

Looking at the map, I need to navigate from the player's position (which I assume is at the starting point, possibly at the bottom left?) to the key. Let's check the objects again. The key is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, there's a wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down. So moving directly down from the key's position is blocked. 

Wait, the player (Baba) is probably at the position where ""baba is you"" rule is, which might be somewhere on the map. Let me see the objects. There's a rule `baba` at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down. So the Baba object is there. Let's assume the player is at that position. So Baba is at 2 left, 4 down. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. The door is at 7 right, 4 down. 

To move from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down) to the key (6 right, 3 down), I need to figure out the path. Let's break down the coordinates. Moving right from 2 left to 6 right would require moving 8 steps to the right. But there are walls every step to the right starting from 1 step right. So maybe there's a way to go around. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. If I go down from Baba's position (4 down) to 3 down, that's possible. But the problem is the walls. Let's look at the walls: 

- wall 1 step to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 3 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So from 6 right, 3 down (the key's position), moving left to avoid the walls. But how? Maybe move down to 3 down, then left past the walls. Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules. 

Wait, the rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", ""baba is you"". If I can change a rule, maybe I can make walls not stop. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So if I can move that rule, perhaps I can remove the stop property from walls. 

But how do I move the rules? I need to be adjacent to the text blocks and move them. Let's see where the ""baba is you"" rule is. The rule `baba` is at 2 step left and 4 steps down. The rule `is` is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. The rule `you` is at 4 steps down. So those are part of the ""baba is you"" rule. 

To create a new rule, I might need to move these text blocks. For example, if I can take the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks and combine them with another subject. But the goal is to change the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So maybe move the ""stop"" text block to somewhere else. 

But to move any text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. Since ""baba is you"", I can move. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up from the current map's wall. Let's check the positions again. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up. So if I can move down to that position, pick up the ""stop"" text block, and then place it somewhere else to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. 

So the plan would be: 

1. Move from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down) to the ""stop"" rule at 1 step up. Wait, the ""stop"" rule's position is 1 step up. But how does that coordinate work? Let me clarify. The observation shows the ""stop"" rule at 1 step up. So from the current position, moving up once would reach the ""stop"" rule. Then, take the ""stop"" block and move it somewhere else, like combining it with another ""is"" to form a new rule. 

But the problem is that moving up from Baba's position (2 left, 4 down) to 1 step up might be possible if there's no wall. Let's see the walls: 

- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- etc. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step up, which might be in a different part of the map. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""stop"" rule is near the other rules. The rules ""key is win"" are at 5,6,7 steps right and 2 step up. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 step left and 1 step up. Wait, the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of ""wall"" at 3 left, 1 up; ""is"" at 2 left, 1 up; ""stop"" at 1 left, 1 up. So the ""stop"" rule is part of that. 

To break the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to either remove the ""stop"" property from walls or change the subject. If I can move the ""stop"" text block away, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be destroyed. 

So the steps could be: 

- Move to the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 1 up.
- Pick it up and move it to another position, perhaps combining it with another ""is"" to form a new rule that removes stop from walls. 

But how to get there? The player is at 2 left, 4 down. To reach 1 left, 1 up, need to move left and up. Let's see if the path is blocked. 

From 2 left, 4 down: moving left to 1 left, then up to 1 up. But are there walls in between? The walls are at various positions, but the exact path needs to be checked. 

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes ""stop"" something else. For example, ""stop is key"" or similar. But to do that, need to have the necessary text blocks. 

Another approach: Since the key is the win condition, maybe just move to the key's position and take it, even if it's blocked by walls. But since walls are stop, and the player is you, you can't pass through them. So that's not possible unless the walls are moved. 

Wait, maybe by rearranging the rules, the walls can be made passable. For example, if I change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then I could push the walls out of the way. But to do that, I need to modify the existing rule. 

To modify a rule, you can take the ""is"" from the ""wall is stop"" rule and replace it with another property. For example, take the ""is"" block and replace it with ""push"", then form ""wall is push"". 

So the plan would be: 

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule components.
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move to a different position and create ""wall is push"".
4. Then, the walls are pushable, and you can move around them. 

But how to execute this? Let's see the positions. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule consists of: 
- rule `wall` at 3 step left and 1 step up
- rule `is` at 2 step left and 1 step up
- rule `stop` at 1 step left and 1 step up

So the ""is"" is at 2 left, 1 up. The player is at 2 left, 4 down. To reach the ""is"" block, need to move up from 4 down to 1 up, which is 3 steps up. But along the way, are there walls? 

Looking at the walls: 
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up
- etc. But the vertical path might be clear. 

From 2 left, 4 down: move up three times to reach 2 left, 1 up (the ""is"" block). Along the way, check for walls. 

At each step up:
- From 2 left, 4 down â†’ 2 left, 3 down: no wall mentioned there.
- 2 left, 2 down: wall 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down? Wait, the walls are at 1 step right and 2 up, 2 steps right and 2 up, etc. So maybe the vertical path is clear. 

Assuming no walls in between, moving up to the ""is"" block at 2 left, 1 up. Then take the ""is"" block and move it to a new position. For example, move it next to the ""wall"" block and the ""push"" property (if available). Wait, but where is the ""push"" property? It's not listed in the active rules. So maybe create a new rule using existing blocks. 

Alternatively, take the ""is"" block and combine it with the ""baba"" block and ""you"" to form a new rule. But that might not help. 

Alternatively, take the ""is"" block from ""wall is stop"" and replace it with ""push"" to make ""wall is push"". But the ""push"" property is not present on the map. Unless there's a rule I'm missing. 

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", ""baba is you"". There's no ""push"" rule. So to create ""wall is push"", I need a ""push"" text block. But it's not present. Unless I can combine existing blocks. 

Alternatively, maybe use the ""you"" block to make oneself push. But that's unclear. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: Since the key is the win, and it's located at 6 right, 3 down, perhaps the intended solution is to push the walls away by changing their rule to ""wall is push"". 

To do that, I need to modify the ""wall is stop"" rule. Let's try to execute that. 

1. Move to the ""is"" block of the ""wall is stop"" rule (position 2 left, 1 up).
2. Pick up the ""is"" block.
3. Move to the ""wall"" block (position 3 left, 1 up).
4. Place the ""is"" block next to the ""wall"" block, and then add a ""push"" block. But there's no ""push"" block. Unless I can create one by rearranging other rules. 

Alternatively, take the ""stop"" block and move it away, making the ""wall is"" rule incomplete, thus destroying it. 

If I remove the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the rule would be ""wall is"", which is invalid, so it would disappear. Then, walls wouldn't have the stop property. 

So steps: 
1. Move to the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 1 up.
2. Pick it up and move it somewhere else, like next to another ""is"" to form a new rule. 

But where to move it? If I move the ""stop"" block to create a new rule, like ""key is stop"", that might not help. But if I can move it away from the ""wall is stop"" rule, the original rule would be destroyed. 

So, moving the ""stop"" block to a different position. For example, placing it next to the ""key is win"" rule. 

The ""key is win"" rule is at 5,6,7 right and 2 up. If I move the ""stop"" block there, forming ""key is stop win"" or something, but that might not make sense. 

Alternatively, just move the ""stop"" block far away so the original rule is broken. 

The player is at 2 left, 4 down. To reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 1 up: move left once, then up three times. 

Assuming no walls in that path, the player can move there. Then, take the ""stop"" block and move it, say, to the left of the ""baba"" rule. 

Once the ""stop"" block is removed from the ""wall is stop"" rule, walls no longer are stop, so they can be passed. Then, the player can navigate around the walls to the key. 

But how to confirm this? Let's outline the steps: 

1. Move left from 2 left to 1 left.
2. Move up three times from 4 down to 1 up, reaching the ""stop"" block.
3. Pick up the ""stop"" block and move it to a new position, say, next to the ""key"" rule.
4. Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken, so walls are passable.
5. Navigate from Baba's original position to the key, avoiding the now-passable walls. 

But the key is at 6 right, 3 down. The player is at 2 left, 4 down after moving. Wait, no: after moving left to 1 left and up to 1 up, the player is at 1 left, 1 up. Then moving the ""stop"" block elsewhere, say to 0 left, 0 up. Then, the player can move down to the original position and then right towards the key. 

Alternatively, after moving the ""stop"" block, the player can go down to 1 left, 4 down, which is the original position, then move right past the walls. 

But this requires precise movement. 

Another consideration: Once the ""stop"" block is moved, the player can pass through walls, so they can walk straight to the key. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. From the player's new position (after moving the ""stop"" block), they need to move right and down. 

But this is getting a bit complex. Let's try to outline the exact actions needed. 

First, the player is at 2 left, 4 down. 

Action 1: Move left to 1 left, 4 down. 
Action 2: Move up to 1 left, 3 down. 
Action 3: Move up to 1 left, 2 down. 
Action 4: Move up to 1 left, 1 down. 
Action 5: Move up to 1 left, 1 up. (Now at the ""stop"" block)
Action 6: Take the ""stop"" block. 
Action 7: Move left to 0 left, 1 up. 
Action 8: Place the ""stop"" block somewhere, say next to the ""key"" rule. 
Now, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. 

Then, the player can move down to 0 left, 4 down, then right towards the key. 

But the exact path may require navigating around other objects. 

Alternatively, once the walls are no longer stop, the player can go around them. The key is at 6 right, 3 down. From the player's position after moving the ""stop"" block (say, at 0 left, 1 up), moving down to 0 left, 4 down, then right to 6 right, 4 down, then down to 6 right, 3 down (the key's position). 

But there's a wall at 6 right, 3 steps down (key's position's down?), wait the key is at 6 right, 3 steps down. So from 6 right, 3 down, moving down is blocked by a wall. Wait, the key is at 6 right, 3 down. So to reach it, the player needs to move to that tile. But since the key is the win condition (""key is win""), just standing on it should win the level. 

So the steps would be: 

After removing the ""stop"" property from walls, move right past the walls to the key's position. 

But how to do that? Let's think about the path. 

From the player's position after moving the ""stop"" block (say, at 0 left, 1 up), move down to 0 left, 4 down. Then move right to 1 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 steps right and 4 steps down. So the player needs to go around. 

Alternatively, move right from 0 left, 4 down to 6 right, 4 down, avoiding the walls. 

But the walls are at 3 steps right and various downs. 

This is getting quite intricate. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make walls passable, then go straight to the key. 

Given the time I've spent, I think the best action now is to move towards the ""stop"" block to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. So the next action should be to move left to reach the ""stop"" block. 

Looking at the current observation, the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 2 step left and 4 steps down. To get to the ""stop"" block at 1 step left and 1 step up, the player needs to move left once and up three times. 

So the first valid action would be to move left. Then continue moving up. But since the system is expecting a single action per step, the immediate action is to move left from the current position.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". That means the key becomes the win object, walls are stop (can't pass through), and since I'm Baba, I can move around but can't go through walls.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down from my current position. The door is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. To get to the door, I need to reach the key first because ""key is win"", so grabbing the key would make it the win condition. But moving there might be blocked by walls.

Let me check the path. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe near the initial ""baba"" text block), moving right multiple times seems necessary. But there are walls at 1 step right, 1 step right and 1 up, etc. Wait, the walls are positioned such that they form a barrier. For example, at 4 steps right and 2 steps up there's a wall, and similar walls below. So moving straight right might hit those walls.

Wait, the key is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Maybe I need to navigate around the walls. Let's see: if I go right, but there's a wall at 4 steps right, maybe I have to find another path. Alternatively, since I'm Baba (and thus ""you""), maybe I can rearrange the rules to pass through walls. But the current rules are ""wall is stop"", so unless I change that, I can't go through walls.

The key is ""win"", so getting it would let me win, but the door is the actual exit. Wait, noâ€”the door is probably a ""win"" object, but the active rule says ""key is win"". Hmm, maybe once I pick up the key, it becomes the win object, so standing on it would win? Or do I need to take it to the door?

Looking back at the observation, the door is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. The key is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So the path from the key to the door is one step right and one step down. But between them, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down. Wait, the wall is at 4 steps right and 4 steps down, and the door is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe after getting the key, I can move right past the walls?

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the rules. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""stop is"", then I could move through walls. But to do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. Let's check where the rule pieces are.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule stop"" at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. The ""rule wall"" is at 1 step left and 1 step up. The ""rule is"" is at 1 step up. So if I can move the ""stop"" text block, I could remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how?

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a ""stop"" property. The ""stop"" rule is currently making those walls immovable. The text blocks for the rules are:

- rule `key` at 7 steps right, 2 up
- rule `is` at 8 right, 2 up
- rule `win` at 9 right, 2 up
- rule `wall` at 1 left, 1 up
- rule `is` at 1 left, 1 up
- rule `stop` at 1 right, 1 up

So the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. To move that, I need to be next to it and not blocked. But the path to it might be blocked. Let's see: from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe where the ""baba"" rule is), moving left to reach the ""stop"" rule's position might be possible if there's no wall in the way.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 up, but that's further right. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. So from my starting position (let's assume I'm at the initial Baba position, which is probably at 4 left and 4 down based on the first observation, but the exact starting point might vary), moving left towards the ""stop"" rule might be possible if there's a clear path.

Wait, in the current observation, the walls are positioned as follows:

- wall at 1 step right and 2 up
- wall at 1 right, 1 up
- wall at 1 right (base)
- walls going down from 1 right.

So the path to the ""stop"" rule at 1 right, 1 up might be blocked by the wall at 1 right. Wait, the wall at 1 right is at the base (same level as the starting position?), and the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. So if I'm at the starting position (maybe at 0,0), moving right to 1 right, then up to 1 up would hit the wall at 1 right, 1 up. But the wall is a ""stop"", so I can't move through it.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the better approach is to first reach the key. To get to the key at 7 right, 3 down, I need to move right multiple times, but there are walls blocking the path. Let's see the path:

From starting position (assuming):

1. Move right to 1 step right (but there's a wall there, so can't).
2. Maybe need to go around. However, the walls are structured such that moving right directly is blocked. Alternatively, maybe the key is positioned such that after moving right several times, there's a way down.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the rules to make walls passable. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then I could move around them. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block and the ""wall"" text block.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. If I can move both of these, I could create a new rule like ""wall is"", effectively removing the ""stop"" property.

But to move them, I need to be adjacent and not blocked. Let's see:

- The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. To move it, I need to be next to it. Suppose I'm at 1 right, same level. But there's a wall at 1 right (base), which is a ""stop"", so I can't move into it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to win first. Since ""key is win"", picking up the key would make me win immediately. But how do I reach the key?

The key is at 7 right, 3 down. To get there, I might need to move right past several walls. Let's see the path:

From starting position (let's assume starting at 0,0):

- Move right 4 times to reach 4 right. But there's a wall at 4 right, 2 up, which is a ""stop"". So can't go through that. Maybe need to go around.

Alternatively, move down first. But the base has a wall at 1 right, so moving down from there would be blocked.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules to make walls passable. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule to create a new rule like ""stop is push"" or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is"", then walls wouldn't block me. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. If I can move that text block, say, to the position where ""wall"" is defined, then I could create a new rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. If I move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and combine them with ""is"", I could make ""wall is [something else]"". For example, if I move ""stop"" to be next to ""wall"" and ""is"", then I could create ""wall is"" by combining them.

Let's see the positions:

- rule `wall` is at 1 left, 1 up
- rule `is` is at 1 left, 1 up (another ""is""?)
- rule `stop` is at 1 right, 1 up

To create a new rule, I need to have the subject, ""is"", and the property adjacent. So if I can move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" and ""is"" rules, I can create a new rule. For example, moving ""stop"" to the left of ""wall is"", making ""wall is stop"" into ""wall is [empty]"" or something.

But this requires precise movement. Suppose I'm at the ""stop"" rule's position (1 right, 1 up). To move it left, I need to be adjacent. But there's a wall at 1 right (base), which is a ""stop"", so I can't move left from there. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" rule. There's a ""rule is"" at 1 left, 1 up and another at 1 right, 1 up. If I can move one of the ""is"" rules next to the ""stop"" rule, then combining them could change the rule.

This seems complicated. Maybe the priority is to reach the key. Since ""key is win"", picking it up would make me win. So how to get to the key?

The key is at 7 right, 3 down. From the current observation, my position might be moving right each time the action was ""left"", leading to the wall positions shifting. Wait, in the previous actions, the user kept moving left, leading to the walls shifting right each time. So perhaps the player is moving left, causing the entire map to shift right? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Looking at the observations: after each ""left"" action, the positions of the walls and rules shift. For example, the first observation had walls at 1 step right, then after moving left, the walls shifted to 2 steps right, then 3, etc. So it seems that moving left makes the entire map shift to the right, effectively moving the player right through the level.

Ah, so the player is moving left, but the map is static, so it appears as if the player is moving right. That's a common mechanic in Baba Is You where moving in one direction can shift the entire level. So by moving left, the player is progressing through the level to the right.

In that case, the previous actions of ""left"" have been moving the player right through the level, and the walls are shifting accordingly. Now, in the latest observation, the walls are at 4 steps right, and the key is at 7 right, 3 down. So the player is at 4 right, needs to move right to 5, 6, 7 to get to the key.

But between 4 right and 7 right, there are walls at 4 right (base), 4 right and 1 up, etc. So moving right from 4 to 5 would hit a wall at 4 right (base), which is a ""stop"". Therefore, cannot move right directly.

This suggests that the player needs to find a way around the walls, possibly by rearranging the rules. Since the key is the win object, grabbing it would make the game end, but the door is at 8 right, 4 down. Alternatively, maybe after picking up the key, the win condition is satisfied by being next to the key.

But to reach the key, the player must navigate around the walls. Given that moving right is blocked, perhaps the solution is to push the walls aside by changing their properties. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", allowing the player to move through them by pushing.

To do that, the player needs to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. If the player can move that text block, they can create a new rule like ""wall is push"".

But how to reach the ""stop"" rule's position? The player is currently at 4 right, and the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. Since moving left from 4 right would take them further right (due to the map shifting), maybe the player needs to move up or down first.

Alternatively, since the player is Baba (""baba is you""), maybe they can turn themselves into a non-stop object. For example, creating a rule like ""baba is stop"" would make them unable to move, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"" would make them the win object, but that requires moving the ""win"" rule.

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up. To move that, the player would need to be adjacent to it. Given the current positions, it's far to the right.

This seems really complex. Maybe the intended solution is to move left until the ""stop"" rule is in a position that can be moved. Alternatively, since each ""left"" action shifts the map right, perhaps after several left moves, the ""stop"" rule will be in a reachable position.

But in the latest observation, after moving left multiple times, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up, which is still to the left of the player's current position (4 right). So the player is at 4 right, and the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. To move the ""stop"" rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it. They could move up to 1 right, 1 up, but there's a wall there (a ""stop"" wall), which they can't pass through.

Wait, the wall at 1 right, 1 up is a ""stop"", so the player can't move into that space. Therefore, they can't reach the ""stop"" rule's position to move it.

This is a dead end. Maybe the solution is to instead create a rule that allows the player to move over walls. For example, creating ""push is stop"" or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the key is the win object, maybe the player can just grab it and win, even if they can't reach the door. In some Baba levels, reaching the key with ""key is win"" is sufficient to win the level. So if the player can reach the key, they can win by standing on it.

So the plan is: navigate to the key at 7 right, 3 down. To get there, move right past the walls. But how?

The path from 4 right to 7 right is blocked by walls at 4 right (base), 4 right and 1 up, etc. Maybe the player can use the ""is"" rules to create new rules. For example, moving the ""key"" rule to create a new rule that allows movement.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the key, making ""key is win"" a permanent rule even if the key is moved.

But this requires precise movement. Let's think step by step.

Current position: Assuming after moving left multiple times, the player is at 4 right, same level as the ""baba"" rule at 4 left, 4 down (from earlier observations). Wait, maybe the player's position is dynamic based on the actions taken.

This is getting too confusing without a visual map. But based on the observations, after moving left several times, the walls and rules shift to the right. The latest observation shows the player is near 4 right, and the key is at 7 right, 3 down.

The only way to proceed is to keep moving right, but the walls are in the way. Unless there's a way to rearrange the rules to bypass them.

Another idea: Since ""baba is you"", maybe the player can turn into the key by creating a rule ""baba is key"", making them the key, which is win. But to do that, the player needs to move the ""key"" rule next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 2 up. The player is at 4 right. To reach it, they need to move right, but there's a wall at 4 right. So this seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to move the ""is"" rule that's at 6 right, 2 up (from the latest observation: rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up). If the player can move that ""is"" rule next to the ""key"" rule and ""baba"" rule, they could create a new rule like ""baba is key"".

But again, the player is at 4 right and needs to move right past walls to reach the ""is"" rule at 7 right, 2 up. This seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""win"" rule to be next to the key, making sure that grabbing the key wins. But the ""win"" rule is at 9 right, 2 up, which is even further right.

This is really challenging. Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, perhaps the intended action is to keep moving left to shift the map and eventually reach the ""stop"" rule in a reachable position. Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push the walls by changing their property to ""push"".

Wait, in the latest observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 1 up. If the player can move that to be part of a new rule like ""wall is push"", then they can move through walls. To do that, they need to move the ""stop"" rule next to the ""wall"" rule and an ""is"" rule.

The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up, and there's an ""is"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. So if the player can move the ""stop"" rule from 1 right, 1 up to be next to the ""wall"" and ""is"" at 1 left, 1 up, they can create ""wall is push"".

But how to move the ""stop"" rule from 1 right to 1 left? The player would","

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. That means if I get the key, it becomes the win condition, so I need to get it. Since baba is you, I can move around like Baba. The walls are stop, so they block me.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down. There's a door at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. But the door might be behind a wall or something. Right now, the walls are arranged such that moving right might lead me into a stop wall. Let me check the map again.

The current position of Baba isn't specified, but based on the rules and objects, maybe I'm near the left side. The key is towards the right, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 4 steps right, there are walls going down. The key is 7 steps right, 3 down. So to get there, I need to move right past the walls. But the wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down is blocking the path down. The door is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down, which is past that wall. 

Wait, the active rules say key is win, so if I take the key, then the key itself becomes the win object. So maybe I just need to reach the key. But how? The path to the key might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the layout.

From the current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe leftmost), moving right towards the key. But there are walls at 1 step right and up, then more walls as I go down. The key is three steps down from the key's row. Maybe I need to move around the walls. Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the rules to remove the stop property from the walls.

But the current rules are wall is stop. If I can change that, maybe by moving the text blocks. The rule ""wall is stop"" is located at 1 step left and 1 step up. To change that, I need to move either the ""wall"" rule, the ""is"" rule, or the ""stop"" rule. But the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step right and 1 step up, which is a different position. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `baba`, `is`, and `you` at the bottom left. Maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is stop"" to become immovable, which would block myself. That's not helpful. Alternatively, ""baba is win"" so that I turn into the win condition. But how?

Alternatively, since key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key. Let's check the path. If I move right from my current position (assuming I'm at the leftmost), towards the key. But there are walls at 4 steps right and various positions. Let's see:

- To get to the key at 7 right, 3 down, I need to move right past the walls. The walls at 4 steps right are blocking the lower path. Maybe I need to go around them by moving up first. But the walls at 4 steps right and 2 step up might be part of the structure. 

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So any wall is stop. The key is win, so grabbing it would make it the win object. So the goal is to get to the key. 

Looking at the key's position: 7 steps right and 3 steps down. Let's see the obstacles. From the current position (maybe starting at 0,0), to get to 7 right, 3 down, I need to move right 7 times and down 3. But along the way, there are walls. For example, at 4 steps right, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down. That's below the key. But the key is at 3 steps down, so maybe that wall isn't in the way. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me list them:

Walls:
- 2 steps right and 2 up
- 3 steps right and 2 up
- 4 steps right and 2 up
- Then walls at 4 steps right and 1 up, 4 right, 4 right and 1 down, 2 down, 3 down, 4 down.

So the path to the key at 7 right, 3 down would require moving right past the walls at 4 right. But how? The key is further right than the existing walls. Maybe there's a path through the upper part. Let's see:

From my current position (assumed to be left of the key), moving right towards the key. The walls at 4 right might be a cluster. The key is at 7 right, 3 down. So maybe I need to move right past 4, then continue. But the walls at 4 right and 4 down block moving down further. However, the key is at 3 down, which is above that. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move up first to avoid the lower walls. For example, move up to bypass some walls, then right. But the walls at 4 right and 2 up might be blocking that. 

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can just move to it directly if possible. Let's see the path. Suppose I'm at position (0,0). To reach (7,3):

Right 7 steps, down 3. But along the way, there are walls at (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2) maybe? Not sure. But according to the objects listed, the walls at 4 steps right and 2 up, then rule key at 7 right and 2 up. So between 4 and 7 right on the 2 up row, there are rules but no walls except at 4 right. So maybe I can move right past 4, then continue. 

But the walls at 4 right and 1 down, 2 down, etc., are down from 4 right. So if I move right from 4 to 5,6,7, that's possible unless there are walls in between. The key is at 7 right, 3 down. So moving right from 4 to 7, then down 3. But are there walls in between?

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- wall 2 steps to the right and 1 step up (wait, no: the first observation had wall 2 steps right and 2 up, but in later observations, it's moving. The current observation says:

Current walls:

- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `key` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `is` 8 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `win` 9 steps to the right and 2 step up
- rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` 1 step up
- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step up
- wall 4 steps to the right
- wall 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- key 7 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down
- rule `is` 4 steps down
- rule `you` 1 step to the right and 4 steps down
- wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- door 8 steps to the right and 4 steps down

So the walls at 4 right are stacked vertically from 1 step up to 4 steps down. So at 4 right, positions up to 4 down are walls. The key is at 7 right, 3 down, which is outside that wall cluster. So moving right from 4 to 7 should be possible if there are no walls in between. 

Assuming I'm at the position near the left side, perhaps at 1 step left and 4 steps down (where the baba rule is), or another position. But without knowing my exact position, it's a bit hard. But the key is to reach the key. 

So the plan is: move right towards the key, avoiding the walls. Since the walls at 4 right are only up to 4 down, and the key is at 3 down, which is within that range, but the key is at 7 right. So after passing 4 right, I need to keep moving right to 5,6,7. Then down to 3. 

But are there walls between 4 and 7 right? According to the objects listed, the only walls beyond 4 right are at 4 right itself and the door at 8 right. So between 4 and 7 right, there are no walls mentioned. So moving right from 4 to 7 should be possible. 

Once I reach the key at 7 right, 3 down, since key is win, touching it would win the level. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move right from current position to 4 right (if not already there).
2. Continue moving right to 5,6,7.
3. Move down to 3 steps.

But how to navigate around the walls at 4 right's lower positions. Since those walls are at 4 right and 1,2,3,4 down, but the key is at 3 down. So moving down from 4 right to 3 down is possible because there's a wall at 4 right and 4 down, but the key is at 3 down. So after reaching 7 right, moving down 3 steps should be possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the path is blocked by other walls. But according to the current objects, there are no walls between 4 and 7 right except at 4 right itself. 

Another thing to consider: the door at 8 right and 4 down. The door might require a key, but since key is win, maybe having the key allows opening the door. But the key is already the win condition, so maybe touching the key is enough. 

So the action plan is to move right towards the key. The previous attempts had the assistant moving left, but that's probably incorrect. The correct action is to move right towards the key's location. 

Therefore, the chosen action is to move right.

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. My goal is usually to reach the win object, but right now the key is set as win. So I need to get the key to become the win condition, or maybe change the rule so that something else is win.

Looking at the map, I'm positioned as Baba, right? Because ""baba is you"" means I can move around. The walls are stopping me, so I have to navigate around them. The key is down to the right at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. The door is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. But the door is probably behind a wall or something since the path from the key to the door is blocked by walls.

The rules are scattered. There's a rule ""key is win"" up on the right side. To change that, I need to move the 'win' text block next to something else, like maybe 'baba' or 'key'. But right now, the 'win' is attached to 'key', making key the win object. If I can swap those, then maybe the door becomes the win.

But first, how do I get to the 'win' rule? It's at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. There's a wall at 4 steps right, so I need to navigate around. Let's see the current position of Baba. The rules for 'baba' are at 2 steps left and 4 steps down. So Baba is probably at that position? Or maybe I need to check where Baba is located on the map. Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 4 steps down"". So the actual Baba entity might be elsewhere? Maybe the player starts at a default position, but the observation doesn't specify where I am. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Assuming I need to reach the 'win' rule to change it. The path to the 'win' rule is blocked by walls. Let me visualize the grid. If I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule (2 steps left and 4 steps down), moving right would take me towards the walls. Alternatively, maybe I should go towards the key first. The key is at 6 steps right and 3 steps down. From the 'baba' rule position, moving right three steps and down three steps would get me there. But along the way, there are walls at 3 steps right and various downs. So maybe I need to find a path around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the existing rules to manipulate things. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move the text blocks. The 'win' rule is currently attached to 'key'. If I can move the 'win' text block next to 'baba', then the rule would become 'baba is win', making the door (which is likely a 'win' object) the target. But how to do that?

To move a text block, I need to be adjacent to it and not blocked by a 'stop' property. The 'win' rule is at 8 steps right and 2 steps up. To get there, I need to navigate through the maze. Let's see: starting from the 'baba' rule position (2 left, 4 down), moving right towards the center. But there are walls at 3 steps right in various directions. Maybe I need to go up first. From 2 left, 4 down, moving up one step to 2 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 3 steps right and 3 steps down. So if I'm at 2 left, 3 down, that's adjacent to the wall at 3 right, 3 down. So I can't move right past that wall. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe move down. From 2 left, 4 down, moving down to 2 left, 5 down. But are there walls there? The objects list walls at 4 steps right and 4 steps down, which is probably further to the right. Not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: since the key is win, pressing the key would make it win, but the key is down there. If I can get to the key, then maybe collect it and then go to the door. But the door is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down, which is behind a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe after getting the key, I need to move that wall rule?

The 'wall' rule is at 2 steps left and 1 step up. If I can move that 'wall' rule away, then the path to the door might be clear. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the 'wall' rule and move it. Let's see where the 'wall' rule is: 2 left, 1 up. If I can move from my current position (assuming I'm at the 'baba' rule location) to that 'wall' rule, maybe I can rearrange the rules.

Alternatively, focus on changing the 'win' rule. The 'win' is currently linked to 'key'. If I can move the 'is' rule next to 'baba' and 'win', that might create a new rule. For example, if I have 'baba is win', then I would be the win object. But how to get the 'is' block there.

The 'is' rules are at various positions: 5 right, 2 up; 3 left, 1 up; 1 left, 1 up; and 4 steps down. Maybe I can move the 'is' from 4 steps down to be between 'baba' and 'win'. But to do that, I need to navigate to that 'is' block.

This is getting quite involved. Let me recap the possible steps:

1. Reach the key (at 6 right, 3 down) to fulfill the current 'key is win' rule.
2. Then go to the door (7 right, 4 down), but the path is blocked by a wall at 4 right, 4 down. So need to remove that wall.
3. To remove the wall, either change the 'wall is stop' rule or move the wall rule. Since 'wall is stop' is a rule, if I can change that to 'stop is wall' or something else, but that might not help. Alternatively, move the 'wall' text block away so it's not applying to that position.

Alternatively, make Baba the win by creating 'baba is win' rule. To do that, need to move 'win' next to 'baba' using 'is'. The 'is' block is at 4 steps down. So from the current position, maybe move down to reach that 'is' block, then rearrange.

But the problem is navigation through the walls. Let's try to map out the maze.

Assuming Baba is at the position of the 'baba' rule: 3 step to the left and 4 steps down. Wait, no, the rule says ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 4 steps down"". So the actual Baba entity is probably at a different position. Maybe the starting position is implied. This is unclear without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is fixed, and the objects are relative. This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe the best approach is to focus on moving the 'win' rule to be associated with 'baba' instead of 'key'.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right from my current position. But there's a wall at 4 right, 2 up. So I can't go straight right. Maybe move up first, then around.

From the 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down), moving up one step to 3 left, 3 down. Then right towards the center. But there's a wall at 3 right, 3 down. So can't go right. Move up again to 3 left, 2 down. Still blocked by the wall at 4 right, 2 up is maybe not in the same row. Wait, the wall at 4 right and 2 up is separate. Maybe the path is clearer if I go around the walls.

This is really tricky without a visual. Maybe the key point is to realize that since the key is win, pressing the key makes it win. So if I can reach the key, then I've completed the level. But the key is at 6 right, 3 down. How to get there?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 right, 3 down (the key's position is 6 right, 3 down). So the key is two steps to the right from the wall. But I can't move through walls. So need to find a path around.

From the 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down), moving right towards the center. Let's see:

- Move right once to 2 left, 4 down.
- Then right again to 1 left, 4 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 4 down. So can't go further right.
- Move down to 1 left, 5 down. Then right to 0 left, 5 down. Then right to 1 right, 5 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at various positions, but not sure. This is getting too vague.

Alternatively, focus on moving the text blocks. Since I'm Baba and can move text that's not stop. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 2 up. To get there, I need to move right and up, but avoiding walls. Maybe move up from the 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down) to 3 left, 3 down. Then right to 2 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 left, 3 down. Then right to 0 left, 3 down. Then right to 1 right, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 3 right, 3 down is two steps right, so maybe not in the way. Continue right to 2 right, 3 down. Wall at 3 right, 3 down is next. So can't go further right. Then move up to 2 right, 2 down. Then right to 3 right, 2 down. But there's a wall at 3 right, 2 down. So stuck again.

This is frustrating. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules instead of navigating through walls. For example, move the 'win' rule next to 'baba' using the 'is' rule. The 'is' rule is at 4 steps down. So from the 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down), move down to 3 left, 5 down. Then find the 'is' rule at 4 steps down. Wait, the 'is' rule at 4 steps down is probably at the same horizontal position. If the 'is' is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down, then moving from 3 left, 4 down to 1 left, 4 down (adjacent), then take the 'is' block and move it next to 'baba' and 'win'.

So steps could be:

1. Move from 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down) to the 'is' rule at 1 left, 4 down.
2. Pick up the 'is' block and move it to between 'baba' and 'win'.
3. This creates 'baba is win', making Baba the win object.
4. Then just stand on Baba (which is you) to complete the level.

But how to move the 'is' block. Let's see:

Current position: assuming I'm at the 'baba' entity's location, which is probably at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 3 step to the left and 4 steps down. So to get to the 'is' rule at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down, I need to move left once. From 3 left to 1 left, same y (4 down). So action: left.

Once there, pick up the 'is' block and move it. For example, move right to place it next to 'baba' (which is at 3 left, 4 down) and 'win' (8 right, 2 up). Wait, that's too far. Alternatively, place it between the existing 'baba is you' rule and the 'win' rule.

The existing 'baba is you' rule is at 2 step left and 4 steps down (the 'baba' rule), then 'is' at 1 left, 4 down, then 'you' at 4 steps down. So to create 'baba is win', I need to move the 'win' rule's 'win' block next to 'baba' with 'is' in between.

The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 2 up. That's quite far. Maybe instead, take the 'win' block from there and move it to near 'baba'.

But to move the 'win' block, I need to navigate to its position (8 right, 2 up), which is blocked by walls. Alternatively, move the 'win' block via existing paths.

This is getting too complex. Maybe the simplest solution is to go get the key and then go to the door. Since the key is win, picking it up would make it win. But how to reach the key.

The key is at 6 right, 3 down. From the 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down), moving right three steps and down three steps. But the path is blocked by walls at 3 right, various downs. So perhaps move around the walls.

Alternative path:

From 3 left, 4 down:

1. Move down to 3 left, 5 down.
2. Move right to 2 left, 5 down.
3. Move right to 1 left, 5 down.
4. Move right to 0 left, 5 down.
5. Move right to 1 right, 5 down.
6. Move up to 1 right, 4 down.
7. Move up to 1 right, 3 down. Here's the key at 6 right, 3 down. Wait, no, the key is at 6 right, 3 down. So from 1 right, 3 down, need to move right five steps. But there's a wall at 3 right, 3 down. So can't go straight right. Maybe move up to 1 right, 2 down, then right to 2 right, 2 down, then right to 3 right, 2 down (which is a wall), stuck again.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules. Since the key is win, but we need to reach the door, perhaps change the win rule to door. But the door isn't a rule yet. Alternatively, make door win by creating a rule.

But the door is an object, not a text block. Unless there's a 'door is win' rule that can be created. But to do that, I need to have the text blocks 'door', 'is', 'win' adjacent.

The door is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 8 right, 2 up. The 'door' object isn't a text block, so I can't directly create a rule about it unless I have the text blocks for 'door', 'is', 'win'.

Wait, the objects listed include the door, but there's no rule for it except the existing 'key is win', 'wall is stop', 'baba is you'. So to make door win, I need to create a rule 'door is win'. But to do that, I need to have the 'door' object and the text blocks 'is' and 'win' placed adjacent.

The 'door' is at 7 right, 4 down. The 'win' text block is at 8 right, 2 up. The 'is' text block is at 7 steps to the right and 2 step up (part of the 'key is win' rule), and also at 4 steps down (the 'is' in 'baba is you').

Maybe I can move the 'win' block down to near the door. For example, move the 'win' block from 8 right, 2 up to 7 right, 4 down, placing it next to the door. But to do that, need to navigate through the maze with the 'win' block.

This requires carrying the 'win' block while moving around walls. Let's see:

Start at 'baba' rule position (3 left, 4 down). Move to the 'win' rule at 8 right, 2 up. But the path is blocked. Alternatively, move the 'is' block first to create a path.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct action here is to move left towards the 'is' block at 1 left, 4 down to start rearranging the rules.

Let's see. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So, the goal is to get the key because key is win. But the key is a win object, meaning grabbing it would make me the win condition. Normally, you have to reach the win object, but here since key is win, maybe touching the key makes me win. Or maybe the door is still the win, but the rules say key is win. Not sure yet.

I am Baba, so since ""baba is you,"" I can move around. The walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The key is down at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. There's a door at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. But how to get there?

Looking at the map, there are walls to the right blocking the path. The key is below, but there's a wall at 4 steps right and 3 steps down. Wait, the key is at 7 steps right and 3 steps down. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, which is probably near the left side?), I need to move right. But the walls are moving right each time I move left. Wait, in the observations, every time the agent moves left, the wall positions shift. For example, after moving left, the wall at 2 steps right and 2 up moves to 3 steps, then 4, etc. So maybe the level is shifting, and the solution involves moving in a way that the walls don't block the path.

Wait, but how do the walls move? It seems like when the agent moves left, the walls shift to the right. Like, after the first left move, the wall positions increase by one step to the right. So the pattern is that moving left causes the walls to shift right, creating a path. Maybe the strategy is to move left until the walls shift enough to create a corridor, then move right through.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. Since ""key is win,"" maybe I can pick up the key by moving to it. But how do I get past the walls? The walls are stop, so I can't push them unless they're not stop. But the rule says wall is stop, so they can't be moved. Unless I can change the rule. For example, if I can create a rule that says ""wall is not stop,"" then I could move through walls. But how?

The key is at 7 right, 3 down. To get there, I need to move right multiple times. But each time I move right, there's a wall blocking. Wait, in the current observation, the wall is at 4 steps right. So maybe I need to move left first to shift the walls, then move right when the path is clear.

Looking at previous steps, when the agent moved left, the wall positions increased by one each time. So after moving left multiple times, the walls would shift further right, making a path. For example, if I keep moving left, eventually the walls will be out of the way, allowing me to move right to the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can pick up the ""is"" or ""you"" text blocks to create new rules. For instance, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" or ""BABA IS KEY,"" then I could win by touching the door or something else. But I need to move those text blocks to form a new rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""baba"" rule at 1 step left and 4 steps down, followed by ""is"" and ""you."" So if I can move those blocks to say ""baba is win,"" that might change the win condition. But how to reach that spot? The walls are there, but maybe after shifting the walls by moving left, I can access that area.

So the possible steps are:

1. Keep moving left to shift the walls right, creating a path.
2. Once the path is clear, move right to the key area.
3. Pick up the key (since key is win) and possibly move to the door.

But in the current observation, after moving left, the walls have shifted right. For example, after moving left once, the wall at 2 steps right becomes 3, then 4, etc. So if I keep moving left, eventually the walls will be far enough right that I can move right through.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" by moving the text blocks. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down, with ""is"" and ""you"" next to it. If I can move those blocks to form ""baba is win,"" then touching any win object (like the door) would make me win. But moving those blocks requires avoiding the stop walls.

So the steps would be:

- Move down to reach the text blocks at 4 steps down.
- Navigate past the walls (which are stop) by moving left or right when possible.
- Pick up the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" blocks and rearrange them to form ""baba is win.""

But the problem is that the walls are stop, so I can't move through them. Unless I can change their property. But since wall is stop, and I can't push stop objects unless they're not stop. So unless I can create a rule that makes wall not stop, I can't move them.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to win. Since key is win, grabbing the key would make me the win object. So moving to the key's position and taking it would make me win. But how to get there? The key is at 7 right, 3 down. The path is blocked by walls at 4 right and 3 down. So I need to move right past those walls. But walls are stop. Unless I can move the walls by changing the rule.

Wait, if I can change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is nothing,"" then I could move through them. But how to do that? I need to find the ""wall is stop"" rule and break it apart or move it.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 step left and 1 step up, and another at 1 step right and 1 step up. To break this rule, I need to move the ""stop"" text block away. But since those are part of the rule, moving either ""wall,"" ""is,"" or ""stop"" would break the rule.

So possible actions:

- Move left to get closer to the text blocks that make up the rules.
- Once near, move the ""stop"" block to a different position, effectively changing the rule.

But the challenge is navigating to those text blocks without hitting the walls. The walls are shifting each time I move left, so maybe the strategy is to keep moving left until the text blocks become accessible.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move right towards the key, but the walls are in the way. Wait, in the current observation, the wall is at 4 steps right. So if I'm at position 0, moving right 4 steps gets me to the wall. But the key is at 7 steps right, 3 down. So I need to move right 4 steps to hit the wall, which is stop. So can't go through. Hence, need to find another way.

Another angle: since the key is win, maybe just grabbing the key is enough. So if I can reach the key, then I win. But how? The key is at 7 right, 3 down. Path is blocked by walls at 4 right. So need to move around.

Wait, looking at the map:

- The key is at 7 right, 3 down.
- There are walls at 4 right, 1 down; 4 right, 2 down; 4 right, 3 down; and 4 right, 4 down.
- The door is at 8 right, 4 down.

So the key is behind a wall at 4 right, 3 down. To get there, I need to move past that wall. But since walls are stop, I can't. Unless I can move the wall by changing the rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 4 left, 1 up and 1 right, 1 up. If I can remove the ""stop"" from that rule, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. So perhaps I need to grab the ""stop"" text block and move it elsewhere.

To do that, I need to navigate to the ""stop"" block. In the current observation, ""stop"" is at 1 step up. Looking at the objects:

- rule `stop` 1 step up: probably at (x, y) where y is 1 up. But the exact position depends on the initial setup. Maybe it's near the top.

Assuming I can get to the ""stop"" block by moving up and left, then move it away to break the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then walls would be passable.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make touching any win object (like the door) make me win. To do that, I need to gather the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""win"" text blocks.

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 4 steps down, followed by ""is"" and ""you."" The ""win"" rule is at 7 steps right and 2 steps up. So if I can move the ""win"" block down to the ""baba is"" location, I can form ""baba is win.""

But moving those blocks requires avoiding the walls. The path might involve moving left to reach the ""baba is you"" area, then moving the ""win"" block down there.

This seems complex, but possible. So possible steps:

1. Move left multiple times to shift the walls right, making the text blocks accessible.
2. Navigate to the ""baba is you"" rule area at 4 steps down.
3. Pick up the ""baba,"" ""is,"" and ""you"" blocks.
4. Move the ""win"" block from its current position (7 right, 2 up) down to the ""baba is"" area.
5. Form the new rule ""baba is win,"" then go to the door (which is a win object) to win.

Alternatively, grab the key since key is win, but need to path through walls. If walls are stop, can't. So changing the wall rule is necessary.

Another possibility: create a rule that makes ""key"" a pushable object, then push it towards me. But that requires rearranging the rules.

But given the time constraints, maybe the quickest way is to keep moving left to shift the walls right, eventually accessing the text blocks to change the rules.

In the current observation, after moving left a few times, the walls have shifted right. For example, the wall was at 2 steps right initially, then 3, then 4. So if I keep moving left, the walls will keep shifting right, eventually moving out of the way.

Once the walls are shifted enough, I can move right through to the key area. Alternatively, access the text blocks to change the rules.

But the problem is that the agent's previous actions resulted in failed attempts, possibly because the model didn't figure out the shifting pattern.

So, considering the latest observation, the walls are at 4 steps right. To move right past them, but they're stop. So the only way is to change the rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" block away, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. So the action would be to move towards the ""stop"" block.

But how to reach it? The ""stop"" block is part of the rule ""rule `stop` 1 step up."" So it's located at some coordinate. Assuming the agent is at the starting point, perhaps near the left side, moving up and left to reach the ""stop"" block.

Alternatively, move down to the area where the ""baba is you"" rule is, then move the ""you"" block to somewhere else, but that might not help.

Another angle: since key is win, maybe the solution is simply to move to the key's position. But the path is blocked. So perhaps the walls are moving, and by moving left, the path becomes clear.

For example, if I move left once, the walls shift right by one, creating a path. Then I can move right through the new gap.

In the current observation, the wall is at 4 steps right. If I move left, the walls would shift to 5 steps right, allowing me to move right past 4 to 5, then through.

But how to confirm this pattern? It seems that each time the agent moves left, the wall positions increase by one step to the right. So the solution is to move left repeatedly until the walls have shifted enough to create a corridor.

In the latest observation, the walls are at 4 steps right. If I move left, the walls become 5 steps right. Then I can move right from 0 to 5, avoiding the walls.

So the action should be to move left to shift the walls, then right to reach the key.

But the agent needs to execute this step by step. Since previous attempts resulted in failures, maybe the model needs to realize the shifting pattern and move left once, then right.

In the current observation, after moving left, the walls are at 4 steps right. If I move left again, they become 5, then 6, etc. So moving left once would shift them right, creating a path.

Therefore, the first action should be to move left to shift the walls, then right to proceed.

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current situation. The active rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. So right now, the goal is to get the key because key is win. But there's a wall that's stop, which means I can't move through it. Baba is you, so I can move around unless blocked by stop.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 8 steps right and 3 steps down from where I'm standing. There's a door at 9 steps right and 4 steps down. The walls are all to the right of me, forming a path that might be blocked. The rules for wall, stop, and the other key-related ones are spread out. 

The key is win, so I need to reach it. But the path to the key is blocked by walls that are stop. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you,"" I can move, but the walls are stop, meaning I can't go through them. But maybe I can manipulate the rules to change what's a stop or make myself able to pass through walls. 

Looking at the rules on the map, there's ""rule `key`"" at 8 right, 2 up. The ""is"" next to it, and ""win"" further right. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can change the win condition. Alternatively, if I can make the wall not a stop, that would help. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step up. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can replace ""stop"" with something else. But wait, the rules that define properties like stop are usually immutable unless you can move the text blocks. However, the tip says that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as STOP or similar immovable properties. The current rules have wall as stop, so can I move the ""wall is stop"" rule? Wait, the rule itself is ""wall is stop,"" so moving the text blocks that make up this rule. Since the subject is wall and the property is stop, maybe moving the ""stop"" part or changing it. 

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that changes Baba's property. For example, if I can make ""baba is not stop,"" then I could walk through walls. But to do that, I need to manipulate existing rules. The current rules are key is win, wall is stop, and baba is you. There's also a rule ""rule `baba`"" at 4 steps down, which might be part of a different rule, like ""baba is you"" being split into parts. 

Looking at the objects: there's a rule `baba` at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down, then rule `is` and rule `you`. So the ""baba is you"" rule is composed of those three text blocks. Similarly, ""wall is stop"" is made of rule `wall`, rule `is`, rule `stop`. 

If I can move these text blocks, perhaps I can break the existing rules and create new ones. For instance, if I take the ""stop"" from the ""wall is stop"" rule and attach it to something else, like making ""baba is stop,"" but that would be bad. Alternatively, create ""baba is win"" so that touching Baba makes you win. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is win, if I can reach the key, touching it would win. But the path is blocked. The walls are all to the right. Maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to somewhere else, disabling the stop property for walls. But how? The ""wall is stop"" rule is in pieces: rule `wall` at 1 step up, rule `is` next to it, and rule `stop` further. To redefine wall's property, I might need to replace ""stop"" with another property. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" text block and attach it to something else, like making ""key is stop,"" but that would block the key. Not helpful.

Wait, another approach: Since the current rule is ""key is win,"" maybe I can move that rule so that ""baba is win,"" making touching Baba the win condition. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" part from the key rule and attach it to Baba. Let's see. The key rule is at 8 right, 2 up (rule `key`), 9 right, 2 up (rule `is`), 10 right, 2 up (rule `win`). If I can move the ""win"" block from the key rule and attach it to Baba's rule. The Baba rule is at 1 left, 4 down (rule `baba`), 1 left, 4 down (rule `is`), and 2 right, 4 down (rule `you`). So if I take the ""win"" block and place it after ""baba is you,"" making ""baba is win,"" then touching Baba would make you win. But how to do that movement?

The problem is that the ""win"" block is currently part of the key rule. To move it, I need to separate the key rule. For example, move the ""win"" block from the key rule's position and attach it to the Baba rule. But I have to check if that's possible. Since the key rule is ""key is win,"" moving the ""win"" part would break that rule, making it ""key is"" (incomplete) and then create a new rule ""baba is win."" 

But can I move the ""win"" block? The ""win"" block is at 10 steps right and 2 steps up. To get to it, I might need to navigate through the walls. However, the walls are to the right, so maybe moving left or up. But my current position isn't clear, but looking at the objects, the door is at 9 right, 4 down. The key is at 8 right, 3 down. The ""win"" block is up higher. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to reach the ""win"" block by moving upwards. But the walls are at 5 steps right and 2 up, so perhaps there's a path. Wait, the map has walls at 2 steps right and 2 up, then moving right each time. So the structure is like a corridor that gets longer to the right. The key is in a lower part, down at 3 steps down. 

Another angle: Since the key is win, if I can reach the key, that's the goal. But the path is blocked by walls that are stop. So maybe I need to make the walls not stop. How? By changing the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" part of that rule to another object, like making ""key is stop,"" but that would block the key. Alternatively, make ""baba is stop,"" but that would stop me. Not helpful. 

Wait, what if I create a new rule that says ""you can go through stop""? But there's no such property. Alternatively, redefine stop. For example, if I can make ""stop is nothing,"" but the game might not allow that. 

Wait, the rules are formed by [Subject] IS [Property]. So if I can break the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving its parts, then wall would no longer be stop. For example, if I move the ""stop"" text block from the wall rule to somewhere else, then wall would just be a subject without the stop property. Then I could walk through walls. 

So the plan is: 

1. Move the ""stop"" block from the ""wall is stop"" rule to another location, thus disabling the wall's stop property. 

2. Then, navigate through the walls to reach the key. 

Alternatively, create a new rule that allows movement through walls. 

But how to do this step by step? Let's look at the objects again. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: 

- rule `wall` at 1 step up 

- rule `is` next to it at 1 step up 

- rule `stop` at 1 step to the right and 1 step up 

To break this rule, I need to move one of these blocks. If I move the ""stop"" block, then the rule becomes ""wall is"" (incomplete) and the ""stop"" is separate. Then, maybe I can use the ""stop"" block to create another rule, like ""baba is stop,"" but that would be bad. Alternatively, ""key is stop,"" but that blocks the key. 

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block to the key's rule. If the key's rule is ""key is win,"" adding ""stop"" to it would make ""key is win stop,"" which doesn't make sense. Probably not useful. 

Another idea: Since the key is win, maybe I can make Baba be win by rearranging the rules. For example, take the ""win"" block from the key rule and attach it to the Baba rule. The Baba rule is ""baba is you."" If I change it to ""baba is you win,"" does that make touching Baba win? Possibly. But I'm not sure how the game interprets multiple properties. 

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" block from the key rule (10 right, 2 up) to the Baba rule (1 left, 4 down). But how to get there? The path is blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to reach the ""win"" block by moving up. The walls are at 5 steps right and 2 up, but perhaps there's a space above. Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the current objects, the walls are structured as follows: 

- At 5 right, 2 up: wall 

- At 6 right, 2 up: rule `key` 

- 7 right, 2 up: rule `is` 

- 8 right, 2 up: rule `win` 

So the upper part has the key and win rules. To get to the ""win"" block at 10 right, 2 up, I need to move right past the walls. But the walls are stop, so I can't. Unless I can redefine stop. 

This seems like a dead end. Another approach: Since the key is win, maybe I can push the key to the door? But the key is at 8 right, 3 down, and the door is at 9 right, 4 down. There's a path there. But to push the key, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction while holding it. But can I hold objects? In Baba Is You, you can move objects that are not stop. Since the key isn't stop (unless defined otherwise), maybe I can move it. 

Wait, the key's rule is ""key is win,"" but that doesn't make it stop. So the key is movable. If I can reach the key, then I can move it towards the door. But the path to the key is blocked by walls. 

So the steps would be: 

1. Remove the stop property from walls so I can walk through them. 

To do this, break the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, move the ""stop"" block from the wall rule to somewhere else. 

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at: 

- rule `wall` at 1 step up 

- rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 1 step up 

- rule `stop` at 1 step up 

If I move the ""stop"" block, say, to the key's location, then wall would no longer be stop. 

But how to move the ""stop"" block? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step up. Looking at the map, my current position isn't explicitly stated, but the objects are positioned relative to the player. Assuming the player is somewhere in the grid, perhaps near the lower part where the key and door are. 

Alternatively, maybe the player is at the starting point, and the map is laid out with Baba (the player) somewhere. Since ""baba is you,"" the player is a Baba entity. 

Assuming the player is near the lower part, say at 5 steps right, 4 steps down (next to the wall and door), then to reach the ""stop"" block at 1 step up, they would need to move up, but there are walls blocking the path. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe another angle: Since the key is win, and it's located at 8 right, 3 down, perhaps I can move the ""win"" rule to the door. The door is at 9 right, 4 down. If I can make the door the win condition, then reaching the door would win. But how? 

The current ""win"" is attached to the key. If I can move the ""win"" block from the key rule to the door's location, then touching the door would win. But the door is an object, not a text block. The rules are formed by text blocks, so maybe I can create a ""door is win"" rule. 

To do that, I need to take the ""win"" block from the key rule and place it next to ""door"" and ""is"". The door is at 9 right, 4 down. So if I move the ""win"" block to 9 right, 4 down, and place ""is"" and ""door"" around it, forming ""door is win."" 

But how to physically move the blocks? The player would need to navigate to the ""win"" block, move it, then move to the door and assemble the new rule. 

The ""win"" block is at 10 right, 2 up. To get there, the player would have to move right from their current position, but the path is blocked by walls. Unless the player can move through walls by redefining them. 

This seems like a loop. Maybe the solution is to first remove the stop property from walls, then navigate to the key. 

To remove wall's stop property, break the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" block is at 1 step up. If the player can move that block, say, to a different location, then walls would no longer be stop. 

Assuming the player is at a position where they can reach the ""stop"" block, they could pick it up and move it. For example, if the player is to the left of the ""stop"" block, they could move right to grab it and then move it elsewhere. 

But based on the observations, after several left and right actions, the positions of the rules are shifting. For example, in previous observations, moving left or right caused the rules to move accordingly. So each time the player moves left, all the rules shift left by one step, and vice versa. 

Ah, this is a key insight! In Baba Is You, when you move left or right, all the text blocks and rules shift in the opposite direction. So if the player moves right, all the rules move left, and if the player moves left, the rules move right. This means that the player can leverage this movement to access different parts of the rule structure. 

So the strategy might involve: 

1. Moving left or right to reposition the ""wall is stop"" rule's components so that the ""stop"" block is in a position that can be moved. 

2. Once the ""stop"" block is isolated, move it away to disable the wall's stop property. 

3. Then, navigate through the now non-stop walls to reach the key. 

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block from the key rule to the Baba rule to make touching Baba win. 

Given that the player's previous actions were left and right, causing the rules to shift, the current observation shows that after several left moves, the ""wall is stop"" rule's components are now at 1 step up, 1 step to the right and 1 step up, etc. 

In the latest observation, the ""wall is stop"" rule is: 

- rule `wall` at 1 step up 

- rule `is` at 1 step to the left and 1 step up 

- rule `stop` at 1 step up 

The ""key is win"" rule is at increasingly higher right positions as the player moves left. 

So, if the player continues to move left, the ""wall is stop"" rule's components will move right, potentially placing the ""stop"" block in a position that can be easily moved. 

Alternatively, moving right might bring the ""win"" block into reach. 

But the key is at 8 right, 3 down, and the door is at 9 right, 4 down. If the player can reach the key, that's the goal. But the path is blocked by walls. 

Another possibility: Since the key is win, maybe pushing the key towards the door would work. If the player can move the key, they could place it next to the door, but the door is a separate object. 

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects that are not stop. If the key is not stop, then the player can push it. So if I can remove the stop property from walls, then walk around and push the key to the door. 

But the initial problem is accessing the key. 

Given the shifting rules, perhaps the correct approach is to keep moving left until the ""stop"" block from the wall rule is in a position that can be moved. For example, if the player moves left enough times, the ""stop"" block might end up adjacent to the key or another rule that can be manipulated. 

Alternatively, since the player can move rules by moving left or right, maybe rearranging the rules to form a new rule that benefits the player. 

For example, creating ""baba is win"" by moving the ""win"" block to the Baba rule. 

The current Baba rule is at 1 left, 4 down (rule `baba`), 1 left, 4 down (rule `is`), and 2 right, 4 down (rule `you`). If the player can move the ""win"" block from the key rule (which is at 10 right, 2 up) to the Baba rule's location, they could form ""baba is win you,"" making touching Baba win. 

To do this, the player would need to navigate to the ""win"" block, move it down to the Baba rule's area, and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is."" 

Given that moving left shifts all rules to the right, and moving right shifts them to the left, the player can use directional movement to position the ""win"" block where needed. 

In the latest observation, the ""win"" block is at 10 right, 2 up. The player's current position isn't specified, but assuming they are near the lower part, moving up might be possible if the path is clear. However, the walls are stop, so unless they're redefined. 

This is quite complex. But considering the","

32,up,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure this out. The active rules are ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But wait, in the objects list, the key is located at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. There are walls all around that area, which are stop, so I can't move through them. The door is at 9 steps right and 4 steps down, which might be the exit, but I need to get past the walls.

Since Baba is you, moving as Baba makes me able to push things? Wait, no, in Baba Is You, usually if you're you, you can move, but pushing might depend on other rules. But here, the walls are stop, so I can't go through them. The key is win, but to get to it, I might need to move the rules. The key is 3 steps down from the current position. But looking at the map, moving down directly is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the rules. The rules ""key is win"", ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"" are probably text blocks that can be moved. The key is at 8 right, 3 down. To reach it, I need to get past the walls. Maybe if I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, then the walls wouldn't block me. But to do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" text block. Where is that located? The rule ""wall is stop"" is at 1 step up. So if I can move that rule, maybe I can make walls not stop. Alternatively, create a new rule that says ""wall is you"" or something.

But how do I move the text blocks? I have to be next to them and move them in a direction, but the direction is probably relative to my position. Let me look at the objects again. The rule ""wall is stop"" is 1 step up. So if I'm positioned to move towards that rule, I can pick it up and move it. But where am I currently? The user's position isn't explicitly stated, but the rules and key are positioned in a certain way. Assuming I'm at Baba's position, which is at 4 steps down (from the rule ""baba is you"" at 4 steps down). So maybe I'm at the same location as the ""baba"" rule.

If I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule, perhaps I can change walls to something else. For example, if I make ""wall is you"", then walls would be movable. Alternatively, make ""stop is nothing"" or similar. But I need to manipulate the text blocks.

Looking at the current setup, the key is three steps down from the key rule. To get to the key, I need to move through the walls. But since walls are stop, I can't. So the solution must involve moving one of the rules to alter the behavior. Let's see: the rule ""key is win"" is at the far right. If I can get that near the key, but the key is already defined as win. Maybe the door is the win condition, but the active rule says key is win. Wait, no, the door is at 9 right, 4 down. The active rule is key is win, so the goal is still to get the key.

Alternatively, maybe the door is a win if the rule is changed. But first, let's focus on getting the key. To reach the key at 8 right, 3 down, I need to path through the walls. The walls are at 5 right, 2 up; 5 right, 1 up; 5 right; and down to 3 down. So the path to the key is blocked by walls on all sides except maybe down. But the key is 3 steps down from the key rule's position. Wait, the key's position is 8 right, 3 down. From where am I? If I'm at the ""baba"" rule's position, which is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down (from previous observations), but in this latest observation, the ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 steps down. So maybe I'm at 4 steps down. To get to the key at 8 right, 3 down, I need to move right and down. But the walls are there.

Alternatively, perhaps I can move the ""key is win"" rule to the key's location. If I can make the key into a win by placing the ""key is win"" text block next to it, but the key is already defined as win. Maybe that's redundant. Alternatively, if I can make Baba a win by creating ""baba is win"", then reaching Baba would win. But how?

Wait, the active rules are key is win, wall is stop, baba is you. So to win, I need to get the key. But the key is blocked. So the solution is to move the ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else to remove the stop property from walls. For example, if I can make ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"", then walls would be movable. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is. In the current observation, it's at 1 step up. So if I can move that rule to a different position, perhaps adjacent to a wall, then the rule would change.

But how do I move the ""wall is stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. Assuming I'm at the ""baba"" rule's position, which is 4 steps down. The ""wall is stop"" rule is 1 step up from there. So moving up once would get me next to the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, I can move it left or right. If I move it to the left, maybe into a position where it affects a different part of the map.

Alternatively, create a new rule by combining text blocks. For example, if I can move ""is"" and ""you"" together to make ""baba is you"", but that's already a rule. Hmm.

Another approach: since the key is win, but it's blocked by walls, maybe I can push the walls if they're not stop. But walls are stop, so I can't push them. Unless I change their rule.

So the plan is: move the ""wall is stop"" rule away, so walls no longer are stop. Then, I can move through the walls to get to the key. To do that, I need to pick up the ""wall is stop"" text block and move it. Let's see where it is. In the current observation, ""rule `wall` 1 step up"" â€” that's the ""wall is stop"" rule, right? Because the full rule is ""wall is stop"", which is composed of the ""wall"" text block, ""is"" text block, and ""stop"" text block. But in the objects list, it's listed as ""rule `wall` 1 step up"", which probably means the ""wall"" part of the rule is at 1 step up. Then the ""is"" and ""stop"" parts are adjacent.

Assuming that the ""wall is stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""wall"" at 1 step up, ""is"" at 1 step to the right and 1 step up, and ""stop"" at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So to move the entire rule, I need to move one of its components. But in the game, you can move individual text blocks that are part of a rule to rewrite the rule.

So, to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move one of its components away. For example, move the ""stop"" text block to another location. Alternatively, to change the rule to something else, like ""wall is you"", I would need to replace ""stop"" with ""you"".

But where am I currently located? The ""baba is you"" rule is at 4 steps down. So the ""baba"" text block is at 1 step to the left and 4 steps down, ""is"" at 2 step to the left and 4 steps down, and ""you"" at 1 step to the right and 4 steps down. If I'm positioned at the Baba's location, which is likely the ""baba"" text block's position, which is 1 step left and 4 steps down.

So from there, I can move right to reach the ""is"" and ""you"" parts of the ""baba is you"" rule. But I need to get to the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 step up. Let's see the movement needed. From 1 left, 4 down, moving up once would get to 1 left, 3 down. Then, to reach the ""wall"" part of the ""wall is stop"" rule at 1 step up (which is at 0 left, 3 down?), maybe. Wait, the ""rule `wall` 1 step up"" is probably located 1 step up from the current position. If the current position is 1 left, 4 down, then 1 step up would be 1 left, 3 down. But the ""wall"" part of the rule is there. Then the ""is"" part is 1 step to the right and 1 step up, so 0 left, 3 down. And ""stop"" is 2 steps to the right and 1 step up, so -1 left, 3 down.

So to interact with the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move to the ""wall"" part at 1 left, 3 down. But I'm currently at 1 left, 4 down. So moving up once gets me to 1 left, 3 down, which is the ""wall"" part of the rule. Then, I can move that text block. If I move it to the left, it would become ""all is stop"" or something else, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" part to change the rule.

Alternatively, to create a new rule. For example, if I can move ""wall"", ""is"", and ""you"" together to make ""wall is you"". But that would require having those text blocks nearby.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can push the key past the walls by changing the wall's property. But to do that, I need to get rid of the ""wall is stop"" rule.

So the step-by-step plan:

1. Move to the ""wall is stop"" rule's location.
2. Move one of its components (like ""stop"") to another place to rewrite the rule.
3. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.
4. Navigate to the key and pick it up, which is already win, so that would complete the level.

But how exactly to move the text blocks. Let's think about the current positions:

- ""rule `wall`"" (the ""wall"" part of ""wall is stop"") is at 1 step up from Baba's position. So moving up from 1 left, 4 down to 1 left, 3 down (the ""wall"" text block).
- Then, maybe move the ""stop"" text block, which is at -1 left, 3 down (2 steps to the right and 1 step up from the original position).

If I can move the ""stop"" text block to, say, next to the ""key"" rule, maybe I can create a new rule like ""key is stop"", but that doesn't help. Alternatively, move it to create ""stop is key"" or something else.

Alternatively, to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule entirely by moving its components away.

Another approach: since the key is win, and it's located at 8 right, 3 down, perhaps I can move the ""key is win"" rule to be next to the key, but it's already there. The ""key"" text block of the rule is at 8 right, 2 up, which is above the actual key (which is at 8 right, 3 down). So maybe aligning the rule with the key.

But I'm not sure. Let's try to map out the positions more clearly.

Assuming Baba's position is at the ""baba"" rule's location: 1 step left and 4 steps down.

The ""wall is stop"" rule consists of:
- ""wall"" at 1 step up (from Baba's position): 1 left, 3 down.
- ""is"" at 1 step right and 1 step up: 0 left, 3 down.
- ""stop"" at 2 steps right and 1 step up: -1 left, 3 down.

The key is at 8 right, 3 steps down from where? If the key rule is at 8 right, 2 up (from Baba's position), then the actual key is 1 step down from there, so 8 right, 1 up (from Baba's position)? Wait, the key's position is 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. If Baba is at 1 left, 4 down, then the key's absolute position would be 1 left + 8 right = 7 left, 4 down + 3 down = 7 left, 7 down. That seems far. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point, but it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the directions are relative to the player's position. For example, ""right"" means move to the right relative to where the player is facing. But direction is ambiguous unless specified.

Given the complexity, maybe the simplest solution is to move the ""wall is stop"" rule out of the way. So, from Baba's position at 1 left, 4 down, move up to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule. Then, move the ""stop"" text block to a different location, say, to the left, so the rule becomes ""wall is "" (incomplete), which would remove the rule. Alternatively, replace ""stop"" with another property.

But to move the ""stop"" text block, which is at -1 left, 3 down, I need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position at 1 left, 4 down, moving up to 1 left, 3 down (the ""wall"" part), then right to 0 left, 3 down (the ""is"" part), then right again to -1 left, 3 down (the ""stop"" part). Once there, I can move the ""stop"" block left or right.

If I move the ""stop"" block to the left (2 steps left), it would be at -3 left, 3 down. This would break the ""wall is stop"" rule, effectively removing it. Now, walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them.

Once that's done, I can move right past the walls to the key's location at 8 right, 3 down. But how to navigate there? The key is probably several steps to the right and down from the current position. After removing the ""wall is stop"" rule, the walls are passable, so I can move right and down as needed.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes Baba a win. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would win the level. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" parts to create that rule.

The ""win"" part of the ""key is win"" rule is at 10 right, 2 up. The ""is"" part is at 9 right, 2 up. So if I can move ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together, I can create ""baba is win"".

Baba's text blocks are at 1 left, 4 down (baba), 2 left, 4 down (is), and 1 right, 4 down (you). So to create ""baba is win"", I need to take the ""is"" from 2 left, 4 down and ""win"" from 10 right, 2 up, and place them next to ""baba"".

But that would require moving those text blocks, which are far away. It's more feasible to first remove the ""wall is stop"" rule to gain access to the key.

So the step-by-step actions would be:

1. Move from Baba's position (1 left, 4 down) up to the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Move the ""stop"" text block away to delete the rule.
3. Move right past the now-passable walls to the key.
4. Pick up the key (since key is win) to win the level.

But how to translate this into actual game actions. Each action is a single move: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Assuming the player is at the ""baba"" text block's position (1 left, 4 down), the first move would be to go up once to reach 1 left, 3 down (the ""wall"" part of the rule). Then, move right to reach the ""is"" part at 0 left, 3 down. Then, move right again to reach the ""stop"" part at -1 left, 3 down. Once there, move left to take the ""stop"" block away. This would remove the ""wall is stop"" rule.

After that, the player can move right through the walls. From the original position (1 left, 4 down), moving right multiple times towards the key's location at 8 right, 3 down. However, the exact path needs to be navigated carefully, avoiding other walls, but now that walls are not stop, they can be passed.

But the problem is that each action is a single step. So the agent needs to output a sequence of steps, but the system expects a single action per observation. Given that, the agent needs to choose the next immediate action based on the current state.

In the latest observation, the agent previously tried moving left multiple times, but the system defaulted to idle due to invalid actions. Now, the correct approach is to move towards the ""wall is stop"" rule and manipulate it.

Assuming the current position is such that the agent can move up to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule, the next action should be 'up' to get closer. Then, once adjacent to the ""stop"" text block, move left or right to delete it.

But based on the latest observation, the agent needs to output a single action. Given that the previous actions failed due to not specifying a valid direction, the correct action now is to move 'up' to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule's location.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, to win, I need to get the key, but since the key is defined as win, maybe touching it makes me win? But there's also walls that are stop, so I have to avoid them.

Looking at the objects, I see a door at 9 steps right and 5 steps down. But how do I reach it? The key is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. If I can get the key, maybe that triggers the win condition. But the path to the key might be blocked by walls. 

I am Baba, since ""baba is you"". So I can move around unless I hit a wall. The walls are all aligned to the right, but there's a rule that says ""wall is stop"", meaning any object labeled wall can't be passed. Let me check the map layout again.

From the current observation, after moving up, my position must have changed. Let's see: the walls are mostly to the right and down. The key is at 8 right, 4 down. To get there, I need to move down from my current position. But wait, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make that wall not a stop.

The rules available are the ones on the map. There's a ""rule `wall` 1 step up"" and others. If I can move the ""wall"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the stop property from the walls blocking my path. For example, if I take the ""wall is stop"" rule and move it, then walls wouldn't be stop anymore. But how do I do that? I need to pick up the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" and rearrange them.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe just grabbing the key is enough. But how to get past the walls. Let's think. If I can change the ""wall is stop"" rule, perhaps to ""wall is you"" or something else, then walls wouldn't block me. But I need to move the existing rules. 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 1 step up, and another rule `is` at 1 step to the right, and `stop` at 2 steps right. If I can move these to create a new rule, like ""stop is wall"" or ""wall is not stop"", but the game allows creating new rules by combining subject, is, and property. 

Wait, the key is win, so if I can take the key, maybe that's the solution. The key is at 8 right, 4 down. From my current position, which is after moving up once, maybe I'm at 5 steps right and 1 step up. To get to the key, I need to move right, down, etc. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe I need to remove that wall's stop property.

To do that, I need to find the rule that makes it a stop. The active rule is ""wall is stop"". So if I can move the ""stop"" rule away or change it, the walls won't block. But how? The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right. If I can pick that up and move it elsewhere, like next to a wall, to create a new rule. For example, moving ""stop"" to be part of another rule. 

Alternatively, create a rule like ""stop is key"" or something, but that might not help. The main idea is to eliminate the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can take the ""wall"" and ""is"" and ""stop"" text blocks and rearrange them into something else, like ""stop is you"" or ""wall is push"", then the walls wouldn't block. 

Let me check the available text blocks. There's rule `wall` at 1 step up, rule `is` at 1 step right, rule `stop` at 2 steps right. Also, there are other rules like ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So perhaps I can take the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" blocks and move them to create a new rule that changes the wall's property. For example, moving them to form ""wall is you"", making walls controllable. Then I could walk through them. 

But to do that, I need to move those text blocks. The problem is that I can only move objects that are not stop. Since I'm Baba (you), and walls are stop, I can't move the wall objects themselves, only the text blocks. So I need to navigate to the text blocks and move them. 

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right. To get there, from my current position (assuming after moving up, maybe at 5 right, 1 up), I need to move left to 2 steps right. But wait, walls are to the right, so moving left might be safer. Let's see: current position isn't specified, but based on previous observations, after moving up, the position might be adjusted. 

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to move the ""stop"" rule away. If I can take the ""stop"" text block and place it somewhere else, like next to a different subject, to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""stop"" next to ""key"", making ""key is stop"", but that would make the key a stop, which is bad. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, create ""stop is win"", but that might not help. The main goal is to eliminate the ""wall is stop"" rule. So perhaps I need to move the ""stop"" rule off the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can break apart that rule by moving ""stop"" away, then the rule ""wall is stop"" would no longer exist. 

So the steps would be: 
1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right.
2. Pick it up (since it's a text block, not a wall) and move it somewhere else, like next to a different rule. For example, place it next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is stop"", but that would make Baba a stop, which is bad. 
Alternatively, place it next to ""key"" to make ""key is stop"", but that's also bad. 

Wait, maybe the better approach is to create a new rule that negates ""wall is stop"". For example, ""stop is wall"" but that doesn't change anything. Or ""wall is not stop"", but the game might not allow such rules. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule. There's a rule `is` at 1 step right. If I can combine ""wall"", ""is"", and something else to make a new rule. For example, ""wall is you"", making walls controllable. 

So the plan is: 
- Move to the ""wall"" rule at 1 step up.
- Move to the ""is"" rule at 1 step right.
- Move to the ""you"" rule (if available) to combine them into ""wall is you"". 

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `you` at 2 steps right and 4 steps down. So maybe I need to gather those text blocks. 

But navigating through the walls might be tricky. Since walls are stop, I can't move through them. So I need to find a path that avoids walls by moving around them, using the fact that I'm Baba (you), but walls are stop. 

Alternatively, if I can change the walls to not be stop, then I can walk through them. 

Let me try to outline the steps again:

1. Identify all relevant text blocks: ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", ""key"", ""win"", ""baba"", ""you"".
2. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"".
3. The goal is to get to the door, which is probably behind the walls. 
4. To pass through walls, either change their property or find a way around.

Possible actions:

- Move towards the key to grab it, but blocked by walls.
- Rearrange the rules to remove ""wall is stop"".

To rearrange the rules:

- Need to move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how? Since the ""wall is stop"" is formed by the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" placed together. If I can move any of these blocks, the rule breaks. 

For example, if I take the ""stop"" block from ""wall is stop"" and move it elsewhere, the rule is destroyed. Then walls are no longer stop, so I can walk through them. 

So the steps would be:

a. Move to the ""stop"" text block at 2 steps right.
b. Pick it up (since it's not a wall) and move it to a different location, say next to ""baba"" to create ""baba is stop"", but that's bad. Alternatively, move it next to ""key"" to make ""key is stop"", which is also bad. 

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block to a place where it doesn't form a rule. For example, move it far away from the other text blocks so no rule is formed. 

Once ""wall is stop"" is destroyed, walls are just normal objects and can be walked over. Then I can path to the key and grab it, since key is win. 

So the action plan is:

1. Navigate to the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right.
2. Move the ""stop"" text block away from the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Now, walls are not stop, so walk through them to the key.
4. Grab the key, which makes me win since ""key is win"".

But how to move the ""stop"" block. Let's see the current position. After previous moves, maybe I'm at 5 steps right and 1 step up. The ""stop"" block is at 2 steps right. So from here, I need to move left 3 steps to reach the ""stop"" block. But moving left through walls? Wait, walls are to the right, so moving left would be towards the left side, which might be clear. 

But the walls are at 5 steps right and various down positions. Moving left from 5 right to 2 right would be moving left through open space, not through walls. So that's possible. 

So the first action is to move left three times to reach the ""stop"" block at 2 steps right. Then pick it up and move it away. 

Once ""stop"" is moved, the ""wall is stop"" rule is broken. Then I can move freely through walls. 

After that, go to the key at 8 right, 4 down. The path would be right, down, etc., avoiding walls (but since they're no longer stop, I can walk through them). 

Then grab the key, which triggers the ""key is win"" rule, so I win. 

So the immediate action is to move left towards the ""stop"" block.

I need to figure out how to get to the door in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current rules and the objects on the map.

The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means whatever has ""key"" is now the win condition, so grabbing the key would make me win. But wait, the original rule is ""key is win"", so stepping on the key should make me win. Also, since ""baba is you"", I'm Baba, so I can move around.

Looking at the objects, there's a door at 9 steps to the right and 5 steps down. But between me (I assume I'm Baba, which is at the starting position, maybe 0,0?) and the door, there are walls and other obstacles. Let me parse the positions again.

The key is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. So, to get there, I need to move right and down. But there are walls at 5 steps right and varying down positions. Also, the rule ""wall is stop"" was present earlier, but looking at the current active rules, it's not listed anymore. Wait, in the last observation, the active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So maybe the ""wall is stop"" rule was modified or removed.

Wait, in the previous steps, there was a ""wall is stop"" rule, but now it's not active. That's important. If walls are no longer stop, then I can walk through them? Or did the rule get changed? Let me check the observation again. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So ""wall is stop"" must have been altered or deleted. Maybe by moving some text blocks. For example, if there was a rule ""wall is stop"" and someone moved ""stop"" to a different position, making that rule invalid.

So, if walls are not stop anymore, I can walk through them. That changes everything. So the path to the key and door might be blocked by walls, but since walls don't stop me now, I can just walk through them. But wait, the key is at 8 right, 4 down. Let me visualize the map.

Starting position (assuming I'm Baba at the initial position, maybe where the ""baba"" rule is? Or perhaps where the ""you"" rule is placed? The rules on the map include ""rule `baba` 5 steps down"" and ""rule `is` 1 step to the right and 5 steps down"", ""rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 5 steps down"". So maybe the Baba text block is at 5 steps down, and I'm attached to that? Not sure. But I need to move to the key at 8 right, 4 down.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 5 steps right and various down positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 steps down). But if walls are not stop, I can walk through them. So the path from my current position to the key would be:

From wherever I am, need to move right to 8 steps right and down to 4 steps down. Let's see the obstacles. The walls are at 5 steps right, but the key is at 8 steps right, which is past the 5 steps right wall. So moving right past 5 steps right, then continuing right to 8. But since walls are not stop, I can go through them. Wait, but the walls are at 5 steps right and 1,2,3,4,5 down. So if I'm at, say, position (0,0), moving right to 5 steps right would take me to (5,0), but there's a wall there. But since walls don't stop me, I can walk through. Then continue right to 8 steps right. Then move down to 4 steps down. The key is there, so stepping on it would make me win. Alternatively, maybe the door is at 9 right and 5 down, which is past the 5 steps right wall again. But again, if walls don't stop, I can walk through.

Wait, but the current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the win condition is the key. So I just need to reach the key. Let me check the key's position: 8 steps right and 4 steps down. My current position isn't explicitly stated, but looking at the objects, the ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 steps down. Maybe I'm at that position? Or perhaps I'm where the ""you"" rule is, which is 2 steps to the right and 5 steps down. That might be the case. If I'm at the ""you"" rule's position (2 right, 5 down), then to get to the key (8 right, 4 down), I need to move left twice to get to 6 right, then down one to 4 down? Wait, no. From 2 right, 5 down, moving left would decrease the right steps. But the key is at 8 right, which is further to the right. So maybe I'm elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is not listed among the objects, so I have to infer. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", so the player is Baba. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 steps down. Maybe that's the position of the Baba text block, and the player is at that location. So starting at 5 steps down, and to reach the key at 8 right, 4 down, I need to move right 3 steps and down 1 step. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 5 down, but that's below the key's position. Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right and 1,2,3,4,5 steps down. So the wall spans from 5 right,1 down to 5 right,5 down. So if I'm at 5 steps down (the position of the ""baba"" rule), moving down further would be into the wall area. But since walls don't stop me, maybe I can move through them.

But the key is at 8 right, 4 down. So from the ""baba"" rule at 5 steps down, I need to move right to 8 right and down to 4 down. Let's break it down:

Current position (assuming at ""rule `baba`"" which is at 5 steps down):

To get to 8 right, need to move right 3 times (since 5 steps down's right coordinate isn't clear. Maybe the ""rule `baba`"" is at a specific (x,y) position. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think in terms of the grid based on the steps given.

Each object's position is relative to the player's position. For example, ""wall 2 steps to the right and 2 step up"" means that from the player's position, there's a wall at (2, -2) if up is negative y. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the origin (0,0), and all other positions are relative to that.

Assuming the player is at (0,0):

- The ""rule `wall` 1 step up"" is at (0, 1).
- The wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up is at (5, -1) (since up is negative y).
- The key is at (8, -4).
- The door is at (9, -5).

But the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the player is Baba, and the win condition is the key. So the plan is to move to (8, -4).

Now, obstacles: walls at (5, -1), (5,0), (5,-1), (5,-2), (5,-3), (5,-4), (5,-5). But since ""wall is stop"" is no longer an active rule, those walls are just regular objects and don't block movement. So the player can walk through them.

So the path from (0,0) to (8,-4) would be:

Right 8 steps, down 4 steps. But along the way, passing through the walls at x=5, but since they don't stop movement, it's allowed.

Alternatively, maybe the player's starting position is not at (0,0). Let's look for the ""baba"" rule. The ""rule `baba`"" is at 5 steps down. If that's the position of the Baba text block, then perhaps the player is at that location. So the ""rule `baba`"" is a text block that defines Baba's properties. But in Baba Is You, the player is usually the Baba object, not the rule. So maybe the player is at the position where the ""you"" rule is applied. The ""rule `you`"" is at 2 steps to the right and 5 steps down. So that would be the player's position: (2, -5).

From there, to reach the key at (8, -4):

Need to move right (8-2)=6 steps and up 1 step (since -4 is up from -5). So right 6, up 1.

But along the way, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 steps down (which is (5, -4)), but since walls don't stop, it's okay.

So moving right from (2,-5) to (8,-5), then up to (8,-4). That should reach the key.

Once the key is stepped on, since ""key is win"", the player wins.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at (9,-5), which is past the key. But the key is the win condition now, so getting the key is sufficient.

So the actions needed are:

1. Move right 6 times from (2,-5) to (8,-5).
2. Move up 1 time to (8,-4), which is the key.

But how to represent this in the game's action commands. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, idle.

So the sequence would be right, right, right, right, right, right, up.

But the agent needs to output one action at a time. So the first action should be right, then repeat.

But in the current observation, after moving right several times, the player would be at the key's x position but still need to move up.

Wait, let's check the current observation again. The last observation before this one had the door at 9 steps right and 5 steps down, and the key at 8 right and 4 down. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"".

Assuming the player is at (2,-5) (the position of the ""you"" rule), moving right 6 times gets to (8,-5), then up once to (8,-4), which is the key. Stepping on the key would trigger the win condition.

But I need to confirm the player's current position. Since the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 5 steps down, that's likely where the player is.

So the next action is to move right. Then repeat right until reaching x=8, then up.

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means touching the key makes me win, right? Because ""key is win"" changes the win condition. But ""baba is you"" means I can move as Baba.

Looking at the map, there's a key located at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down, and another wall at 5 steps down. So the path to the key is blocked by walls. The door is at 8 steps right and 5 steps down, but I need to get past those walls.

Wait, the rules also include ""stop"" which is at 2 steps to the right. So any wall is stop. Maybe I can move the rules to change what's stop. Let me check the objects. There's a rule ""wall"" at 1 step left and 1 step up. If I can move that ""wall is stop"" rule somewhere else, maybe I can remove the stop property from walls.

But how do I move the rules? I need to be next to a text block and move it. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"", I can push objects that aren't stop. The walls are stop, so I can't move them. But the rules like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", etc., can I move those?

Looking at the current position, where is Baba? The last observation didn't specify Baba's position, but assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe near the lower part. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. The door is further right. The walls are forming a barrier. 

If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. Let's see. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps to the right. If I can move that rule somewhere else, like next to a wall, maybe I can change the property. For example, if I move ""stop"" to be part of a different rule, like ""wall is not stop"", but I need to create a new rule.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the existing rules to make ""wall"" something else. Like changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" or something. But how? I need to move the ""wall"" rule and the ""stop"" rule.

Wait, the rules are in pairs: ""Subject IS Property"". So ""wall IS stop"" is a rule. If I can move the ""wall"" text block next to a different property, like ""push"", then it would create ""wall IS push"", making walls movable. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right. If I can move the ""wall"" rule (which is at 1 left, 1 up) and the ""stop"" rule to be adjacent, maybe I can form a new rule. Let's see the positions:

- ""wall"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up.
- ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right.

If I move towards the ""stop"" rule, maybe I can push it? Wait, can I move the ""stop"" rule? Since it's a rule, and rules are objects unless they're part of an active rule that makes them stop. The current active rules don't make rules stop, except ""wall is stop"". So the ""stop"" rule itself isn't stopped unless it's on a wall. But it's at 2 steps right, which is a wall?

Wait, there's a wall at 4 steps right. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right, which is not on a wall. So I can move the ""stop"" rule. Similarly, the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. Maybe I can move these rules to create a new rule that removes the stop property from walls.

Alternatively, maybe I need to get to the key first. But the path is blocked. Let's think differently. Since the key is the win condition, maybe I can push the key over the walls? But walls are stop, so I can't move them. Unless I change the stop property.

Another approach: Maybe I can make myself a key. Since ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"", if I can make ""baba is key"", then touching Baba (me) would make me a key, which is win. So creating the rule ""baba is key"" would make me win upon touching. 

To do that, I need to move the ""baba"" rule and the ""key"" rule together. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 5 steps down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. That's a bit far. Maybe there's a way to bring them closer.

Alternatively, the ""you"" rule is at 2 steps right and 5 steps down. If I can change ""you"" to ""key"", then since I'm you, I'd be key. So creating ""you is key"" would make me key. But the current ""you"" rule is part of ""baba is you"". Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""you"" rule is a separate object at 2 steps right and 5 steps down. 

So if I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""key"" rule, I can create ""you is key"". That way, since I'm you, I become key, which means touching me wins. So the plan is: move the ""you"" rule to be next to the ""key"" rule, forming ""you is key"".

Looking at the positions:

- ""you"" rule is at 1 step right and 5 steps down.
- ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up.

That's quite a distance. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, look at the current position of Baba. If I'm at 4 steps right and 5 steps down (door's position?), but not sure. Let's assume I need to navigate to the ""you"" rule and ""key"" rule.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rules to connect ""baba"" with ""key"". The ""is"" rule at 5 steps down could be used. If I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then next to ""key"", that would create ""baba is key"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 5 steps down. The ""is"" rule is at 5 steps down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 steps right and 1 step up. Hmm, coordinates are a bit confusing. Maybe need to visualize the grid.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""stop"" rule out of the way. If I can move the ""stop"" rule from 2 steps right to somewhere else, then the walls might not block me. But where to move it? If I can move it to a position where it's not affecting anything, like next to a non-wall.

But how to move it? Since I'm Baba, and I can move objects that are not stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, but unless it's defined as stop by a rule, it's movable. Wait, the current active rule is ""wall is stop"", so walls are stop, but the ""stop"" rule itself is just a text block. So I can move it.

So, the plan: move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, say next to a wall, to create a new rule that changes the property of the wall. For example, moving ""stop"" next to ""wall"" would create ""wall is stop"" again, which doesn't help. Alternatively, move ""stop"" next to ""key"" to make ""key is stop"", but that's bad because then the key would be stop.

Alternatively, move ""stop"" to a different subject. Like, move ""stop"" next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is stop"", which would make me stop, preventing me from moving. Not good.

Hmm. Maybe the better approach is to create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, if I can create ""wall is push"", then I can move walls. But to do that, I need to rearrange the ""wall"" and ""push"" rules. But there's no ""push"" rule in the current objects. Wait, the available rules are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", ""stop"", ""baba"", ""you"".

So, to make ""wall is push"", I need a ""push"" property. But there's no ""push"" rule. Unless I can create a new rule by combining existing ones. Not sure.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" rules to link ""wall"" to a different property. For example, move the ""wall"" rule next to the ""stop"" rule to reinforce ""wall is stop"", but that's already the case.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules are just objects on the map that can be rearranged. So maybe the solution is to delete the ""wall is stop"" rule. But how? You can't delete rules, only move them. If you move them away, they're no longer active.

So if I move the ""wall"" rule and the ""stop"" rule away from each other, the ""wall is stop"" rule becomes inactive. For example, if the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left 1 up, and the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a different position not adjacent to ""wall"", then the ""wall is stop"" rule is removed.

So the plan: move the ""stop"" rule to a location that's not next to the ""wall"" rule. For instance, move it down or left. Once that's done, walls are no longer stop, so I can push them or move through them.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps to the right. If I'm at that position, I can move left, right, up, or down. But where is Baba located? The last observation didn't specify, but assuming I'm near the lower part, maybe at 4 steps right and 5 steps down (door's position). 

If I need to get to the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right, I have to navigate through the walls. But the path is blocked. Unless I change the wall's property first. It's a catch-22.

Alternative idea: Since the key is the win condition, and it's located at 7 right, 4 down, maybe I can push the key past the walls by making walls passable. But to do that, I need to remove ""wall is stop"".

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule to deactivate ""wall is stop"".
2. Then, move the key to a position where I can reach it, possibly by pushing walls if they're no longer stop.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Let's see. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it. Suppose I'm at 3 steps right, 1 step up. Then I can move left into the ""stop"" rule and push it further left.

Wait, the ""stop"" rule's position is 2 steps to the right. Let me check the grid again. The current objects include:

- rule `stop` 1 step to the right and 1 step up.

Wait, no, in the last observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps to the right. Let me confirm:

In the latest observation before the current one, the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So its position is (assuming current position is origin), right 2, up 1.

To move it, I need to be adjacent. If I'm at right 2, up 1, I can move in any direction. But what's there? To the left is the ""wall"" rule at 1 step left and 1 step up (which is actually at (-1,1) if origin is here). Wait, coordinates might be tricky. Maybe it's better to think in terms of relative positions.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""stop"" rule to the left. If I can move it left past the ""wall"" rule, then the ""wall is stop"" rule would be broken. For example, if the ""wall"" rule is at 1 left 1 up, and the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right 1 up, moving the ""stop"" rule left to 1 right 1 up would place it next to the ""wall"" rule, but that's still ""wall is stop"". To break it, need to move them apart.

So, move the ""stop"" rule from (2 right, 1 up) to (3 right, 1 up), then it's no longer adjacent to the ""wall"" rule at (1 left, 1 up). Wait, no, coordinates might be relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should try specific actions.

Suppose I'm at the position of Baba. Let's assume I'm near the door at 9 steps right and 5 steps down, but not sure. Alternatively, the key is at 7 right, 4 down. Maybe I'm nearby.

The key is at 7 right, 4 down. To get there, I need to move right and down, but there's a wall at 4 right, 4 down. If walls are stop, I can't move through them. So I need to make walls passable.

So the priority is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule. To do that, move the ""stop"" rule away from the ""wall"" rule.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 1 up. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left, 1 up. So they are adjacent horizontally. If I can move the ""stop"" rule down or up, away from the ""wall"" rule.

For example, move the ""stop"" rule down one step. That would make it 2 right, 2 up. Now, it's not adjacent to the ""wall"" rule at 1 left, 1 up. Thus, the ""wall is stop"" rule is deactivated. Then, walls are no longer stop, and I can move through them or push them.

Once walls are passable, I can navigate around them to get to the key.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule down from (2 right, 1 up) to (2 right, 2 up).
2. Now, walls are not stop, so I can move through them.
3. Head to the key at (7 right, 4 down), pushing any walls in the way if needed.

But how to execute step 1? To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the desired direction.

Assuming I'm at (2 right, 1 up), adjacent to the ""stop"" rule. Then, moving down would take me to (2 right, 2 up), pushing the ""stop"" rule there.

But where is Baba located? If I'm not at that position, I need to move there first. Suppose I'm at (4 right, 5 down) near the door. To get to the ""stop"" rule at (2 right, 1 up), I need to move left and up. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 3 right, 1 up, there's a wall. So I can't go through.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: create a new rule that makes ""baba"" able to move through walls. Like ""baba is push"" or ""baba is not stop"". To do that, I need to rearrange the existing rules.

The ""is"" rule is present. For example, if I can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then next to ""push"", but there's no ""push"" rule. Alternatively, use ""win"" or ""key"".

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules are ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc., as objects on the map. So maybe create ""baba is win"" to make touching me win, but that's already handled by ""key is win"".

Alternatively, create ""baba is stop"" which would make me stop, but that's bad.

Alternatively, create ""baba is key"" as I thought before. To do that, need to move ""baba"" rule next to ""is"" and then next to ""key"".

The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left, 5 down. The ""is"" rule is at 5 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 1 up. So the distance is large. Maybe I can move the ""is"" rule somewhere in between.

Alternatively, focus on the ""you"" rule. Since I'm you, if I can make ""you is key"", then touching me (as you) would make me key, which is win. The ""you"" rule is at 2 right, 5 down. The ""key"" rule is at 7 right, 1 up. If I can move the ""you"" rule next to the ""key"" rule, that would create ""you is key"".

To do that, I need to navigate the ""you"" rule to near the ""key"" rule. But the path is blocked by walls. Unless I make walls passable.

This is a loop. It seems like the key solution is to remove the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" rule away. Let's try that.

Assuming I can reach the ""stop"" rule at 2 right, 1 up. If I move down, then the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 2 up. Now, ""wall is stop"" is no longer active. Then, I can move through walls.

Once that's done, go to the key at 7 right, 4 down. The path from 4 right, current position (assuming I'm at 4 right, 5 down) would involve moving right and down, but the walls at 4 right, 4 down are now passable. So I can move through them.

Alternatively, push the walls if they are movable. Since walls are no longer stop, I can push them. But I need to check if they're stop. If ""wall is stop"" is removed, then walls are just objects, so I can move them.

So the plan is:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule down to deactivate ""wall is stop"".
2. Navigate to the key, possibly pushing walls if needed.
3. Grab the key to win.

But how to execute step 1? The action needed is to move the ""stop"" rule. To do that, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the desired direction.","

door 8 steps to the right and 5 steps down",0,False
36,up,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure this out. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the key becomes the win condition, and since I'm Baba, I can move around. The goal is to get the key because it's considered win now.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. But there's a wall at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down, which is a stop. So I can't go straight right. Maybe I need to rearrange some rules or move objects to get past the wall.

Wait, the rules for wall are at 1 step left and 1 step up. But maybe I can move those rules. However, the rule ""stop"" is at 2 steps to the right, which might make things immovable. Let me check the positions again.

I'm currently at Baba's position, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down. The key is 7 steps right and 4 down from there. The door is at 8 steps right and 5 down. But the key is the win condition, so getting it should be enough.

To reach the key, I need to move right past the walls. The wall at 4 steps right and 4 down is stopping me. Maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to change what's stop. If I can make stop something else, like the door, then the wall might not block me anymore.

But how do I move the rules? The rules are objects too. The ""wall"" rule is at 1 left and 1 up. The ""is"" next to it. To move them, I have to be adjacent and not hit a stop. Let me see. From my current position (1 left, 5 down), maybe I can move up to reach those rules. Let's see, moving up once gets me to 1 left, 4 down. Then maybe move right to get to the wall rule. But I need to check if the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the key closer. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. If I can move it by pushing it, but since it's a key and the rule says key is win, maybe I can move it if it's not stopped. But the wall at 4 right,4 down is a stop, so pushing the key past that would be blocked. Unless I remove the stop property from the wall.

Wait, the rules are ""wall is stop"". If I can change that to something else, like ""wall is nothing"", then the wall won't block. To do that, I need to move the ""wall is stop"" text block. The rule is at 1 left,1 up. If I can get there and rearrange them. Let me think about the movement.

From my position (1 left,5 down), moving up once gets to 1 left,4 down. Then right to 0 left,4 down. Then up to 0 left,3 down. Then right to 1 right,3 down. Then up to 1 right,2 down. Then right to 2 right,2 down. Then up to 2 right,1 down. Then right to 3 right,1 down. Then up to 3 right,0 down (assuming down is the starting point). Wait, maybe the coordinate system is a bit different. The observations mention steps up, down, left, right relative to the player's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the starting position, and objects are relative. The key is 7 steps right and 4 down from the player. The walls are forming a corridor. The door is at 8 right,5 down. To get to the key, the player needs to navigate around the walls. The problem is the wall at 4 right,4 down, which is a stop. So moving right past that is impossible unless the stop rule is changed.

So the plan is: move the ""wall is stop"" rule to change the stop property. Then the wall won't block. To do that, I need to pick up the ""wall"" rule and the ""is"" and ""stop"" text blocks. But how?

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 1 step up from the player. So to reach there, the player needs to move left and up. From current position (assuming starting at 0,0), moving left once to (-1,0), then up to (-1,1). Then interact with the ""wall"" rule there. But wait, the player's position might be different based on the map. The observation says the rule 'baba' is at 1 step left and 4 steps down. So maybe the player is at (0,0), and the 'baba' rule is at (-1,4). So to get to the 'wall' rule at (-1,1), the player needs to move down from their current position.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me visualize the map based on the latest observation.

The active rules are key is win and baba is you. The objects include:

- rule `wall` at 1 step to the left and 1 step up from somewhere.
- wall objects at various positions, like 4 steps right and 1 up, 4 steps right, etc.
- key at 7 right,4 down.
- door at 8 right,5 down.

Assuming the player is at Baba's position, which is 1 step left and 5 steps down from the key's position. So if the key is at (7,4), then Baba is at (7 -1, 4 +5) = (6,9)? Not sure. Maybe the coordinate system is relative. Alternatively, the player's position is the starting point, and all other objects are relative to them.

In any case, the key is to the right and down from the player. The wall at 4 right,4 down is blocking the path. To remove that wall's stop property, I need to edit the rules. The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 1 left,1 up. So the player needs to move to that position, pick up the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" text blocks, and rearrange them to something else, like ""wall is nothing"" or ""stop is door"".

So the steps would be:

1. Move left and up to reach the ""wall is stop"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" blocks.
3. Re Arrange them to create a new rule, like ""stop is key"" or ""wall is you"", so that the wall isn't a stop anymore.
4. Then move right past the wall to reach the key.

But how to do this in actions? The player can move in directions and interact with adjacent text blocks to create new rules.

In the latest observation, the player's position is where the 'baba' rule is: 1 step left and 5 steps down. So to get to the 'wall' rule at 1 left and 1 up, the player needs to move down twice (since 5 down to 1 down is moving down 4 steps? Not sure. Maybe the coordinate system is such that moving down increases the down count. So from 5 down to 1 down would be moving up 4 steps. But the 'wall' rule is 1 left and 1 up from the player's current position. So the player is at (0,0), and the 'wall' rule is at (-1,1). So to get there, move left once and up once.

Once there, the player can pick up the 'wall', 'is', and 'stop' blocks and move them to create a new rule. For example, move 'stop' to 'key' so that 'stop is key', making the wall not a stop.

But the player needs to move the text blocks adjacent to each other to form a new rule. So after rearranging, the new rule would be ""stop is key"", which changes the stop property to key. Then the wall at 4 right,4 down is no longer a stop, allowing the player to pass.

Once that's done, the player can move right past the wall to the key at 7 right,4 down, pick it up (since key is win), and win the level.

So the sequence of actions would be:

- Move left to reach the 'wall' rule's position.
- Move up to get to the exact location.
- Pick up the 'wall', 'is', and 'stop' blocks.
- Rearrange them to form ""stop is key"".
- Then move right towards the key.

But in the current observation, after previous failed actions, the player might be in a position where they can perform these moves. Let's check the last observation before the current one.

In the previous observation, after moving left, the player's position might have changed. The latest observation shows that after some left movements, the player is now at a position where the 'wall' rule is 1 left and 1 up. So the player needs to move there.

The current observation's active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects include the 'wall' rule at 1 left,1 up. So the plan is to move to that position, rearrange the rules.

So the next action should be moving left and up to reach the rule. But how to express that in a single action? Each action is a single step: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Wait, the player can only move one step at a time. So to get from their current position (assuming they were moving left previously) to the 'wall' rule at 1 left,1 up, they might need to move up first then left, or left then up.

In the current observation, the player's position is where the 'baba' rule is: 1 step left and 5 steps down. The 'wall' rule is 1 left and 1 up. So the player is at ( -1, 5 ), and the 'wall' rule is at ( -1, 1 ). So the player needs to move up 4 steps to get there. But each action is one step. However, in the previous steps, the assistant kept moving left, which might have moved them away. Wait, the user's previous actions were left, right, up, etc., but the observations showed that the player's position relative to the rules was changing. It's possible that after several left moves, the player is now adjacent to the 'wall' rule.

Alternatively, maybe the player is next to the 'wall' rule and can pick it up. For example, if the 'wall' rule is one step left and one step up from the player's current position, then moving up once would get them to the same row, then left once to be adjacent.

But given the complexity, perhaps the best immediate action is to move up to get closer to the 'wall' rule's location. Alternatively, move left if that's the direction needed.

In the latest observation, the 'wall' rule is 1 step to the left and 1 step up from the player's current position (as per the 'baba' rule's position). So the player is at (0,0), and the 'wall' rule is at (-1,1). To reach there, the player needs to move left once and up once. But since each action is a single step, they need to do that in two actions. However, the assistant can only output one action per step.

So the first step would be to move up from the player's current position to get to (0,1), then move left to (-1,1), where the 'wall' rule is. Once there, they can interact with the text blocks to rearrange them.

But in the current observation, after previous actions, the player might already be in a position to do that. For example, if they moved left multiple times, they might be adjacent to the rule.

Alternatively, maybe the player is already adjacent and needs to pick up the 'wall' rule. But the problem is that the assistant has to output a single action: up, down, left, right, or idle.

Given that, the best action right now is to move up to get closer to the 'wall' rule's location. Because the rule is 1 step up from the player's current position (1 left,5 down), moving up would reduce the vertical distance.

Wait, the 'wall' rule is 1 step left and 1 step up from the player's position. So if the player is at (0,0), the 'wall' rule is at (-1,1). To get there, move left once to (-1,0), then up once to (-1,1). But since each action is a step, the player needs to do that in two moves. However, in the current observation, after previous actions, perhaps the player is already at (-1,0), so moving up would get them to (-1,1), where the 'wall' rule is.

In that case, the action should be up.

Alternatively, if the player is already at (-1,1), then they can start rearranging the text blocks. But the observation doesn't specify the player's current position, only the objects relative to it. So the assistant has to infer based on previous actions and observations.

Given the latest observation, the active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The objects include the 'wall' rule at 1 left,1 up. So the player needs to move to that position. The most logical action is to move up to get closer. Once they're adjacent, they can pick up the text blocks. But since the assistant can only output one action, the next step is to move up.

37,down,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The goal is to get to the door, which is usually ""win"", but in this level, the rule says ""key is win"", so I need to get the key and then maybe use it to open something? Or perhaps the key itself is the win condition.

Looking at the active rules: ""key is win"" means that if I can make the key the thing that I am, then touching it would win. Also, ""baba is you"", so I'm Baba. The walls are still stop, so I can't move through them.

The objects on the map: There's a key located at 7 steps to the right and 5 steps down. There's a door at 8 steps to the right and 6 steps down. But the door might be behind walls or require the key. Also, there are rules for wall, key, win, etc., scattered around.

My current position isn't specified, but I assume I'm at Baba's position, which is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down according to the last rule block. So I need to move from there to the key.

The path to the key: Let's see. From Baba's position (1 left, 6 down), I need to go right to reach the key at 7 right, 5 down. But the way might be blocked. Looking at the walls: There's a wall at 4 steps right and various downs. The key is at 7 right, 5 down. So moving right from Baba's position: From 1 left to 4 right would require moving right 5 steps, but there's a wall at 4 right. Wait, the walls are at 4 steps right at various positions. Let me map this out.

Baba's position: rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So maybe my position is at (0,6) if left is negative x, and down is negative y. The key is at (7,5). So to get there, I need to move right towards 7 on the x-axis. But between here and the key, there are walls at 4 steps right, which could be at different y positions. Let me check:

Wall at 4 right and 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc., up to 6 steps down. So from my position at (1 left, 6 down), moving right towards 7 right would pass through x=2,3,4. But at x=4, there are walls at y=1,2,3,4,5,6 down. Wait, the wall at 4 steps right and 6 steps down is there. So if I go right to x=4, y=6, that's a wall. So I can't go straight right past x=4.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move up or down to avoid the walls. Let's see. From Baba's position (1 left, 6 down), moving up would decrease the y-coordinate (if down is negative). So moving up once would be y=5. Let's see if there's a path there.

At y=5, the walls at x=4 are at 4 steps right and 5 steps down. So if I move up to y=5, I can go right past x=4? Because at x=4, y=5 is a wall, but maybe moving around it. Wait, the walls at x=4 are from y=1 down to y=6. So at x=4, all those positions are walls. So moving right from x=1 to x=4 would hit the wall at x=4, y=6 (same as my current position's y). So I can't go right directly.

Hmm. Maybe I need to move down? But I'm already at y=6 down. Moving down further would take me to y=7, but I'm not sure if there's a path there. Let's check the objects. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 6 steps down, which is where I am. Below that (y=7), is there a wall? The map shows walls at 4 steps right down to 6 steps down, but nothing at y=7. So maybe I can move down to y=7, then go right?

Wait, but how do I get past the walls at x=4? If I can move down past them. Let's visualize:

Current position: (x=-1, y=-6) assuming left is negative x, down is negative y.

Key is at (x=7, y=-5).

Walls at x=4, y from -1 (1 step up) to -6 (6 steps down).

So from my position (-1,-6), moving down to y=-7. Then, moving right towards x=4, but at x=4, y=-7, is there a wall? The walls at x=4 are listed up to y=-6 (6 steps down). So y=-7 would be clear. So path could be:

Move down to y=-7.

Then right to x=4, y=-7 (no wall there).

Then right to x=7, y=-5 (key's position).

But wait, the key is at 7 steps right and 5 steps down. So if down is negative y, 5 steps down is y=-5. So key is at (7, -5).

So moving from (-1,-6) to (7,-5):

First move down to (-1,-7).

Then right to (4,-7) (no wall there).

Then right to (7,-7).

Then up to (7,-5), which is the key.

But then, once I have the key, since the rule is ""key is win"", does touching the key make me win? Or do I need to bring the key to the door?

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", so if I, as Baba, touch the key, I win. Because ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"". So maybe getting to the key is sufficient.

But how to reach the key without hitting walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to rearrange the rules to make walls stop not blocking me, or to make the door a win condition.

But the current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". Wall is stop, so I can't go through walls.

So the straightforward path is to move to the key's location, avoiding walls.

So from Baba's position (1 left, 6 down), which is (-1,-6), need to get to (7,-5).

Possible steps:

1. Move down to (-1,-7).

2. Move right to (4,-7) (no wall here).

3. Move right to (7,-7).

4. Move up to (7,-6).

5. Move up to (7,-5) (key's position).

But wait, at (7,-6), is there a wall? The walls at x=7 are not listed except for the key and win rules. The key is at (7,-5), and the rule blocks are at higher x. So probably no wall there. So this path seems possible.

So the actions would be: down, right, right, right, up, up.

But the game asks for one action per step. So in the current observation, where am I?

Wait, the latest observation shows that the rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So my position is there. So the next move should be to move down first.

In the last observation, after previous actions, the position might have changed. But according to the current observation, the active rules and objects are as listed. So I need to output the next action.

The current position of Baba is at rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 6 steps down. So to move down from there, the action would be ""down"".

But let me check if moving down is possible. Is there a wall below? The walls at x=4 are down to y=6, but my current position is at x=-1, y=-6. Moving down to y=-7, which is beyond the walls at x=4. So no wall there.

So the first step is to move down.

Let me try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the key becomes the target to reach because it's defined as win. Since I'm Baba, and ""baba is you"" makes me controllable.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down from my current position. There are walls to the right and some down paths. The door is at 8 steps right and 5 steps down, but I think the key is the immediate goal.

I need to navigate to the key. Let's check the path. To the right, there's a wall at 4 steps right, but the key is at 7 steps right. So moving right directly might hit a wall. Maybe I need to go down first. Looking at the objects, moving down from my current position (which seems to be at 4 steps right) would take me through steps 3, 2, 1 down. But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step down. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps down. So maybe I can move down four times to reach there. Let me confirm the positions. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. If I move down from my current position (4 right, maybe 0 down?), each down step would reduce the down distance. Wait, the observation mentions the key is 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. So if I'm at the same horizontal level as the key (4 steps right), I need to move down 4 times. But there's a wall at 4 right and 1 down, so I can't go through that. So I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe I can move left past the wall. The wall at 4 right and 1 up is a stop, so I can push it if I'm not stopped. Wait, but the rules say ""wall is stop"", so I can't move through walls. But if I can move the wall by rearranging the rules. For example, if I can make the wall not a stop, then I could move through it. Let me check the current rules: ""wall is stop"" and ""key is win"", ""baba is you"". So the walls are immovable.

So perhaps I need to move around the walls. Let me see. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. My current position might be at 4 right, 0 down (assuming the map starts at some origin). To get to the key, I need to move right three times (to 7 right) and down four times (to 4 down). But moving right three steps from 4 right would take me to 7 right, which is where the key is, but there's a wall at 4 right and 1 up. Wait, maybe my position is different. Let me parse the observation again.

The active rules and objects are listed. The key is at 7 steps to the right and 4 steps down. The door is at 8 right and 5 down. The rule 'baba' is at 1 left and 5 down. So perhaps my current position is somewhere relative to these. Let me visualize the grid.

Assuming that the player (Baba) is at a position, and the key is at (7 right, 4 down). The walls are positioned at various steps. For example, there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up. So if I'm at 4 right, moving up would hit that wall. The key is to the right of that wall. But to get there, I need to move right past the wall, but the wall is at 4 right and 1 up, and the key is at 7 right, 4 down. Maybe the path is blocked vertically. Alternatively, perhaps moving down first.

If I move down from my current position, avoiding the wall at 4 right and 1 down (there's a wall there at 4 right and 1 step down). So moving down from 4 right would take me to 4 right, 1 down (wall), which I can't pass. So maybe I need to move left to get around. If I move left once, to 3 right, then I can move down past the walls? Let's see. The walls at 4 right are up to 5 steps down. If I'm at 3 right, then moving down to 4 steps down (key's position) would be possible if there's no wall there. The key is at 7 right, 4 down, so if I'm at 3 right, 4 down, I need to move right four times, but there's a wall at 4 right, 4 down. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. Since the key is win, and I need to reach it, maybe I can change the rule to make the key a different thing. But how? The current rules are ""key is win"" and ""wall is stop"", and ""baba is you"". If I can move the 'win' rule to another object, like Baba, but I need to push the text blocks. For example, the 'key is win' rule is composed of the rule 'key', 'is', and 'win'. If I can move 'win' to Baba, making 'baba is win', then reaching Baba would win. But how to do that?

The 'key is win' rule is at 7 right, 2 up; 'is' is at 8 right, 2 up; 'win' at 9 right, 2 up. To create 'baba is win', I need to have the rule parts nearby. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left and 4 down, 'is' at 5 down, and 'you' at 2 right and 4 down. Wait, the 'baba' rule is split into 'baba', 'is', and 'you' somewhere else. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the objects: there's 'rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 4 steps down', 'rule `is` 5 steps down', and 'rule `you` 1 step to the right and 4 steps down'. So these are the three parts to make 'baba is you', but currently, 'baba is you' is an active rule. To make 'baba is win', I need to replace 'you' with 'win' in that rule. But how?

I need to move the 'win' text block next to 'baba' and 'is'. The 'win' is currently at 9 right, 2 up. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left, 4 down. That's quite far apart. To move 'win' to the position near 'baba' and 'is', I have to move it left and down multiple steps, pushing other objects out of the way. But I have to ensure that I can move the 'win' block, which might be possible if the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe there's a closer 'win' text block. Wait, the active rule is 'key is win', so the 'win' is part of that rule. To create a new rule 'baba is win', I need to have the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks adjacent. The 'is' is at 8 right, 2 up (part of 'key is win') and also at 5 steps down (part of 'baba is you'). Maybe I can move the 'is' from the 'key is win' to the 'baba' area.

But how to do that? Let's see. The 'is' at 8 right, 2 up is part of the 'key is win' rule. To move it, I need to push it left or down. If I move left, it would go to 7 right, 2 up, which is next to 'key' at 7 right, 2 up. But that would just rearrange the existing rule. Alternatively, moving 'is' down to 5 steps down, where the 'baba' and 'you' rules are. But the 'is' at 5 steps down is already part of the 'baba is you' rule. Maybe I can replace that 'is' with the other 'is'.

Wait, there are two 'is' rules: one at 8 right, 2 up (part of 'key is win') and another at 1 step to the left and 1 step up (part of 'wall is stop')? No, looking back, the active rules are 'key is win', 'wall is stop', and 'baba is you'. The objects list includes multiple 'is' rules, which are the components of those active rules. For example, 'rule `is` 7 steps to the right and 2 step up' is part of 'key is win' (key + is + win), and 'rule `is` 1 step to the left and 1 step up' is part of 'wall is stop' (wall + is + stop).

So to create a new rule 'baba is win', I need to have the 'baba', 'is', and 'win' text blocks adjacent. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left, 4 down. The 'is' rule is at 5 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 9 right, 2 up. That's a long distance. Maybe it's not feasible to move all those blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make the key not the win by moving the 'win' text block. If I can make the rule 'key is stop', then the key becomes a wall. But that's counterproductive. Alternatively, making 'baba is win' would make touching Baba win, but I'm already Baba, so maybe that's a way. But how to do that.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe I can push the key to the door? But the door is at 8 right, 5 down. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. If I can move the key right once and down once, but there's a wall at 4 right and 5 down (the door's position is 8 right, 5 down). Wait, the door is at 8 right, 5 down. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. So moving the key right to 8 right (door's x-coordinate) and down to 5 down would place it at the door. But how to move the key. The key is an object, and since 'key is win', but not 'key is push' or anything. So unless I can make the key movable, I can't push it. The only way to move objects is if they are not 'stop' or have a property that allows movement. Since 'key is win', and 'win' doesn't imply anything about movement, the key is likely immovable unless its rule is changed.

Therefore, perhaps the best approach is to move to the key's location. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's see the path from current position to the key (7 right, 4 down).

Assuming my current position is somewhere. Let's assume I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule, which is 1 step left and 4 steps down. Wait, the 'rule `baba`' is at 1 left and 4 down. But the active rule 'baba is you' is made up of that 'baba' rule, the 'is' at 5 down, and 'you' at 2 right and 4 down. So my position as Baba is probably at the 'baba' rule's location, which is 1 left and 4 down. But that might not be the case. Maybe the player's position is separate from the rule blocks.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to map out the positions.

The key is at 7 right, 4 down. The door is at 8 right, 5 down. The 'baba' rule is at 1 left, 4 down. So if I'm at the 'baba' rule's position (1 left, 4 down), to get to the key (7 right, 4 down), I need to move right 8 times. But there are walls at 4 right, which would block that path. Alternatively, moving down from 4 down to 5 down, but there's a wall at 4 right and 5 down.

Alternatively, maybe my current position is at the 'you' rule, which is at 2 right and 4 down. Then moving left to 1 right, 4 down (baba's position), then up or down. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to move the 'win' text block to create a new rule. For example, take the 'win' at 9 right, 2 up and move it to the 'baba' area. But that would require moving it left 4 steps and down 4 steps, which would push other objects. However, moving the 'win' block might be possible if the path is clear.

Let me see the positions around the 'win' block. The 'win' is at 9 right, 2 up. To the left of it is 'is' at 8 right, 2 up, and 'key' at 7 right, 2 up. So the 'key is win' rule is a horizontal row. To move the 'win' block down, I need to see if there's space. Below the 'key is win' rule, at 9 right, 3 up, there's nothing mentioned. Wait, the objects list includes walls at various positions. For example, wall at 4 steps right and 2 steps down, etc. So maybe there's a path to move the 'win' block down.

If I can push the 'win' block down, perhaps I can create a vertical rule like 'baba is win' by moving 'baba' (1 left, 4 down), 'is' (5 down), and 'win' (9 right, 2 up) into adjacent positions. But that seems too far.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a horizontal rule at the bottom. For example, move 'baba' to the right, 'is' next to it, and 'win' next to that. But the 'baba' rule is at 1 left, 4 down. Moving it right would require pushing through walls. There's a wall at 4 right, 1 step up, but that's above. At 4 down, the walls start at 4 right. So moving 'baba' right from 1 left to, say, 2 right, 4 down might be possible if there's no wall there. Looking at the objects, at 4 right, 4 down there's a wall. So moving right from 1 left, 4 down to 2 right, 4 down would hit the wall at 4 right, 4 down. Wait, noâ€”the wall at 4 right, 4 down is a separate wall. So moving 'baba' right from 1 left to 2 right, 4 down is possible if there's no wall there. The objects list shows a wall at 4 steps right and 4 steps down, but not at 2 right, 4 down. So maybe I can move 'baba' right.

If I can move the 'baba' rule to the right, then place 'is' next to it, and 'win' next to that, forming 'baba is win', then touching Baba (which I am) would make me win. That seems like a viable solution.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'baba' rule (currently at 1 left, 4 down) to the right.
2. Move the 'is' rule (currently at 5 down) to the right next to 'baba'.
3. Move the 'win' rule (currently at 9 right, 2 up) down and to the left to be next to 'is'.

This would require careful movement of the text blocks, avoiding walls.

But how to execute this. Let's think about the first move. To move the 'baba' rule (which is a single text block 'baba') at 1 left, 4 down to the right. To do that, I need to push it right. The space to the right of 1 left, 4 down is 0 left, 4 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, at 4 right, 4 down there's a wall, but that's to the right of 4 right. The position 0 left, 4 down is likely the starting point. Assuming that's empty, I can move 'baba' right once to 0 left (which is the same as 0 steps left, i.e., centered), 4 down.

Once 'baba' is at 0 left, 4 down, the next step is to get the 'is' rule at 5 down to the left to be next to 'baba'. The 'is' is at 5 steps down, so moving it left to 4 down would place it next to 'baba' at 0 left, 4 down. But how? The 'is' is part of the 'baba is you' rule, which is at 5 down. To move it, I need to push it left. The position to the left of 5 down is 4 down. Is there a wall there? At 4 right, 4 down there's a wall, but that's at 4 right, not affecting the left/right movement at 4 down.

So moving the 'is' from 5 down to 4 down (left) would place it next to 'baba' at 0 left, 4 down. Then, the 'win' rule at 9 right, 2 up needs to be moved down to 4 down and left to 1 right, 4 down, next to 'is'.

This requires multiple moves, but perhaps the first step is to move the 'baba' rule right.

But how to do that in the game. Each action is a single step. So to move the 'baba' text block right, I need to be adjacent to it and move in the direction, pushing it if possible.

Assuming I'm at the position of the 'baba' rule (1 left, 4 down), which is the same as (-1, 4) if considering the player's position as origin. To move the 'baba' block right, I need to be next to it. If I'm at the same position as the 'baba' block, then moving right would push it. Wait, but in Baba Is You, you can push text blocks if you are 'push' or if the block isn't 'stop'. Since 'baba is you', and the 'baba' text block is a rule, you can push it unless it's defined as stop. But 'wall is stop',","

39,left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means touching the key makes me win, and I'm Baba. The goal is to get to the key, but the walls are stop, which I can't pass through.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 7 steps right and 4 steps down. There's a door at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. But the door might be locked or require something else. The walls are forming a barrier. Let me map out the positions.

The player (Baba) is probably at the starting point, maybe at the original position not specified here. But based on the objects, the walls are all shifted to the right. The key is further to the right and down. To reach the key, I need to move right and down, but there are walls blocking the path. The walls are 4 steps right and 1 step up, then 4 steps right, and down steps. So maybe moving down from the current position to get past the walls?

Wait, the rule ""wall is stop"" means walls can't be moved through. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can push things if they're not stop. Wait, noâ€”the stop property makes objects immovable. So if something is stop, I can't move it. But I can move other objects if they're not stop. Let me check the objects again.

Looking at the active rules, ""wall is stop"" is still there. So any wall is immovable. The key is at 7 right, 4 down. To get there, maybe I need to move right past the walls. But the walls are at 4 steps right and 1 up, then 4 steps right, and down steps. So from the starting point, if I'm at, say, position (0,0), moving right 4 steps would hit the walls. But the key is further right. Wait, maybe the layout is such that the walls are in a line, and I need to find a way around.

Alternatively, maybe rearranging the rules. Since the key is win, but the rule is ""key is win"", maybe I need to move that rule to make ""baba is win"" instead. But to do that, I need to grab the ""key"" rule and move it next to ""baba"" and ""is"". Let me see where the text blocks are.

The rule ""key"" is at 7 right, 1 up. The ""is"" is at 8 right, 1 up. The ""win"" is at 9 right, 1 up. So they form ""key is win"" across the top. The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left and 5 down, with ""is"" and ""you"" below. If I can move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"", then ""baba is win"" would make me win. That might be a better approach than going for the key directly.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. But first, I have to reach it. The path to the top where the rules are is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and 1 up. So how can I get there? Maybe by pushing walls if they are not stop. Wait, walls are stop, so I can't push them. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe rearrange the rules from the current position.

Alternatively, if I can create a new rule. For example, make ""floor is not stop"" so I can walk through walls, but I don't have a ""floor"" text block. Or maybe ""baba is push"" so I can push walls, but again, not sure.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""wall is stop"" are still present. So the key is win, so touching it would make me win. But the walls are blocking the path. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to make ""baba is win"". Let's try that.

To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. The ""win"" is at 9 steps right and 1 step up. To reach it, I have to move right from my current position. But how far am I? The observation doesn't say where I am, but the objects are positioned relative to somewhere. Let's assume I'm at the position of the player, which isn't listed here. Without knowing my position, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 7 right, 4 down. So if I'm at 4 right, 5 down (the door's position), I need to move left and up. But the door is at 8 right, 4 down. Wait, the door is a separate object. Maybe the door is unlocked because the key is win, so having the key makes the door win. But the key is on the other side of the walls.

Alternatively, maybe moving the ""key is win"" rule to make ""door is win"" instead. But the door is at 8 right, 5 down. Not sure.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Reach the ""win"" rule (at 9 right, 1 up) and move it next to ""baba"" (1 left, 5 down) and ""is"" (5 down) to make ""baba is win"". To do this, I need to move the ""win"" text block from 9 right, 1 up to 1 left, 5 down. That would require moving left and down multiple steps, but there are walls blocking the path.

2. Alternatively, move the ""key"" text block (7 right, 1 up) to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"" at 5 down. But again, path blocked by walls.

3. Another approach: Since the key is win, perhaps just reach the key. To do that, navigate around the walls. The walls are at 4 steps right and varying down positions. From the key's position (7 right,4 down), the path might be clear if I move right and down from my current position. But I need to know where I am.

Assuming I'm at the starting position, maybe at 0,0. To get to the key at 7 right,4 down, I need to move right 7 and down 4. But the walls at 4 right,1 up and others block the way. Maybe go around the walls by moving down first, then right. For example, move down to avoid the walls, then right.

Wait, looking at the walls: they are at 4 right,1 up; 4 right; 4 right,1 down; etc. So from 4 right, the walls go up, same level, down, etc. So if I'm to the left of 4 right, I can move right past them. But the key is at 7 right, which is beyond the walls. So maybe moving right past the walls at 4 right. But how?

If I can move right from my current position (unknown) past the walls at 4 right. Let's say I'm at 3 right, then move right to 4, which is a wall (stop), so I can't. So I need to find a path around. Maybe move down first, then right.

For example, if I'm at 3 right,2 up, move down to 3 right,1 up (which is a wall), no. Alternatively, find a spot where there's no wall. The walls are at 4 right and various down positions. To the left of 4 right, it's clear. So maybe move left to 3 right, then down, then right past the walls.

Alternatively, if I can push a non-stop object to create a path. But the only movable objects would be those not defined as stop. Since walls are stop, and the key is win, which might be movable? The rules don't specify that win is stop, so the key could be moved. So maybe grab the key and move it, but the goal is to touch it anyway.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", so touching the key makes me win. So maybe the intended solution is to move to the key's position. But the path is blocked by walls. How to get around?

Perhaps the walls are only in certain directions. Let me visualize the map:

- Top row (1 step up from 4 right): wall at 4 right,1 up.
- Same level as 4 right: wall at 4 right.
- Below that: walls at 4 right,1 down; 2 steps down; 3 steps down; 4 steps down.
- The key is at 7 right,4 down.
- The door is at 8 right,4 down.
- The ""baba"" rule is at 1 left,5 down, with ""is"" and ""you"" below.

So the layout from the bottom (4 steps down) has walls at 4 right, and the key and door at 7 and 8 right. To get from 4 right to 7 right, need to move right 3 steps, but those positions (5,6,7 right) at 4 down are clear except for the wall at 4 right,4 down. So moving right from 4 right to 5 right,6 right,7 right is possible if those spaces are not blocked.

Wait, the objects listed include walls at 4 right,4 steps down. So at 4 right,4 down is a wall. The key is at 7 right,4 down. So between 4 right and 7 right at 4 down, there's a wall at 4 right,4 down, then open spaces at 5,6,7 right,4 down. So the path from 4 right,4 down to 7 right,4 down is possible by moving right past the wall at 4 right,4 down.

But how do I get to 4 right,4 down? The player's position isn't specified, but assuming they start somewhere, maybe near the ""baba"" rule at 1 left,5 down. To reach 4 right,4 down, need to move right 5 steps and down 1 step. But along the way, are there walls?

From 1 left,5 down (Baba's position), moving right to 4 right would require passing through 0,1,2,3,4 right. At 4 right,5 down, there's a wall. So can't move directly right. Maybe move down first to 1 left,4 down, then right.

At 1 left,4 down: is there a wall? The objects listed are walls at 4 steps right and various positions, but not at 1 left,4 down. So moving down to 1 left,4 down, then right to 4 left,4 down (but that's 3 right?), wait coordinates are confusing.

Alternatively, let's consider coordinates relative to the player. Suppose the player is at position (0,0). Then:

- Wall at 4 right,1 up: (4,1)
- Wall at 4 right: (4,0)
- Wall at 4 right,1 down: (4,-1)
- Etc.
- Key at (7,-4)
- Door at (8,-4)
- Baba's rule at (-1,-5)
- ""is"" at (-1,-5)
- ""you"" at (1,-5)

To reach the key at (7,-4), the player needs to navigate from (0,0) to (7,-4). The path might be:

0,0 â†’ right to 1,0 â†’ right to 2,0 â†’ right to 3,0 â†’ right to 4,0 (wall, can't go) â†’ so instead, move down to 0,-1 â†’ right to 1,-1 â†’ right to 2,-1 â†’ right to 3,-1 â†’ right to 4,-1 (wall at 4,-1?) Check objects: walls at 4 steps right and 1 step down (4,-1), yes. So can't go there.

So alternate path: from 0,0 â†’ down to 0,-1 â†’ right to 1,-1 â†’ down to 1,-2 â†’ right to 2,-2 â†’ down to 2,-3 â†’ right to 3,-3 â†’ down to 3,-4 â†’ right to 4,-4 (wall at 4,-4) â†’ can't. So instead, continue right from 3,-4 to 4,-4 (wall), then right to 5,-4 (is that clear? The key is at 7,-4. At 5,-4, is there a wall? Looking at objects: walls are at 4 steps right and various positions, but 5,-4 is not listed as a wall. So 5,-4 is clear. So move right from 4,-4 (can't) â†’ maybe move up or down.

This is getting too complicated without knowing the exact map layout. Maybe the intended solution is to rearrange the rules to make ""baba is win"" instead of ""key is win"". To do that, need to move the ""win"" text block from 9 right,1 up to be next to ""baba"" at -1,-5 and ""is"" at -1,-5.

To move the ""win"" block, the player would need to go to 9 right,1 up, grab it, and carry it down to -1,-5. But the path there is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the text blocks without traversing the entire map.

Alternatively, since the key is win, and the key is at 7 right,4 down, maybe the solution is to move down to that position and pick up the key. But how to get there.

Another angle: the door is at 8 right,4 down. The door might be the win condition if the key is obtained, but the active rule says key is win. So perhaps touching the key makes you win, regardless of the door.

Given the multiple failed attempts, maybe the correct action is to move right towards the key, but navigating around the walls by moving down first. For example, move down to avoid the wall at 4 right, then right.

But without knowing the player's exact position, it's hard to say. The latest observation shows the player is probably at 4 right,5 down (near the door), and needs to move left or down.

Alternatively, the correct action is to move down from the current position to reach the key's level. Looking at the last observation, the active rules are the same, and the objects are positioned with the key at 7 right,4 down. If the player is at 4 right,5 down (door's position), moving down to 4 right,4 down would hit a wall. So instead, move left to 3 right,5 down, then down to 3 right,4 down (which is clear), then right to 7 right,4 down.

But how to execute that in actions. The possible actions are up, down, left, right, idle.

Assuming the player is at 4 right,5 down (door's position), the sequence would be:

1. Down to 4 right,4 down (wall, can't)
2. Left to 3 right,5 down
3. Down to 3 right,4 down
4. Right to 4 right,4 down (wall)
5. Right to 5 right,4 down
6. Right to 6 right,4 down
7. Right to 7 right,4 down (key)

So actions: left, down, right, right, right, right.

But the system might require a single action per step. So the first action should be left to get to 3 right,5 down.

In the latest observation, the player is at a position where the active rules are the same, and the objects are as listed. The previous actions were left, right, up, down, etc., but kept failing. Maybe the correct action now is to move down from the current position to reach the key's level.

Looking at the last observation, the player is likely at 4 right,5 down (door's position). Moving down would take them to 4 right,4 down, which is a wall. So instead, move left to 3 right,5 down, then down to 3 right,4 down (clear), then right towards the key.

So the first action should be left.

40,down,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to figure out how to get past the walls and reach the door. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal is to get to the key because it's defined as win. But the door is also there. Maybe the key is acting as the win condition, so grabbing it would let me win? Or maybe the door is the actual win, but the rules say key is win. I need to check the objects on the map.

Looking at the objects: there's a key at 8 steps right and 1 step up. Then, down at 4 steps down, there's another key at 8 steps right and 4 steps down. The door is at 9 steps right and 5 steps down. The walls are all aligned to the right, so moving right might be blocked by walls unless I can change the rules.

Since ""baba is you"", I can move like Baba. The problem is the walls are ""stop"", so I can't go through them. The key is win, so maybe picking up the key makes me win? But how do I reach it?

The key at 8 right, 1 up is next to a rule 'key', 'is', 'win'. If I can move those text blocks to make a new rule, like 'baba is win' or 'door is you', that might help. But first, I need to get to where the text blocks are.

Wait, the current position of the player (Baba) isn't specified here. The observation shows the rules and objects but not where Baba is. Without knowing Baba's location, it's hard to plan. But maybe the initial position is implied. Let's assume Baba is near the lower part because the key and door are down there.

Looking at the objects: the rule `baba` is at 5 steps down. So maybe Baba is at that position. The rule 'baba' is there, so if I can pick up that 'baba' text block and combine it with 'is' and 'you' to make 'baba is you', but that's already the active rule. Hmm.

The key at 8 right, 4 down is probably closer. To get there, I need to move right and down. But the walls are at 5 steps right and various downs. So moving from 5 steps right to 8 steps right would require moving right 3 times, but there are walls at 5 right, 4 right, etc. Wait, the walls are at 5 right, 4 right, 3 down, etc. So moving right from 5 right would hit a wall at 5 right's position? Wait, the walls are listed as:

wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up
wall 5 steps to the right
wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step down
wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down
... down to 5 steps to the right and 5 steps down.

So the path to the key at 8 right, 4 down is blocked by walls at 5 right. Unless I can push the walls, but they are 'stop', so I can't move them. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing, but I don't see any.

Alternative approach: change the rules. The key is win, so if I can make 'key' be 'you' or 'door' be 'win', that might help. The text blocks for 'key', 'is', 'win' are at 8 right, 1 up. If I can move those to create a new rule like 'door is win', then going to the door would win.

But to move the text blocks, I need to be adjacent to them and not be stopped. The 'key' rule is at 8 right, 1 up. To get there, I need to move from Baba's position, which is at the rule `baba` at 5 steps down. Let's see:

Baba's position is at the rule `baba` which is 1 step to the left and 4 steps down (from previous observations?), but in the current observation, the rule `baba` is at 5 steps down. So maybe Baba is at that position. So position: 5 steps down, and to get to the 'key' rule at 8 right, 1 up, I need to move right and up. But the path is blocked by walls at 5 steps right. Unless there's a way around.

Wait, the current active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. So as Baba, I can move unless blocked by 'stop'. The walls are 'stop', so I can't go through them. So moving right from 5 steps right would hit a wall at 5 right. Unless I can move the wall rules. For example, if I can change 'wall is stop' to something else, then the walls wouldn't block me. But where is the 'wall is stop' rule? Looking at the objects, there's a rule `wall` at 1 step up, and another rule `wall` at 1 step to the left and 1 step up in previous observations. But in the current observation, the rules are:

rule `wall` 1 step up
rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `is` 9 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 1 step up
rule `is` 2 steps to the right
rule `stop` 3 steps to the right

So the 'wall is stop' rule is not explicitly present here. Wait, maybe it was broken before. Previously, there was 'wall is stop', but now it's split into rule `wall` and rule `stop` separate. So the current active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. There's no 'wall is stop', so walls might not be 'stop' anymore? Wait, no. The active rules are only the ones that are formed by the text blocks. If the text blocks for 'wall' and 'stop' are separate, then the rule 'wall is stop' is not active. So now, walls might be movable unless there's another rule making them stop.

But in the current observation, the active rules are only 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. So walls are not defined as stop anymore. That's a game-changer! So I can move past the walls because they are no longer 'stop'. That means I can navigate around them.

So the plan is: since walls are not stop anymore, I can move right past them to reach the key or the door. Let's check the positions again.

Baba's position is at the rule `baba` which is at 5 steps down. Looking at the objects, the rule `baba` is at 5 steps down. So Baba is likely at that position: 5 steps down. To get to the key at 8 steps right and 4 steps down, I need to move right and down. Let's see the path:

From 5 steps down, moving down to 4 steps down, then right to 8 steps right. But between 5 steps right and 8 steps right, there are walls at 5 steps right, but since walls are not stop anymore, I can push them? Or just walk past?

Wait, the objects list walls at various positions, but if they're not 'stop', then they're movable. So I can move past them. So the path from Baba's position (5 steps down) to the key at 8 rights,4 downs would be:

Move down to 4 steps down (there's a wall there, but it's not stop, so I can move through), then right to 8 steps right, passing through the walls at 5,4,3 rights. But the walls are objects on the map, but if they're not stop, can I move over them?

In Baba Is You, normally, you can move over objects that are not stop. So yes. So the steps would be:

1. From 5 steps down, move down to 4 steps down ( there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 steps down, but since it's not stop, moving down past it is possible).

2. Then move right 3 times to reach 8 steps right (passing through walls at 5,4,3 rights, but they're not stop, so allowed).

3. Once at 8 steps right,4 steps down, there's the key. Since key is win, picking it up would make me win. But how do I pick it up? In the game, you have to touch the object. So moving to the same position as the key.

So the actions needed would be: down, down, right, right, right, right, etc., but need to check the exact positions.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at 9 steps right and 5 steps down. If I can reach the door, which is the win condition, but the active rule says key is win. However, if the key is already win, maybe touching it is sufficient. But perhaps the door is the actual exit. Need to check.

But the key is defined as win, so touching it should make me win. So the plan is to move to the key at 8 rights,4 downs.

So the sequence of moves would be:

From Baba's position (5 steps down):

First, move down to 4 steps down (passing the wall there).

Then move right to 8 steps right,4 steps down. But need to check if there are walls in between. The walls are at 5 steps right at various downs, but since they're not stop, moving right past them is possible.

So the actions would be:

down (to 4 steps down)

right (to 6 steps right,4 steps down)

right (7)

right (8)

Then, at 8 steps right,4 steps down, there's the key. So move right once more? Wait, the key's position is 8 steps right and 3 steps down? No, looking back: in the current observation, key is at 8 steps right and 4 steps down.

So from 5 steps down:

Move down once to 4 steps down.

Then move right three times (from 5 to 8 steps right).

So actions: down, right, right, right.

Once at 8,4, which has the key, that should trigger the win because key is win.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 8,1 up. But that's higher up, blocked by walls before. But since walls are not stop, maybe possible. But the key at 8,4 down is closer.

So the chosen action is to move down first to get into position.

41,down,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do next. The active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key, which is acting as the win condition, right?

Looking at the objects on the map, I see the key is at 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down. There's also a door at 9 steps right and 4 steps down. But the key is the win object now, so I need to reach it. 

The walls are all labeled as ""stop"", so I can't move through them. My current position isn't shown, but based on the previous observations, maybe I'm near the key? Let me check the positions again. 

The rule `baba` is at 4 steps down. If I'm assuming I'm controlling Baba, that's likely my position. To reach the key at 8 right, 3 down, I need to move right and down. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 steps down. Wait, the path from Baba's position (4 down) to the key (3 down) would require moving down once, but maybe there are obstacles. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 5 steps right and 1 step up, then continuing down. The key is at 8 right, 3 down. So from Baba at 4 down, moving right three times and down once? But between there and the key, are there walls? The walls are at 5 right steps, so maybe the path is blocked? Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right and various down positions, but the key is at 8 right, which is further to the right. So maybe I can move right past the walls? But the walls are at 5 right, so if I'm at 4 down, moving right to 5, then maybe the wall is there. But the rule says ""wall is stop"", so I can't pass through walls. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules. Since ""key is win"" is active, maybe I need to get the key to Baba. But how? If I can move the key to Baba's position, but the key is an object. Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects if they're not stopped. But the key here is the win object. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rules to make ""baba is win"" instead, so that reaching Baba himself would win. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to Baba. Let's see where the text blocks are. The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 2 up. The ""is"" is next to it. So if I can move the ""win"" text next to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would make me the win condition. But how to get there? The path might be blocked by walls. 

Alternatively, the key is the win object, so I just need to reach it. The key is at 8 right, 3 down. From my current position (assuming I'm at the rule `baba` at 4 down), I need to move right three times and down once. But between 4 down and 3 down, there's a wall at 5 right and 4 down. Wait, noâ€”the walls are at 5 right and various positions. Let me check the walls again. 

The walls are at:
- 5 right, 2 up
- 5 right, 1 up
- 5 right
- 5 right, 1 down
- 5 right, 2 down
- 5 right, 3 down
- 5 right, 4 down

So the path from my position (4 down) to the key (3 down) is down to 3 down, which is clear? Wait, at 5 right, 4 down there's a wall, but the key is at 8 right, 3 down. So moving down from 4 to 3 down would be possible if there's no wall in between. But the walls are all at 5 right steps. So moving down from 4 down to 3 down, but my current x-coordinate isn't clear. If I'm at 4 down and, say, 4 right (based on the rule `baba` being at 1 step left and 5 steps down earlier?), maybe I need to adjust. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to move towards the key. If I can move right towards 8 right, but there's a wall at 5 right. So perhaps I need to move around the walls. Alternatively, use the text blocks to change rules. 

The ""win"" rule is at 10 right, 2 up. If I can move that to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would make me win. But how to get there? The path from the current position to 10 right, 2 up is blocked by walls at 5 right. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" to make a new rule. 

Alternatively, the key is at 8 right, 3 down. If I can get there, then since key is win, touching it would win. So moving right from my current position (assuming I'm at the baba rule at 4 steps down) towards 8 right. But the walls are at 5 right, so maybe I need to move past them. Wait, the walls are at 5 right, but the key is at 8 right, which is further right. So maybe there's a path to the right beyond 5 right. Let me check the map again. 

Looking at the objects, after 5 right, there are walls at 5 right and various down positions, but the key is at 8 right, 3 down. So from 5 right, moving right three more steps to 8 right, avoiding any walls. But between 5 and 8 right, are there walls? The observations mention walls at 5 right steps, but not beyond. So maybe the path is clear. 

So the plan is: move right from current position (assuming I'm at 4 steps down, maybe at 4 right) to 8 right, 3 down. But how to navigate? Let's see. If I'm at the rule `baba` which is 1 step left and 5 steps down earlier, but current observation shows rule `baba` at 4 steps down. Hmm, maybe I'm at 4 steps down. To get to the key at 8 right, 3 down, I need to move right 4 times and down once. But the walls are at 5 right, so moving right past 5 right might be possible if there are no walls there. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key"" text block next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is key"", but that doesn't help since the active rule is ""key is win"". 

Alternatively, since ""key is win"", just reaching the key would win. So the priority is to get to the key's position. Let's focus on that. 

From the current observation, the key is at 8 steps right and 3 steps down. My position is likely near the rule `baba` which is at 4 steps down. So moving down once to 3 steps down, then right four times to 8 steps right. But need to check if the path is clear. 

Looking at the walls: the walls are at 5 steps right and various down positions, but the path from 4 steps down to 3 steps down at 8 right should be clear if there's no wall there. The wall at 5 right, 3 steps down is present, but if I'm moving right past 5 to 8, that's okay as long as there's no wall in between. Since the walls are only at 5 right, the path from 5 right to 8 right should be clear. 

So the steps would be: move down to 3 steps down, then move right four times. But how is that possible given the previous actions? Maybe I need to adjust. 

Alternatively, maybe I should move down first, then right. Let's see. Current position: assuming I'm at the rule `baba` at 4 steps down. Move down to 3 steps down (key's y-coordinate), then move right to 8 steps right. 

But how to confirm my current position? The rule `baba` is at 4 steps down. So if I'm controlling Baba, my position is at 4 steps down, and the rule `baba` is a text block next to me? Or is the rule `baba` separate? 

In Baba Is You, when you have ""baba is you"", Baba becomes the movable character. The text blocks are separate objects. So the rule `baba` at 4 steps down is a text block, and the actual Baba character is probably at a different position. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to move towards the key. Let's assume I can move right and down. So the action would be to move down first to reach the key's y-coordinate, then right. 

Looking at the previous actions, the assistant kept moving left, right, up, etc., but sometimes failed. Maybe the correct path is to move down to 3 steps down, then right to 8 steps right. But how to do that step by step. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 8 right, 3 down, and the door is at 9 right, 5 down, maybe the key is behind some walls. But the walls are at 5 right, so beyond that, there's a clear path. 

Another approach: since ""key is win"", perhaps I don't need to move the key, but just touch it. So if I can reach the key's position, touching it would win. So the goal is to navigate to 8 right, 3 down. 

To do that, from my current position (assuming near the rule `baba` at 4 down), move down once to 3 down, then right four times to 8 right. But need to check for walls. 

The walls at 5 right prevent moving left past them, but moving right from 5 right is allowed. So if I'm at 4 down and, say, 4 right, moving right to 5, 6, 7, 8 right should be possible. 

Therefore, the actions needed are: down, right, right, right, right. But since each action is a single step, I need to choose the next immediate action. 

Given the current observation, the key is at 8 right, 3 down. My current position is likely at 4 steps down (where the rule `baba` is), so moving down once would align me with the key's y-coordinate. Then move right multiple times. 

But the problem is determining the exact current position of the agent (Baba). Since the rule `baba` is at 4 steps down, but Baba's position might be adjacent to that text block. For example, if the rule `baba` is to the left of Baba, then Baba would be 1 step to the right of the rule `baba`. 

Assuming that, if the rule `baba` is at 4 steps down, then Baba is either at 4 steps down and 1 step right (if the text block is to the left) or another position. This is tricky without exact coordinates. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent's position is inferred from the objects. The key is at 8 right, 3 down. The door is at 9 right, 5 down. The walls are at 5 right. So the path from key to door is through open space. 

Given the previous actions where the assistant kept moving left and right but failed, maybe the correct path is to move down towards the key's y-coordinate. 

In the last observation, the active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The key is at 8 right, 3 down. So the next step is to move down to reach that row, then right. 

Therefore, the chosen action should be down to align vertically with the key, then proceed right. Since the previous attempt to move down was followed by a failure (maybe because of a wall?), but in the current observation, there's no wall at 4 steps down, 3 down (the key's y-coordinate). 

Looking at the walls: the walls at 5 right, 3 steps down. So if I'm at 4 steps down, moving down to 3 would be possible if there's no wall there. The walls are only at 5 right, so moving down from 4 to 3 should be free. 

Therefore, the action should be down to reach the key's row, then right. So the immediate action is down.

Let's tackle this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the door or whatever's defined as ""WIN"". Looking at the active rules, ""key is win"" means touching the key would make me win. ""Baba is you"" means I can move as Baba.

Now, the map layout. From the current observation, there's a key located at 8 steps right and 2 steps down. The door is at 9 steps right and 3 steps down. But there are walls (marked as stop) blocking the path. The key is two steps down from my current position, but there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. Wait, how do I get past that?

I need to figure out how to move the walls or rules. Since ""wall is stop"" isn't active anymore, maybe I can change that. Let me check the objects. There are rules scattered around. For example, there's a ""rule `wall` 3 step up"" and ""rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 2 step up"". If I can move these rules, maybe I can redefine ""wall"" or ""stop"" to something else.

The key is at 8 right, 2 down. To get there, I need to go down twice. But the wall at 5 right and 2 down is a problem. If I can turn that wall into something movable, maybe I can push it out of the way. But how?

Looking at the rules, there's a ""rule `is`"" block. If I can rearrange the ""wall is stop"" rule, maybe I can make ""wall"" not stop. For example, if I move ""wall"" to ""stop is wall"", that could reverse the property. But I need to see where the existing rules are.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 step up and 3 steps right and 2 step up. If I can grab that ""wall"" text block and move it to another part, perhaps making ""stop is wall"" or ""wall is you"", that might help. But I have to make sure I can move the text blocks. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", and the text blocks aren't marked as stop anymore (earlier rules?), maybe they're movable.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""wall is stop"" might have been altered. Wait, noâ€” looking back, the initial problem had ""wall is stop"" as an active rule, but in the current observation, maybe that's been changed. Let me check again.

Current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So ""wall is stop"" isn't active now. That means walls aren't stopping me. Wait, but in the objects list, there are walls listed, but since ""wall is stop"" isn't a current rule, maybe they're just regular walls that I can push or move past?

Wait, no. In Baba Is You, if a rule like ""wall is stop"" exists, then walls are immovable. If that rule is removed or changed, walls might become movable. But in the current observation, the active rules don't include ""wall is stop"", so walls might be pushable or passable. Let me confirm.

Looking at the current active rules: only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So walls are not defined as stop. That means I can maybe walk through them or push them if they're pushable. Wait, but in the objects list, there are walls at various positions. If ""wall is stop"" isn't active, then those walls don't block movement. So maybe I can just walk around them.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says ""Remember that you can only move objects or text that are not defined as 'STOP' or similar immovable properties."" So if ""wall is stop"" is not active, then walls are movable. But how? Do I need to push them?

Alternatively, maybe the walls are just decorative since their stop property isn't active. Let me think. If I can move past the walls because they're not stopping me, then the path to the key is blocked only by their positions. The key is at 8 right, 2 down. From my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe 5 right?), I need to move down to reach the key.

But in the objects, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. If walls are not stopping me, I can walk through them. So maybe I can go down twice, pass through the wall at 5 right, 2 down, and reach the key at 8 right, 2 down. But how do I get from 5 right to 8 right? There's a gap. Maybe I need to move right after getting past the walls.

Alternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the rules to make ""key is win"" more accessible. For example, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position so that the key becomes the win object, but that's already the case.

Wait, the key is already defined as win. So touching the key should make me win. So the plan is to reach the key. The problem is navigating to it.

Looking at the map:

- The key is at 8 right, 2 down.
- There's a wall at 5 right, 2 down.
- But if walls are not stop, then I can walk around them. Let's see the positions.

Assuming my current position is 5 steps right (since the walls are at 5 right and various down steps), to get to the key at 8 right, 2 down, I need to move right three times and down two times. But there's a wall at 5 right, 2 down. If I move down two steps, I'd be at 5 right, 2 down (the wall), but since walls don't stop me, I can move through it. Then move right to 8 right, 2 down (the key).

But wait, the path from 5 right, 0 down (assuming starting there) to 8 right, 2 down would require moving right 3 times and down 2 times. But the wall is at 5 right, 2 down. So moving down two steps from 5 right would land me on the wall, which I can then move past. Then right to 8.

But maybe the exact path is: start at 5 right, move down to 5 right, 1 down (no wall there?), then down to 5 right, 2 down (wall), then right to 8 right, 2 down (key). So that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way by moving rules. For example, if I can change ""wall is stop"" back to being a rule, but that would make walls stop again. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can make ""baba is win"", then I would win just by existing. But to do that, I need to move the ""baba"" text block with ""is"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"". Let's see where those are.

Looking at the objects:

- rule `baba` is at 5 steps down.
- rule `is` is at 1 step right and 5 steps down.
- rule `you` is at 2 steps right and 5 steps down.

So to make ""baba is win"", I need to take the `baba` rule at 5 steps down, move it left to meet the `is` at 1 step right and 5 steps down, then add `win` which is at 10 steps right and 3 steps up. That seems complicated. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, focus on reaching the key. Let's outline the steps:

1. From current position (assuming at 5 right, 0 down), move down to 5 right, 1 down.
2. Move down again to 5 right, 2 down (passing through the wall).
3. Move right three times to 8 right, 2 down (key's position).
4. Touch the key to win.

But need to confirm if the path is clear. The walls are at 5 right and 1 step up, 2 step up, 1 down, 2 down, 3 down, etc. So moving down from 5 right would hit walls at 2 step down (5 right, 2 down) but since walls don't stop, it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's a wall blocking the right movement after getting to the key's position. The key is at 8 right, 2 down. The next position to the right is 9 right, 2 down, which is a door. So that's the win condition.

But to get to the key, need to navigate through the grid. Let's consider the exact positions.

Current map details:

- rule `wall` at 3 step up.
- wall at 5 right, 3 step up.
- rule `key` at 8 right, 3 step up.
- etc.

Wait, the current observation shows the key at 8 steps right and 3 step up? No, in the last observation, the key is at 8 steps right and 3 step down. Let me check the latest observation:

In the current observation provided:

Objects on the map include:

key 8 steps to the right and 3 steps down

door 9 steps to the right and 3 steps down

So the key is at 8 right, 3 down. The door is at 9 right, 3 down.

So the path from 5 right (current position) to 8 right, 3 down would require moving right 3 times and down 3 times. But there are walls along the way.

Looking at the walls:

- wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down
- wall 5 steps to the right and 4 steps down
- etc.

So moving down from 5 right:

- 5 right, 1 down: no wall mentioned, so maybe path is clear.
- 5 right, 2 down: wall.
- 5 right, 3 down: wall.
- 5 right, 4 down: wall.
- 5 right, 5 down: wall.

But if walls are not stop, then I can move through them. So from 5 right, 0 down:

Move down to 5,1 down (pass through any wall there? If no wall, then okay).

Then down to 5,2 down (wall, pass through).

Then right to 6,2 down.

Right to 7,2 down.

Right to 8,2 down (key).

Then down to 8,3 down (door).

But wait, the key is at 8 right, 3 down. So after getting the key, need to move down once more to reach the door.

But does touching the key make me win? The active rule is ""key is win"", so yes. So moving to the key's position (8 right, 3 down) should make me win.

But how to navigate there without getting stuck.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way by manipulating rules. For example, if I can create a rule that allows me to move over walls.

But given the current active rules, ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", and the objects available, the straightforward approach is to move to the key.

So the sequence would be:

1. Move down from current position (assuming starting at 5 right, 0 down) to 5,1 down.

2. Move down to 5,2 down (pass through wall).

3. Move right to 6,2 down.

4. Move right to 7,2 down.

5. Move right to 8,2 down (key).

6. Move down to 8,3 down (door), but since key is win, touching the key at 8,2 down should win the game.

Therefore, the correct action is to move right multiple times and down.

But the problem is selecting the exact action step by step. The previous attempts had the model trying left, right, up, down, but maybe the correct path is a combination.

However, in the current observation, the exact positions might require specific moves. Let me check the exact positions again.

In the current observation:

- Active rules: key is win, baba is you.

- Objects:

  - rule `wall` 3 step up

  - wall 5 steps to the right and 3 step up

  - rule `key` 8 steps to the right and 3 step up

  - rule `is` 9 steps to the right and 3 step up

  - rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 3 step up

  - rule `is` 2 steps to the right and 2 step up

  - rule `stop` 3 steps to the right and 2 step up

  - wall 5 steps to the right and 2 step up

  - wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step up

  - wall 5 steps to the right

  - wall 5 steps to the right and 1 step down

  - wall 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down

  - key 8 steps to the right and 2 steps down

  - rule `baba` 3 steps down

  - rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 steps down

  - rule `you` 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down

  - wall 5 steps to the right and 3 steps down

  - door 9 steps to the right and 3 steps down

Assuming the player's position is at 5 right, 0 down (since walls are at 5 right and various steps down/up), the key is at 8 right, 2 down. To get there:

1. Move down to 5,1 down.

2. Move down to 5,2 down (pass through wall).

3. Move right to 6,2 down.

4. Move right to 7,2 down.

5. Move right to 8,2 down (key).

6. Since key is win, touching it would win.

But perhaps the immediate next step is to move right from the current position (assuming the current position is 5 right, 0 down). Wait, noâ€” the current position isn't explicitly stated, but based on the objects, the player (Baba) is likely at a position among the walls and rules. Alternatively, the player's position is where the ""baba"" rule is, but in the objects list, there's a ""rule `baba` 3 steps down"". So maybe the player is at that position: 3 steps down.

Wait, this is getting confusing. In Baba Is You, the player's position is typically where the ""BABA"" text block is, but in this case, the objects include a ""rule `baba` 3 steps down"". So the actual Baba figure is probably at that rule's position: 3 steps down.

So the player is at 3 steps down. To reach the key at 8 right, 2 down, need to move right and down.

From 3 steps down:

- Move right to 4 steps down.

But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 3 steps down. Wait, noâ€” the walls are at 5 steps to the right and various down positions. The player's current position is at the ""rule `baba` 3 steps down"", which is likely at a specific coordinate. This part is a bit unclear without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the player's position is inferred from the objects. If the ""rule `baba`"" is at 3 steps down, then the player is at that location. So to move towards the key at 8 right, 2 down, the player needs to move right and down.

But without knowing the exact grid layout, it's challenging. However, given the previous actions and the pattern, the correct sequence is likely moving right and down towards the key.

Given the previous failed attempts and the need to provide a valid action, the most logical next step is to move down towards the key's location.

I need to figure out how to get to the door in this Baba Is You level. Let me start by understanding the current situation based on the observation provided.

The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, grabbing the key would make it the win condition, but here it's already set that the key is the win. However, the player (Baba) is also the ""you"" object, meaning I can move Baba around by pushing other objects if possible, unless they're stopped by walls or other STOP properties.

Looking at the objects on the map:

- There's a wall at 4 steps up, 5 steps to the right and 4 steps up. Then the key is at 8 steps right and 4 steps up, followed by ""is"", ""win"" rules. Below that, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, and so on down to the door at 9 steps right and 2 steps down.

Baba's current position seems to be at 2 steps down, with ""rule baba"" there. So I'm nearby the lower part. The door is two steps to the right and two steps down from where I am. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 2 steps down, which is a STOP. So I need to get around that.

Let me visualize the layout. From the rules and walls, it looks like there's a vertical line of walls starting from 4 steps up at 5 right, decreasing each step down until 5 steps right and 2 steps up, then a wall at 2 steps down. The key is high up at 4 steps up, but maybe I don't need it since the key is already the win. Wait, the key is the win, so probably the goal is to reach the key, but the door is the exit. Wait, the active rules say ""key is win"", so maybe touching the key makes you win? Or does ""win"" refer to the door? Wait, in the objects, there's a door at 9 right and 2 down. But the rule says ""key is win"", so touching the key would win. But in the current observation, the key is at 8 right and 4 up, which is blocked by the wall at 4 steps up. So how do I get there?

Alternatively, maybe the door is the actual win condition, but the rule was changed. Wait, the initial active rules were ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So to win, I need to touch the key. But the key is behind a wall. So how do I push the wall? The walls are STOP, so unless I can change their property. Since ""wall is stop"" was part of the initial rules, but in the current observation, the active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So maybe I can move the ""wall is stop"" rule to change the wall's property.

Looking at the objects, there are rule blocks for ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc. For example, there's a rule ""wall"" 1 step up, then ""is"" and ""stop"" nearby. Maybe I can rearrange these rules to make the wall not a stop. For instance, if I can create a rule like ""wall is not stop"", then I could push the walls. Alternatively, change ""baba is you"" to ""baba is push"" so I can push objects.

But how to do that? The agent needs to move the text blocks. Let's see the positions of the rule blocks. For example, there's a rule ""wall"" 1 step to the left and 1 step up, followed by ""is"" and ""stop"" rules. If I can move these to form a new rule, like ""stop is you"", then maybe walls can be moved. But the agent has to navigate to those rule blocks and rearrange them.

Alternatively, the current position of the agent (Baba) is at 2 steps down with the ""rule baba"" block. Maybe moving that to create a new rule. For example, if I move ""baba is you"" to make ""baba is push"", then I can push walls. But the problem is that the agent needs to be adjacent to the text blocks to move them, and they can only be moved if they are not STOP or similar.

Looking at the current setup, the walls are STOP, so the agent (Baba) can't push them unless the STOP property is removed. So the key is to either remove the STOP property from walls or change Baba's property to allow pushing.

Let me check the available rule blocks. There's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. If I can move that rule away or replace it, maybe I can make walls movable. For example, if I create a rule ""stop is lose"" or something, but that might not help. Alternatively, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"" by moving the ""stop"" rule to another part.

But the agent is at 2 steps down, with ""rule baba"" there. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps to the right and 3 steps up, maybe? Wait, the observation lists the objects as:

- rule `wall` 4 step up
- wall 5 steps right and 4 step up
- rule `key` 8 steps right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 9 steps right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 10 steps right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 2 steps right and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 3 steps right and 3 step up
- walls descending down to 5 steps right and 2 steps down
- key at 8 right, 1 step down
- rule `baba` at 2 steps down
- etc.

So the ""stop"" rule is at 3 steps right and 3 steps up. To get there, the agent would need to move up, but there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 5 steps right and 3 steps up is a wall. So maybe the agent can't reach the ""stop"" rule directly because it's blocked by walls.

Alternative approach: Since the key is the win condition, maybe the way to win is to reach the key, but it's blocked by walls. So perhaps the solution is to rearrange the rules to make the walls passable. For example, change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is you"", which would allow Baba to step on walls. But how to do that?

The agent needs to move the relevant text blocks. Let's see the current rule blocks:

- At 4 steps up: rule `wall`, rule `key`, rule `is`, rule `win`
- At 3 steps up: rule `is`, rule `stop`
- Further down, the walls are placed.

If the agent can move the ""stop"" rule and the ""wall"" rule, perhaps to form a new rule like ""wall is not stop"". For example, if the agent can take the ""wall"" rule and the ""stop"" rule and place them next to each other as ""wall is not stop"", that would make walls passable.

But the agent is currently at 2 steps down with the ""rule baba"" block. To reach the upper rules, there's a path blocked by walls. For example, from the agent's position at 2 steps down, to get to the upper rules at 4 steps up, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 3 steps up, 2 steps up, etc. So unless the agent can move those walls by changing their rules, they can't get past.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can push the key down to the door area. Since the key is at 8 right and 4 up, and the door is at 9 right and 2 down. If the agent can push the key down, but the key is a WIN object. In Baba Is You, some objects when moved might change their behavior. But I'm not sure if moving the key affects the win condition.

Alternatively, since the key is the win, maybe just touching it anywhere wins. But it's blocked by walls. So the only way is to remove the walls' STOP property.

Another angle: The agent is Baba, and ""baba is you"" means the agent can push other objects if possible. But the walls are STOP, so they can't be pushed. Unless the STOP rule is changed.

Wait, the agent is at 2 steps down, with the ""rule baba"" block. If the agent can move that rule to create a new rule, like ""baba is push"", then maybe the agent can push walls. But how?

Let me think step by step. The agent's current position is near the lower part, with the door at 9 right and 2 down. The door is behind a wall at 5 right and 2 down. So to reach the door, need to move that wall. But the wall is STOP, so can't be pushed. So need to change the wall's property.

To change ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"". The agent needs to access the ""stop"" rule and the ""wall"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right and 3 up. The ""wall"" rule is at 4 right and 4 up. The agent is at 2 down, so the path to those upper rules is blocked by walls.

Alternative idea: Maybe there's a way to use the key to unlock something. But the key is the win condition, so grabbing it would win. But it's behind walls. Unless the agent can move the walls by rewriting the rules.

Alternatively, the agent can create a new rule that makes walls passable. For example, ""wall is you"" or ""wall is win"". But to do that, the agent needs to move the ""wall"" and ""is"" and ""you"" or other relevant rules.

Looking at the current rules, there's a ""you"" rule at 2 steps right and 5 steps down. The agent is at 2 steps down, so maybe nearby. If the agent can move the ""wall"" rule (at 4 up) and the ""you"" rule to make ""wall is you"", then walls become passable.

But the agent is at 2 steps down, which is far from the upper rules. The distance is significant. Each move is one step in a direction. So from the agent's position at 2 down, to get to the ""wall"" rule at 4 up, the agent needs to move up four times, but there are walls in the way. For example, at 5 right and 3 up is a wall, which is STOP. So the agent can't move through walls.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's another approach. The door is at 9 right and 2 down. The agent is at 2 steps down, so maybe moving right towards the door. But there's a wall at 5 right and 2 down (STOP), so can't go through. If the agent could move that wall, maybe by changing its rule.

Alternatively, the agent can use the key to create a new rule. The key is at 8 right and 4 up. If the agent can reach the key, grab it, and then use it to form a new rule. But again, the path is blocked by walls.

Wait, maybe the agent doesn't need the key since the rule is ""key is win"", but perhaps the actual win is the door. Wait, no, the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key should win. But the key is inaccessible.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me think again. The agent is Baba, with the ""baba is you"" rule. The key is the win condition. The door is present but perhaps not the win condition anymore. Wait, no, the active rules are still ""key is win"", so the door might not be relevant unless the rules have changed.

Another possibility: The agent can push the key down to the door area. If the key is moved to the door, maybe that triggers the win. But the key is at 8 right and 4 up, and the door is at 9 right and 2 down. The path between them is blocked by walls. Unless the agent can move the walls out of the way by changing their rules.

Alternatively, the agent can create a rule that makes the door the win condition instead of the key. For example, change ""key is win"" to ""door is win"". But to do that, the agent needs to move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" rules to form a new rule. However, the ""key is win"" rule is at 4 up, and the agent is at 2 down, so it's a long way.

Wait, maybe the agent can rearrange the rules in the lower part. For example, there's a ""rule baba"" at 2 steps down, ""rule is"" at 1 right and 5 down, and ""rule you"" at 2 right and 5 down. If the agent can combine these to create a new rule. For instance, if the agent moves ""baba"", ""is"", and ""you"" to form ""baba is you"" again, but that's already active.

Alternatively, use the ""key"" rule (at 4 up) and move it down with the ""win"" rule to make ""key win"" into ""door win"". But the agent can't reach those upper rules due to walls.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to outline possible steps:

1. Reach the ""stop"" rule at 3 right and 3 up to modify it.
   - Path is blocked by walls at 5 right and 3 up, 2 up, etc. Can't go through walls.

2. Create a rule that makes walls passable.
   - Need ""wall is not stop"". To do this, need ""wall"" and ""is"" and ""not stop"" rules. But ""not"" isn't a property here. Maybe ""wall is push"" or ""wall is you"".

3. Change ""baba"" to be able to push walls.
   - Create ""baba is push"" by moving ""baba"", ""is"", and ""push"" (but there's no ""push"" rule).

4. Alternatively, make walls movable by changing their rule to ""wall is push"".
   - Requires ""wall"", ""is"", ""push"" rules. But ""push"" isn't present. Maybe use ""stop"" instead? Not sure.

Alternatively, since the key is the win, maybe the agent can move the key to a reachable area. But the key is high up, blocked by walls.

Wait, looking at the current objects, the key is at 8 right and 4 up. Below that, there's a wall at 5 right and 4 down. So the key is in the upper part, and the agent is at 2 down. The only way down from the key is through walls. Unless the agent can push the key down by changing the wall rules.

Alternatively, the agent can go around the walls. Let's check the map layout:

From the agent's position at 2 down:

- To the right: there's a wall at 5 right and 2 down (STOP). So can't go right past it.

- To the left: maybe possible, but the observation doesn't show objects to the left, so possibly a cliff or edge.

- Up: there are walls blocking the path upward.

So the only possible movement is down, but that's where the agent already is. Wait, the agent is at 2 steps down. To move down further would be beyond the map, perhaps?

Alternatively, the agent can move left or right around the wall at 5 right and 2 down. For example, move left around it, but the wall is at 5 right, so moving left from there would be 4 right, which might be accessible.

Wait, the wall at 5 right and 2 down is a vertical line? Or just a single block? The observation lists several walls at different positions, but it's a bit unclear. Assuming the wall at 5 right and 2 down is a single block, the agent could move left to 4 right and 2 down, then proceed down or right.

But the agent's current position is at rule `baba` 2 steps down. Let's assume the agent is at (x, 2). The door is at (9, 2). The wall is at (5, 2). So between the agent and the door is the wall at (5,2), then open space to (6,2), (7,2), etc., up to (9,2).

So if the agent can move right past the wall at (5,2), but it's a STOP, so can't. Unless the agent can push it. But to push, the agent needs to be adjacent and have the ability to push, which requires the ""baba is push"" rule or similar.

Since the agent currently is ""baba is you"", which means they can move but can't push STOP objects. So the wall at (5,2) is blocking the path to the door.

Thus, the crux is to remove the STOP property from walls or make them pushable.

The only way to do that is to modify the ""wall is stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 3 right and 3 up. To reach there, the agent needs to move up, but the path is blocked by walls at 5 right and 3 up, 2 up, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can create a new rule nearby that makes walls passable. For example, at the agent's current position, there's a ""rule baba"" block. If the agent can combine it with other rules to create a new rule.

Looking at nearby objects:

- At 1 right and 5 down: rule `is`
- At 2 right and 5 down: rule `you`
- The agent is at 2 down with rule `baba`

So, if the agent moves right to 2 right and 5 down (rule `you`), then perhaps combine ""baba"", ""is"", ""you"" to make ""baba is you"", but that's already active.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule from 1 right and 5 down to somewhere else. For example, move ""is"" to connect with ""stop"" rule to change its property.

But the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right and 3 up, which is far away.

Another idea: Since the key is the win, maybe the agent doesn't need to reach it but can rearrange the rules to make touching the door the win condition. For example, change ""key is win"" to ""door is win"". To do that, the agent needs to move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" rules.

The ""key"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up, ""is"" at 9 right and 4 up, ""win"" at 10 right and 4 up. If the agent can move these down to the door's position (9 right and 2 down","

44,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to reach the door, which is now at 9 steps right and 2 steps down from the current position. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, I'm controlled by Baba, and the key is the thing that makes me win. That means if I get the key, I win. Alternatively, if there's a way to change the win condition, maybe that's another path.

Looking at the objects on the map: there's a key at 8 right, 1 down. The door is at 9 right, 2 down. There's a wall at 5 right, which is directly below me (assuming my current position is at 5 right). The walls are all labeled as stop, so I can't move through them. The rules for wall are part of the existing setup, so unless I can change them, those walls are immovable.

My current position isn't explicitly listed, but based on the objects, maybe I'm at 5 steps right? Because the wall is there, and the rules for wall are 4 step up, 5 right and 4 up, etc. Wait, maybe I'm at 5 right, same as the wall? If that's the case, then I can move left or right, but the wall at 5 right is stop. So moving right into the wall would be blocked. Let's check the objects again.

The key is at 8 right, 1 down. The door is at 9 right, 2 down. So to get to the key, I need to move right from 5 to 8, but there's a wall at 5 right, which is stop. So I can't go right directly. Maybe I need to move around the walls. The walls are spread out: 5 right at various ups and downs. The key is below the wall at 5 right, 1 down. So perhaps I can move down from 5 right to 5 right, 1 down, but that's a wall. Hmm.

Wait, the rule for wall is ""wall is stop"", so any object named wall can't be moved through. But maybe I can move other objects to rearrange the rules. For example, if there are text blocks like ""wall is stop"", ""key is win"", etc., I can move them to create new rules. The key is win, so if I can get to the key, then I win. So the path to the key is blocked by walls, but maybe by rearranging the rules, I can make a path.

Looking at the text blocks: there's ""rule 'key' 8 steps to the right and 4 step up"", ""rule 'is' 9 steps..."", etc. So the key's rule is ""key is win"" located at 8 right, 4 up. The ""win"" part is part of that rule. To get the key, I need to move to its position. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule so that ""baba is win"", making me win just by being Baba. But to do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block to associate with Baba. Let's see where the ""win"" rule is. The active rule is ""key is win"", so the ""win"" is attached to the key. If I can move the ""win"" text block next to Baba, then ""baba is win"" would become active, and touching Baba (me) would make me win. That might be a way.

Baba's rule is at 2 steps down, 1 step to the left. So the text blocks for ""baba"" are at 1 left, 5 steps down. The ""is"" and ""you"" are there. So if I can move the ""win"" text block (which is at 10 right, 4 up) to be next to Baba's rule, that could work. But how to move those text blocks? They might be stop, but if they're not labeled as stop, I can move them. Wait, the rules might have some immovable objects. For example, if a text block is part of a ""stop"" rule, then it's immovable. Let me check the active rules again.

Active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""stop"" rule is part of the wall's definition, but the text blocks for ""stop"" are located at 3 steps right and 3 step up. So maybe those text blocks are movable unless they're part of a stop rule. Wait, no. The ""stop"" property is applied to walls, meaning that walls can't be moved through. But the text blocks that make something a wall (like ""wall is stop"") can be moved unless they're themselves stopped. But in this case, the ""stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 up, and it's part of the wall's definition. So perhaps those text blocks are movable.

So the plan could be: move the ""win"" text block to associate with Baba. To do that, I need to navigate to where the ""baba"" rule is, which is at 1 left, 5 steps down. But getting there might require moving through walls or rearranging other rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the key to the door. Since the key is win, if I can get the key to the door, then stepping on the door with the key would make me win. But how to move the key? The key is an object, and if I'm Baba, which is ""you"", then I can move objects that aren't stop. The walls are stop, but the key, door, and other rules might not be. So if I can move the key towards the door, then place it there. But the key is at 8 right, 1 down. The door is at 9 right, 2 down. So moving the key right and down. But to do that, I need to be adjacent to the key and push it. However, the area around the key might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the map: at 8 right, 1 down is the key. To the right of that is 9 right, 1 down, which is a wall. Below the key is 8 right, 2 down, which is a wall. So the key is in a corner, blocked by walls on the right and below. So pushing the key isn't possible there. Unless there's a way to move the walls by changing their rules.

Alternatively, maybe I can convert a wall into a stop by rearranging the rules. Wait, the walls are already defined as stop. If I can change the rule from ""wall is stop"" to something else, like ""wall is push"", then walls would be movable. Let's see where the ""wall is stop"" rule is. The rule is at 3 right, 3 up. So if I can move that text block, I could change the wall's property. But to move it, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The problem is that the area around the ""wall is stop"" rule might be blocked.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 up. Let's check the objects around there. There's a wall at 5 right, 3 up. So moving left from 5 right, 3 up would be 4 right, 3 up, which might be a free space. But getting to that position requires navigating through other objects. This is getting complicated.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I just need to reach the key. The key is at 8 right, 1 down. My current position is probably at 5 right, same as the wall. To get to the key, I need to move right and down. But moving right is blocked by the wall at 5 right. So perhaps I can move down first, then right. Let's see. If I'm at 5 right, moving down to 5 right, 1 down. But that's a wall. So that's not possible. Alternatively, move up to avoid the wall.

Looking at the map, the wall at 5 right spans from 4 step up to 2 step down. So maybe there's a path around it. For example, moving left from 5 right to 4 right, but is that possible? The objects at 4 right include a wall at 4 right, 1 step up, and others. Wait, the wall at 4 right, 1 step up is part of the same wall structure. So moving left from 5 right to 4 right might be possible if there's no wall there.

Checking the objects: at 4 right, there are walls at various positions, like 4 right, 1 step up; 4 right, 2 steps down, etc. But between 5 right and 4 right, maybe there's a clear path. For example, moving left from 5 right, 4 step up (my current position?), but I'm not sure where exactly I am. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to move the ""key is win"" rule to associate with Baba. So if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching Baba (me) would make me win. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block from the key's rule to the Baba's rule. The ""win"" is at 10 right, 4 up. The Baba's rule is at 1 left, 5 steps down. That's quite a distance. To move the ""win"" block, I need to navigate to its location, push it, and carry it to where the ""baba is you"" rule is.

Let's break it down. The ""win"" block is at 10 right, 4 up. To get there, I need to move right from my current position (probably 5 right) to 10 right, but there are walls blocking the way. The walls at 5 right extend up to 4 step up, so moving up from 5 right might be possible beyond that. For example, moving up from 5 right to 5 right, 4 step up (which is a wall), then left to 4 right, 4 step up, and so on. But this requires moving around the walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the ""key is win"" rule as a whole. If I can move the ""key"" text block, the ""is"" text block, and the ""win"" text block together to form ""baba is win"". That would require rearranging all three parts next to each other. But that's complex and would need precise movement.

Another angle: since the key is win, maybe I can push the key towards the door and then step on it while it's near the door. But the key is at 8 right, 1 down, and the door is at 9 right, 2 down. To push the key right and down, but it's blocked by walls. Unless I can move the walls by changing their rules. For example, if I change ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"", then I could potentially move the walls aside to create a path.

To change the ""wall is stop"" rule, I need to move the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", and ""stop"" so that they form a new rule. Suppose I move the ""stop"" block from 3 right, 3 up to somewhere else, and replace it with a different property. For example, moving ""stop"" to create ""wall is push"". But this requires having the necessary text blocks. The available text blocks include ""wall"", ""is"", ""key"", ""win"", ""baba"", ""you"", etc., located at various positions.

This is quite intricate. Let's think step by step. My current position is likely at 5 right, same as the wall. To move left to 4 right, I need to check if that's possible. Looking at the objects at 4 right: there's a wall at 4 right, 1 step up; 4 right, 2 steps down; etc. But maybe at 4 right, current level (no step up or down), it's a free space. If I can move left to 4 right, then I can navigate around the wall.

Assuming I move left to 4 right. Then, from there, I can move up or down. Let's say I move up towards the ""key is win"" rule. The ""key"" text block is at 8 right, 4 up. That's a distance of 4 steps right and 4 steps up from 4 right. That's a lot, but maybe possible by moving step by step, pushing other text blocks if needed.

Alternatively, focus on moving the ""win"" block to Baba's rule. The ""win"" is at 10 right, 4 up. The Baba's rule is at 1 left, 5 steps down. To move the ""win"" block all the way there, I'd need to carry it past multiple obstacles, which seems difficult. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Wait, the door is at 9 right, 2 down. If I can get the key there, then stepping on the door while holding the key would win. But how to move the key there? The key is at 8 right, 1 down. To move it right to 9 right, but that's blocked by a wall at 9 right, 1 down. To move it down to 8 right, 2 down, which is a wall. So stuck.

Another idea: since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", maybe I can push objects that aren't stop. The key, door, and other rules might be movable. So if I can get to the key and push it towards the door, avoiding walls. But the key's position is surrounded by walls on the right and below. Unless I can move the walls by changing their rules.

Changing the ""wall is stop"" to something else. Let's say I move the ""stop"" text block to create a new rule, like ""rock is stop"" or similar, but there's no rock in the map. Alternatively, make a wall not stop, so it can be pushed. For example, changing ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is push"". Then walls can be moved, and I can use them to create a path.

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block from its current position (3 right, 3 up) to another location. Let's say I want to create ""wall is push"". So I need to have ""wall"", ""is"", ""push"" in adjacent blocks. The ""wall"" is at 1 step up, 4 step up (not sure), wait, the rule `wall` is at 1 step to the left and 1 step up. The ""is"" is at 1 step to the right and 1 step up. The ""stop"" is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step up. So the current rule is ""wall is stop"" formed by those three blocks.

To change it to ""wall is push"", I need to replace ""stop"" with ""push"". The ""push"" text block isn't present in the current objects, so I can't create it unless I can rearrange existing blocks. Wait, the available text blocks are: key, is, win, baba, you, wall. No push. So maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""floor is stop"" to remove the stop property from walls, but again, no floor block.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that since ""key is win"", grabbing the key makes you win, so the path is to reach the key. But the key is blocked by walls. So how to move the walls? By changing their rules.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is at 3 right, 3 up. If I can move that rule, perhaps I can make walls not stop. Let's see. The text blocks for ""wall is stop"" are at:

- rule `wall` at 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- rule `is` at 1 step right and 1 step up
- rule `stop` at 2 steps right and 1 step up

To change this to, say, ""wall is push"", I need to move the ""stop"" to ""push"", but there's no ""push"" block. Alternatively, delete the ""stop"" and create a new rule. But without the necessary blocks, that's not possible.

Another angle: maybe the key can be moved by pushing it through the air. In Baba Is You, sometimes you can push objects off cliffs if there's no floor, but in this case, the key is near walls, so it might not be possible.

Wait, the key is at 8 right, 1 down. Below it is a wall at 8 right, 2 down. So if I push the key down, it would fall into the wall and get stuck. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the door as a win condition. The door is normally not win, but if I can change the rule to ""door is win"", then touching the door would make me win. But the active rule is ""key is win"", so I need to delete that rule or override it.

To delete ""key is win"", I need to move the text blocks away. The ""key is win"" rule is at:

- rule `key` at 8 right, 4 up
- rule `is` at 9 right, 4 up
- rule `win` at 10 right, 4 up

If I can move these blocks apart, the rule ""key is win"" would be deactivated. Then, if I can create a new rule like ""door is win"", touching the door would win. But to do that, I need the ""door"" text block, ""is"", and ""win"" adjacent.

The door is at 9 right, 5 steps down. The ""win"" block is at 10 right, 4 up. The ""is"" block is at 9 right, 4 up. So if I can move the ""win"" block down to where the door is, and form ""door is win"", that could work.

Let's see. The ""win"" block is at 10 right, 4 up. To move it down to 9 right, 5 steps down, I need to carry it past many steps. That's a long way, but possible if there's a clear path. However, the path might be blocked by walls and other rules.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is simpler. Since the key is win, and the key is at 8 right, 1 down, perhaps I can push the key towards me. But I'm at 5 right, so I need to move closer. Wait, if I'm at 5 right, how do I get to 8 right? There's a wall at 5 right blocking the way. Unless I can move the wall by changing its rule.

Wait, another thought: In Baba Is You, sometimes you can push text blocks to create new rules. For example, if you have ""baba"" and ""you","

Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means picking up the key will let me win, and since I'm Baba, I can move around using the ""baba is you"" rule.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 8 steps to the right and 1 step down. The door, which is the win condition, is at 9 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But there are walls (marked as stop) blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout.

The walls are in a straight line to the right from the starting position. So from my current position, moving right directly towards the key and door is blocked by walls. The key is one step down from the wall line. Maybe I need to go down to reach it.

Wait, the rule `baba` is at 2 steps down. So if I move down to that position, I can pick up the rule blocks. The key is at 8 right, 1 down. So from my current position (assuming I'm at the starting point, maybe 0,0), moving down to 2 steps down where the `baba` rule is. Then I can move right towards the key.

But the walls are at 5 steps right, so moving right from there is blocked. However, if I can move the `is` or `you` rules to change the properties, maybe I can make the walls stop being stop. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I could walk through them. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is a win, picking it up would make me a win. So maybe I need to get the key first. Let's see: the path to the key is blocked by a wall at 5 steps right and 1 step down. But the key is at 8 right, 1 down. So from the wall, I need to go right three more steps. But those steps are probably blocked by more walls. Wait, noâ€”the walls are at 5, 5+1=6, 7, 8, etc. So moving right from 5 would hit walls. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 8 steps right and 1 down. The door is at 9 right, 2 down. So maybe the key is just before the door. But how to get there? The walls are every step to the right from 5. So unless I can move past them by changing their properties.

Since I'm Baba, and the rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", maybe I can pick up the ""key"" rule and make it part of me. But to do that, I need to move to the key's position, which is 8 right, 1 down. But the path is blocked by walls. Unless there's a way to make the walls not stop.

Wait, the existing rules have ""wall is stop"" and ""stop"" is at 2 steps right. If I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else, maybe the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"" or change the stop property. But how?

The available rules are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""wall"", etc. The ""is"" rule is at different positions. If I can move the ""is"" to attach to ""wall"" and change its property. Like, if I move ""is"" next to ""wall"" and then add ""not stop"", but I don't have a ""not"" rule. Wait, the original rules have ""wall is stop"", so maybe breaking that rule.

To break ""wall is stop"", I need to move the ""is"" that's attached to ""wall"" and ""stop"". Looking at the objects: there's a rule `is` at 1 step right and 4 steps down, connected to `wall` and `stop`? Not sure. Maybe I need to reposition the ""is"" blocks to redefine the rules.

Alternatively, since the key is win, picking it up will make me win. So the priority is to get to the key. The key is at 8 right, 1 down. To get there, I need to move right from my current position, but the walls are blocking. Maybe I can move the ""stop"" rule away so the walls aren't considered stop anymore. For example, if I move the ""stop"" rule to a different position, then the walls might not block me.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 1 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule to somewhere else, like next to a wall, then that wall might no longer be stop. But how to move it? I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" rule and then move it in a direction, provided that the object I'm moving isn't defined as stop. Since ""baba is you"", and I'm not stop unless a rule says so. But the current rules have ""wall is stop"", not ""baba is stop"", so I can move.

So the plan is: move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 right, 1 up, pick it up, and move it to a different position where it doesn't affect the walls. For example, move it down or left. Once the ""stop"" rule is moved, the walls might no longer be stop, allowing me to pass through them.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""baba is stop"" to prevent myself from touching walls, but that's counterproductive. Hmm.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I can move the ""win"" rule to myself. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching the door (which is win) wouldn't be necessary. But how? To do that, I need to move the ""win"" rule (which is at 10 right, 4 up) to be connected to ""baba"".

But the path to the ""win"" rule is blocked by walls. So again, need to remove the stop property from the walls first.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

Current active rules:
- key is win: picking up the key makes me win.
- baba is you: I can move as Baba.

Obstacles:
- Walls at 5 steps right and varying down positions, marked as stop.
- The key is at 8 right, 1 down, behind a wall at 5 right, 1 down.

Possible steps:
1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 right, 1 up.
2. Pick it up and move it away, so walls aren't stop anymore.
3. Then navigate around the walls to reach the key.

But how to get to the ""stop"" rule? My current position isn't clear, but assuming I'm at the starting point, perhaps 0,0. Let's see:

From the observation, the ""baba"" rule is at 1 step left and 5 steps down in one case, but in the latest observation, it's at 2 steps down. Wait, the latest observation shows rule `baba` at 2 steps down. So maybe I'm at that position.

Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `baba` 2 steps down"". So if I'm currently at the `baba` rule's position (2 steps down), I need to move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 1 step up.

So from 2 steps down, how to get to 2 right, 1 up? Let's calculate the direction:

From current position (assuming it's the `baba` rule's position, which is 2 steps down, but the exact coordinates are unclear). Alternatively, maybe the player's position is implied by the `baba` rule's location.

Alternatively, perhaps the player is at the same position as the `baba` rule. If the `baba` rule is at 2 steps down, then the player (Baba) is there. So to reach the ""stop"" rule at 2 steps right and 1 step up, I need to move right twice and up once. But the path might be blocked.

Wait, the walls are at 5 steps right, so moving right from the `baba` position (which is 2 steps down) would require going through steps 0 to 5, but the walls start at 5 steps right. So moving right from 0 to 5 would encounter walls. Wait, noâ€”the walls are at 5 steps right and various positions up and down. So if I'm at 2 steps down, moving right to 5 steps right would hit a wall (since wall 5 steps right exists at multiple positions). But the ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps right and 1 step up. So from the `baba` position (2 steps down), moving right 2 steps and up 1 would reach the ""stop"" rule.

But the path from 2 steps down to 2 right, 1 up would require moving up first then right, or right then up. Let's see:

If I'm at 0,0 (assuming), but the `baba` rule is at 2 steps down, so maybe the player is at (0, -2)? Not sure. Alternatively, coordinates might be relative. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, think in terms of relative steps. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 1 up from the `baba` position. So from where I am (at `baba`), I need to move up 1 then right 2, or right 2 then up 1. But moving right 2 steps from `baba` (which is at 2 steps down) would take me to 2 right, 2 down. But there's a wall at 5 steps right, which is way further. Wait, noâ€”the walls are at 5 steps right regardless of down. So moving right 2 steps from `baba` (2 down) would be to 2 right, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 5 steps right and various positions. So at 2 right, 2 down, is there a wall? The objects list includes ""wall 4 steps to the right and 4 steps down"", but not at 2 down. So maybe it's safe to move right 2 steps.

So possible actions:

1. Move up 1 to get to the position above `baba`, then right 2 to reach the ""stop"" rule.
2. Alternatively, move right 2 then up 1.

Assuming I can move there without hitting walls. Once I have the ""stop"" rule, move it somewhere else, like to the wall's position, changing its property.

Alternatively, after picking up the ""stop"" rule, move it next to a wall and reattach it to a different property, making the wall not stop.

Once the walls are no longer stop, I can pass through them and reach the key.

So the sequence would be:

- Move to the ""stop"" rule at 2 right, 1 up.
- Pick it up and move it to a new position, say, next to a wall, changing its rule so the wall isn't stop anymore.
- Then navigate to the key at 8 right, 1 down, pass through the now-non-stop walls, pick up the key, and win.

But this requires multiple steps. However, the game might require a single action at this point. Since the last observation had the player (Baba) at 2 steps down, and the ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 1 up, the immediate action would be to move towards that ""stop"" rule.

The possible moves from 2 steps down:

- To get to 2 right, 1 up, the direction would be right 2 and up 1. But since each action is a single step, I need to do this in two actions. But the system might be expecting one action at a time.

In the current observation, after previous defaults to idle, the latest valid observation shows the player at rule `baba` 2 steps down. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 right, 1 up. So from 2 down, to reach 2 right, 1 up, the direction is right then up, or up then right.

Assuming the player can move in any direction step by step, the first step would be to move right to get closer. So the action would be ""right"" to move one step right towards the ""stop"" rule.

Alternatively, move up first. But which direction is correct? The ""stop"" rule is 2 steps right and 1 step up from the player's current position (baba at 2 down). So from the player's position (0,0 assuming), moving right 2 and up 1. But since each action is a single step, the immediate action is to move right.

So the chosen action is ""right"".

Let's see. I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal is usually to reach the ""WIN"" object, which in this case is the key because the active rule says ""key is win"". So I need to get the key.

First, looking at the current observation: Active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So I'm Baba, and the key is what I need to touch to win. The other rules like ""wall is stop"" are still there, meaning walls block movement.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door at 9 steps right and 2 steps down. But the key is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. However, there are walls blocking the path. Let me visualize the layout.

From the observation:

- The wall starts at 4 steps right and goes up to 4 steps up, then down to 1 step down, etc. So the structure is a vertical wall on the right side, maybe a column of walls from up to down.

- The key is at 7 right, 1 down. But between me (Baba) and the key, there's a wall at 4 right and 1 down. Wait, maybe my position isn't specified. Wait, the objects list includes ""rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So Baba's position is at 1 left, 2 down. So my current location is 1 left, 2 down.

The key is at 7 right, 1 down. So from my position (1 left, 2 down), moving right would get me towards the key. But there's a wall at 4 steps right. So moving straight right from my position: I'm at 1 left, so if I move right, I'd be at 0, then 1, 2, 3, 4 steps right. But the wall is at 4 steps right, which is a STOP. So I can't move past that wall. So I need to find a way around it.

Looking at the other objects: There's a door at 8 right, 2 down. The key is at 7 right, 1 down. Maybe I can push the wall to move it out of the way? But can I push walls? The rules say ""wall is stop"", which means they can't be moved unless their property is changed. So unless I can change the rule to make walls movable, like ""push is you"" or something, but I don't see that here.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule to negate the wall's stop property. For example, if I can make ""wall is not stop"", then I could move through it. To do that, I need to find the text blocks that make wall a stop and destroy or move them. The current active rule for wall is ""wall is stop"", which is formed by the text blocks: rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 4 step up, rule `is` 1 step to the right and 3 step up, rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up. So those three text blocks form the ""wall is stop"" rule.

If I can move or remove these text blocks, I can change the rule. But to move a text block, I have to be adjacent to it and it shouldn't be defined as stop. The ""stop"" property is on the wall, not on the text blocks. So the text blocks themselves aren't stopped, so I can move them.

So the plan is: find the text blocks that make wall a stop and move them away. Then, the wall might no longer be a stop, allowing me to pass.

Let's look at the positions of the text blocks for ""wall is stop"":

1. rule `wall` at 1 left, 4 up
2. rule `is` at 1 right, 3 up
3. rule `stop` at 2 right, 3 up

These three form the ""wall is stop"" rule. If I can move any of these, the rule will break. For example, moving the ""stop"" text block away would disable the rule.

But how to reach them? My current position is 1 left, 2 down. Let's see the positions:

- The ""stop"" text block is at 2 right, 3 up. From my position (1 left, 2 down), moving up three steps would get me to 3 up, but my current y is 2 down. Wait, the coordinates might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions correctly.

The positions are given as [direction] steps [up/down/left/right] from some reference point, probably the starting position of Baba. But maybe it's better to consider the grid based on the observations.

Alternatively, perhaps all positions are relative to Baba's current location. For example, ""rule `wall` 1 step to the left and 4 step up"" would be 1 left and 4 up from Baba's position.

Wait, Baba's position is at 1 left and 2 down. So if a rule is 1 left and 4 up from Baba, that would be:

Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- 1 left and 4 up: (-1, 4)
- 1 right and 3 up: (1, 3)
- 2 right and 3 up: (2, 3)

The ""stop"" text block is at (2,3). From Baba's position (0,0), to reach (2,3), the path would be right twice, up three times. But the way there is blocked by walls. Let's see:

From (0,0) (Baba's position):

Moving right to (1,0), then (2,0). But looking at the walls:

At 4 steps right, there's a wall at various positions, but perhaps the vertical wall starts at 4 right. So moving right past 4 steps is blocked. Wait, the wall objects are at:

wall 4 steps to the right and 4 step up

wall 4 steps to the right and 3 step up

etc., down to wall 4 steps to the right (which would be (4,0)), and then down to (4,1), (4,2), etc.

So the vertical wall is on the x=4 line, from y=0 down to y=4 (but in the observations, the highest y is 4 step up, so maybe the coordinate system is inverted? Or perhaps up is positive y and down is negative.)

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to focus on the text blocks that need to be moved.

The ""stop"" text block is at 2 right, 3 up from Baba. To get there, Baba needs to move right twice and up three times. But along the way, from (0,0) to (2,3):

- Right to (1,0): no walls mentioned here.
- Right to (2,0): no walls mentioned.
- Up to (2,1): check if there's a wall. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps right, which is far to the right. So moving up from (2,0) to (2,1) is possible.
- Up to (2,2): same, no walls mentioned here.
- Up to (2,3): that's where the ""stop"" text block is.

But wait, the vertical wall starts at 4 steps right. So positions (0-3, any) are open except where there are other walls. So moving to (2,3) should be possible. However, the ""stop"" text block is at (2,3), and to move it, I need to be adjacent to it.

So the steps would be:

1. Move right twice to (2,0).
2. Move up three times to (2,3), reaching the ""stop"" text block.
3. Move the ""stop"" text block somewhere else, like to the left or down, to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.

But how to move the text block? In Baba Is You, you can push text blocks by moving into them when you're touching them, provided that you're a ""you"" object. Since the rule is ""baba is you"", I can push text blocks.

So from (2,3), the ""stop"" text block is at that position. To move it, I need to push it. Let's say I move left from (2,3) to (1,3), pushing the ""stop"" text block to (0,3). That would break the ""wall is stop"" rule because the three text blocks needed to form the rule are no longer in place.

Alternatively, moving it down to (2,4), but I need to check if that's possible.

Once the ""wall is stop"" rule is destroyed, the walls might become passable. Then I can go around them to get to the key.

Alternatively, if I can make the wall a different property, like ""wall is push"", but that might not help. The main goal is to remove the ""stop"" property from walls.

So the plan is:

- Reach the ""stop"" text block at (2,3).
- Push it left or down to break the rule.
- Then, the walls are no longer stopping, so I can move through them to reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can move other text blocks that form the ""wall is stop"" rule. For example, moving the ""is"" or ""wall"" text blocks.

But the ""stop"" text block is the last piece. Let's focus on that.

From current position (1 left, 2 down) which we'll consider as (0,0):

- The ""stop"" block is at (2,3).
- Path: right to (1,0), right to (2,0), up to (2,1), up to (2,2), up to (2,3).

But need to confirm if there are any walls along this path. Looking at the objects:

- Walls are at 4 steps right in various positions. So from x=0 to x=3, there are no walls except maybe at specific y positions. For example, wall 4 steps right and 1 step up is at (4,1), which is beyond x=3. So moving right to x=2 is safe.

Once I reach (2,3), I can push the ""stop"" block left to (1,3) or down to (2,4). Let's say I push it left to (1,3). Then the ""wall is stop"" rule is destroyed because all three text blocks need to be in place.

After that, the walls are no longer stop, so I can move through them. Then I can go to the key at (7 right, 1 down). But how to get there?

From (0,0) after moving the ""stop"" block, I can move right past the wall at x=4, since walls are no longer stop. So go right to x=4, then continue right to x=7, down to y=1.

Wait, the key is at 7 steps right and 1 step down. So from (0,0), moving right 7 times and down once. But there's a wall at x=4, but since walls are no longer stop, I can move through them. So the path would be right, right, right, right, right, right, right (seven times) and down once.

But that's a lot of steps. Maybe there's a closer path. Alternatively, after removing the ""stop"" rule, the vertical wall at x=4 is just a regular wall that I can pass through.

Alternatively, maybe there's a door at (8,2) which might be a WIN if the door is OPEN, but the active rule is ""key is win"", so the door might not be relevant unless I change the rules.

Alternatively, perhaps I can create a new rule to make the door a win, but that's probably not necessary if I can get the key.

So the main steps are:

1. Move to the ""stop"" text block at (2,3).
2. Push it left or down to break the ""wall is stop"" rule.
3. Move through the former wall at x=4 to reach the key at (7,1).

But how to execute this in the game's action commands.

The problem is that each action is a single step: up, down, left, right, or idle.

So from the current position (1 left, 2 down) which is (0,0), I need to:

1. Move right twice: right, right.
2. Move up three times: up, up, up.
3. Now at (2,3). Check if there's a wall here? The objects list includes ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the right and 3 step up"", which is the text block, not a wall. So it's a movable object.
4. Push the ""stop"" text block. To push it, I need to move in the direction opposite to where I want to push it. For example, to push it left, I need to move left from (2,3) to (1,3), which would move the ""stop"" block to (0,3).

So after moving left, the ""stop"" block is now at (0,3), breaking the ""wall is stop"" rule.

Then, I can move freely through the walls. So from (1,3), move down to (1,2), then right to (4,2) (since walls are no longer stop), and continue right to (7,2), then down to (7,1), which is the key's position.

But each of these steps requires individual actions. However, the user is asking for a single action to choose now. The current observation is after previous actions, and I need to choose the next action.

Looking at the last observed state before the current one:

The previous action was ""right"", leading to the current observation where Baba is at rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down (which is our position (1 left, 2 down)), and the key is at 7 right, 1 down.

In the current observation, the active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The key is at 7 right, 1 down, but there's a wall at 4 steps right. However, if we break the ""wall is stop"" rule, we can move through.

But to do that, we need to reach the ""stop"" text block at 2 right, 3 up. From our current position (1 left, 2 down), which is (0,0), moving right twice gets us to (2,0). Then up three times gets us to (2,3). Then push left to (1,3), moving the ""stop"" block.

But since each action is a single step, the next immediate action should be to move right to get closer to the ""stop"" block.

Wait, in the current observation, after the last action ""right"", where are we?

Let me check the previous steps. The user's last action was ""right"", leading to the observation where Baba is at rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So after moving right once, we're at that position.

Wait, the initial position might have been different. Let's track the movement:

Initially, the user started with ""left"", then ""up"", ""left"", ""right"", ""down"", etc. But after several steps, the positions of Baba and the text blocks changed as walls were moved.

In the latest observation before the current one, after the action ""right"", the observation shows:

Objects on the map include rule `baba` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So that means Baba's position is 1 left and 2 down from the reference point (perhaps the starting position).

So to get to the ""stop"" text block at 2 right, 3 up, from here, the direction would be:

From (1 left, 2 down), moving right would take us to 0 left (original position?), or perhaps the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing without a visual grid.

Alternatively, maybe the positions are absolute. For example, the ""stop"" text block is at x=2, y=3 (assuming up is positive y). Baba is at x=-1, y=-2 (since 1 left is x=-1, 2 down is y=-2).

To reach x=2, y=3 from (-1,-2):

The path would be:

Right (+1 to x), right (+1 to x=1), right (+1 to x=2).

Up (+1 to y), up (+1 to y=1), up (+1 to y=2), up (+1 to y=3).

So total steps: right, right, right, up, up, up.

But each action is a single step. The next action should be the first step towards that path, which is ""right"".

But in the current observation, after the previous actions, where is Baba located? The observation states that rule `baba` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. Assuming that's the position relative to the starting point, moving right once would get Baba to 0 left and 2 down.

Then the next step would be to move right again to 1 left and 2 down, then up, etc.

But perhaps in the current state, the immediate action needed is to move right to start the path towards the ""stop"" text block.

Alternatively, if the ""stop"" text block is located at 2 right and 3 up from Baba's current position, then from Baba's current position (1 left, 2 down), moving right twice and up three times is required.

But since each action is a single step, the next logical action is to move right to get closer.

Alternatively, maybe the key is reachable if we can move around the wall by pushing it. But the wall is at 4 steps right, which is far from the key's position at 7 steps right. So pushing the wall at 4 right wouldn't help reach the key at 7 right.

Therefore, the correct approach is to eliminate the ""wall is stop"" rule by moving the ""stop"" text block. The next action should be to move right to get closer to the ""stop"" block.

But wait, in the current observation, after the previous actions, where is Baba located? The latest observation before the current one (after action ""right"") shows Baba at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down. So to move towards the ""stop"" block at 2 right, 3 up, the first step is to move right.

Therefore, the chosen action should be ""right"".

door 7 steps to the right and 2 steps down",0,False
47,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out the solution here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means if I can get the key, I win since the key is considered the win object. But the key is down somewhere, and there are walls blocking the path.

Looking at the current observation, the key is at 6 steps right and 1 step down. The door is at 7 steps right and 2 steps down. The rule blocks are shifting, probably because the walls are moving each time I move. Wait, no, in Baba Is You, the walls might be static, but the rules can change. Let me check the objects again.

The rule 'wall' is at 2 steps left and 4 up, and there are walls at 3 steps right and various positions. The Baba rule is at 2 steps left and 2 steps down, with ""is"" and ""you"" next to it. So maybe I can move those text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""BABA IS WIN"" or something like that, then I become the win condition. 

But how do I get past the walls? The walls are labeled as stop, so I can't move through them unless I change their property. Right now, the only movable things might be the text blocks that aren't stop. The key is down, but there's a wall at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. The door is behind that wall. 

Wait, the key is at 6 right, 1 down. So from my current position (which isn't specified, but based on previous steps, maybe I'm near the Baba text blocks), I need to get to the key. But the path is blocked by walls. To move the walls, I might need to rearrange the rules. For example, if I can move the ""STOP"" rule away from the path, then I can pass through. 

Looking at the objects, there's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can remove the stop property from the wall. But how? I need to touch the rule blocks. Suppose I'm near the ""baba"" rule at 2 left and 2 down. If I move right, I can get to the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks. Maybe combining ""baba"" with ""win"" using the ""is"" block would create ""BABA IS WIN"", making me the win object. 

So the plan is: move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create the new rule. Then, I can walk over the door since I'd be the win. But how to get to those blocks? The current position isn't clear, but previous steps show movement down and right. Let me check the last few observations. Earlier, I was moving down multiple times, and now the key is at 6 right, 1 down. The Baba rule is at 2 left and 2 down. So maybe I'm at the position of the Baba rule. To move the ""is"" block from 1 left and 2 down to next to ""baba"" and ""win"", I need to move right or left. 

Alternatively, maybe I should go down to the key first. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. From the current position (assuming I'm near 3 right, something), moving right and down. But there's a wall at 3 right and 2 down. If I can remove the stop property from that wall, then I can pass. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. To reach it, I might need to move up, but there are walls blocking. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the key isn't necessary if I can make myself the win. Let's focus on that. The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up. To create ""baba is win"", I need to have the ""is"" block between ""baba"" and ""win"". The ""is"" block is currently at 7 right and 4 up (rule 'is' 7 steps to the right and 4 step up). So if I can move that ""is"" block down to where the ""baba"" rule is (2 left and 2 down), then combine them. 

But how do I move the ""is"" block? I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Let's see, the ""is"" block is at 7 right and 4 up. The current position might be near there. If I move down from there, I can get to the lower level. Alternatively, if I'm at the Baba rule's position (2 left, 2 down), I need to get the ""is"" block there. 

This requires navigating through the map. Let's map out the positions:

- ""baba"" rule: 2 left, 2 down
- ""is"" rule: 7 right, 4 up
- ""you"" rule: 2 steps down (assuming it's next to the ""is"")
- ""win"" rule: 8 right, 4 up
- key: 6 right, 1 down
- door: 7 right, 2 down

So to create ""baba is win"", I need to move the ""is"" from 7 right,4 up to between ""baba"" (2 left,2 down) and ""win"" (8 right,4 up). But that's a long distance. Alternatively, maybe create ""baba is win"" by moving the existing ""is"" down to the ""baba"" and ""win"" positions. 

Alternatively, the ""is"" block at 1 step left and 2 steps down (from current observation) could be used. Wait, in the current observation, the ""is"" is at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So if I can move that ""is"" to connect ""baba"" (2 left, 2 down) and ""win"" (which is at 8 right,4 up), but that's not adjacent. Maybe there's another ""is"" block at 3 step up. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to focus on the current observation's objects:

- rule `baba` is at 2 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` is at 1 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `you` is at 2 steps down
- The ""win"" rule is at 8 right and 4 up, which is much higher up.

So perhaps the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""you"" is at 1 left and 2 down. If I can move that ""is"" block to the right to connect ""baba"" with ""win"", but ""win"" is far up. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to make ""baba"" the win by moving the ""win"" rule down. 

Wait, the ""win"" rule is part of the active rule ""key is win"". To change that, I need to move the ""win"" text block. If I can move the ""win"" block next to ""baba"" and an ""is"" block, then ""baba is win"" would be created, making me the win. 

The ""win"" block is currently at 8 right and 4 up. To get it down to the level of ""baba"" (2 left, 2 down), I need to move it down multiple steps. But each move can only be one step at a time. That's a lot of steps, but maybe possible. 

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" block at 1 left and 2 down. If I can move that ""is"" to the right and down to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". But the ""win"" is up high. 

This might take several moves. Let's think step by step. 

Current position is unknown, but based on previous actions, maybe I'm near the ""baba"" rule. Let's assume I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule (2 left, 2 down). To create ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"" + ""is"" + ""win"" in adjacent blocks. 

The ""is"" block is at 1 left and 2 down (same level as ""baba""). The ""win"" block is at 8 right and 4 up. So to connect them, I need to move the ""is"" block to the right to be next to ""baba"", then move the ""win"" block down, but that's difficult. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" block at 7 right and 4 up (from previous observations). But in the current observation, the ""is"" is at 1 left and 2 down. 

Alternatively, maybe the key isn't needed anymore if I can make myself the win. So focus on rearranging the rules. 

If I can move the ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"", that would do it. Let's see: the ""is"" is at 1 left, 2 down. Moving it right to adjacent to ""baba"" (which is at 2 left, 2 down). So moving the ""is"" block one step to the right would place it at 0 left, 2 down, next to ""baba"". Then, I need to get the ""win"" block next to that ""is"". The ""win"" block is at 8 right, 4 up. That's a far distance. Maybe instead, use another ""is"" block. 

Wait, in the current observation, there's also a ""is"" block at 3 step up. Let me check: the objects list includes ""rule `is` 3 step up"". So another ""is"" is at 3 up. Maybe that's closer. 

If I move that ""is"" block down to the level of ""baba"" and ""you"", then connect ""baba"" with ""is"" and ""win"". But ""win"" is still up high. 

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to first reach the key and then use it at the door. The key is at 6 right, 1 down. The door is at 7 right, 2 down. To get to the key, I need to move right and down, but there's a wall at 3 right and 2 down. If I can remove the stop property from that wall, then I can pass. 

To remove the stop property, I need to change the rule that makes it a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right and 3 up. So if I can move that ""stop"" rule away, then the wall at 3 right and 2 down would no longer be a stop. 

How to move the ""stop"" rule? I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" is at 1 right, 3 up. From the current position (assuming near the ""baba"" rule at 2 left, 2 down), moving up three steps and right one step would reach the ""stop"" rule. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, at 3 steps right and 2 up there's a wall. 

Alternatively, find a path using other movable objects. But since walls are stop, I can't move through them. Maybe use text blocks to redirect movement. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to create ""baba is win"" by moving the existing ""is"" block next to ""baba"" and ""win"". Let's try that. 

The ""is"" block is at 1 left, 2 down. Moving it right to be next to ""baba"" (2 left, 2 down) would place it at 0 left, 2 down. Then, the ""win"" block is at 8 right, 4 up. That's too far down. Alternatively, use the ""win"" block that's part of the active rule ""key is win"". To change that rule, I need to touch the ""win"" block and move it. 

But how? Maybe the key is a distraction. If I can make myself the win by creating ""baba is win"", then I can walk over the door. 

To do that, I need to have ""baba"" + ""is"" + ""win"" in adjacent blocks. The ""is"" is at 1 left, 2 down. The ""baba"" is at 2 left, 2 down. So moving the ""is"" one step to the right would place it between ""baba"" and the next block. Then, need the ""win"" block next to that. But the ""win"" is up high. 

Alternatively, use the ""win"" block that's part of the ""key is win"" rule. If I can move that ""win"" block down to the level of ""baba"". 

This requires multiple moves. For example, move the ""win"" block down step by step. Each move would require being adjacent to it. 

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe picking up the key and then using it at the door. But the door is behind a wall. If I can remove the wall's stop property, then I can go through. 

To remove the wall's stop property, I need to change the rule that makes it a stop. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. Moving that rule away would make the wall not stop. 

So the steps could be:

1. Move to the ""stop"" rule at 1 right, 3 up.
2. Move it down to a position that doesn't affect the walls.
3. Then, go through the wall to the door.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Let's see, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 right, 3 up. To move it down, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Suppose I'm at 0 right, 3 up, then move down to 1 right, 3 up (the ""stop"" rule), then push it down to 1 right, 2 up. Repeating this until it's moved away. 

Once the ""stop"" rule is removed, the wall at 3 right, 2 down is no longer stop, so I can move through. Then go to the door at 7 right, 2 down, which is win. 

Alternatively, pick up the key first. But the key is at 6 right, 1 down. To get there, move right and down, but the path is blocked by walls. 

This is quite involved. Given the time constraints, maybe the best action now is to move right towards the ""is"" block to connect with ""baba"" and create the new rule. 

Looking at the current observation, the ""is"" block is at 1 left, 2 down. If I'm at the ""baba"" rule's position (2 left, 2 down), moving right once would put me next to the ""is"" block. Then, pushing the ""is"" block to the right to connect with ""baba"". 

So the action would be to move right to get next to the ""is"" block, then push it right to be next to ""baba"". But since each action is a single step, maybe first move right once to be adjacent to the ""is"" block, then another right to push it. 

But the current action needs to be one of the listed actions: up, down, left, right, or idle. 

Given that, the immediate action to take is to move right to get to the ""is"" block. 

So the chosen action is right.

Let's see. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But according to the usual Baba Is You puzzles, normally you need to reach the door which is the win object, but here it's set that key is win. Or maybe the door is still there, but the key is the objective now.

Looking at the objects on the map:

There's a key located at 5 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's also a door at 6 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But since the rule is ""key is win"", touching the key should complete the level. 

Now, the player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba's position is somewhere that's 3 steps left from the current reference point (maybe the center?), and 2 steps down. The key is to the right and one step down from there. 

The path to the key seems blocked. There's a wall at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down, and another wall at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Also, there's a ""stop"" rule at 3 steps up, which might mean that certain objects can't be moved. 

Wait, the walls are positioned such that moving directly right from Baba's position would hit a wall. So how to get past the wall? Since we can move text blocks, maybe we need to rearrange the rules to bypass the wall. 

Looking at the available text blocks: There's a ""rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"". That's Baba's own rule. Also, there's ""rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"", ""rule `you` 1 step to the left and 2 steps down"". Maybe I can pick up one of these rules and move them to change the properties. 

If I can make the wall a ""stop"" or something else, but ""stop"" is already a rule. Alternatively, if I can make the key a ""push"" or something, but I don't see a push rule here. 

Alternatively, maybe change the ""baba is you"" rule to ""baba is push"", then move the wall. But to do that, I need to grab the ""is"" or ""you"" text blocks. 

Baba's position is at 3 steps left and 2 steps down. The ""rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"" is adjacent to Baba. So if I move right, maybe I can reach that ""is"" rule. 

Wait, the current position of the ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from Baba's position. So if Baba is at, say, coordinate (0,0), the ""is"" rule is at (-2, -2). But the movement directions are relative. Maybe the exact positions are a bit confusing, but the key point is that the ""is"" rule is nearby. 

By moving right from Baba's current position, perhaps I can grab the ""is"" rule and then create a new rule. For example, if I can make ""baba is push"" or ""wall is stop"", but I need to see the available text blocks. 

Alternatively, if I can change the ""key is win"" rule to something else, but that might not help. The goal is to get the key, so maybe the key is already the win, so touching it should be enough. But the path is blocked by walls. 

So the main challenge is moving around the walls. Since the walls are defined as rules, maybe I can move the wall rules to create a path. For example, if I can make a wall into a ""stop"" which is immovable, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I can make the wall into something else that can be pushed. 

Wait, the ""stop"" property makes objects immovable. If the walls are ""wall"" and ""stop"", maybe moving the ""stop"" rule to attach to the wall, making it even more immovable. Not sure. 

Alternatively, if I can make the key a ""push"" property, then maybe push it over the wall. But the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. There's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So the key is 3 steps away from the wall. If I can push the key past the wall, but I need to be able to push it. 

But to push, Baba needs to be a ""push"" or the object being pushed needs to be ""push"" or ""move"". The current rules don't have push, so maybe I need to create that. 

Looking at the available text blocks: there's a ""rule `is`"" at 2 steps left and 2 steps down. If I can pick that ""is"" and create a new rule like ""key is push"", then maybe the key can be pushed. But then how to get past the wall? 

Alternatively, create a rule that makes Baba able to move through walls by redefining ""wall is stop"" to ""wall is nothing"". But to do that, I need to move the ""wall"" rule. 

The ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 4 step up"" is present. If I can move that rule, I can change what ""wall"" is. For example, moving it to say ""wall is you"" or something. But that might cause issues. 

But the problem is that to move any text block, the subject of the rule must not be ""stop"" or similar. So if I can make Baba a ""push"" or ""move"", then he can move the text blocks. 

Currently, Baba is ""you"", so he can move, but he can't push unless there's a ""push"" rule. So maybe I need to create a ""baba is push"" rule. 

To do that, I need to find an ""is"" rule nearby. The ""rule `is` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"" is close. If I move right twice to reach that ""is"" rule, then I can append ""baba"" and ""push"" to create ""baba is push"". 

But the movement path: from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), moving right once would take him to 2 left, 2 down. Is there an object there? There's the ""rule `is`"" at 2 left, 2 down. So moving right once would allow him to grab that ""is"" rule. Then, he can move right again to a different position and place the new rule. 

Once ""baba is push"" is active, he could potentially push objects, including walls. Then, he could push the wall aside to reach the key. 

Alternatively, if he makes the wall a ""stop"", but that doesn't help. Alternatively, make the wall a ""win"", but that's not necessary. 

So the plan is:

1. Move right to pickup the ""is"" rule.
2. Move to a new position and create ""baba is push"".
3. Use the push ability to move the wall out of the way.
4. Then go to the key and pick it up, which would win the level since ""key is win"".

But how exactly to navigate? Let's look at the current positions again.

Baba's position: rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So assuming the reference point is perhaps the top-left corner, but the exact coordinates are a bit abstract. 

The ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from Baba. So if Baba moves right once, he can reach that ""is"" rule. 

Then, moving right again to a position where he can place the new rule. For example, moving right twice would place him at 1 step left and 2 steps down. Then, placing ""baba is push"" there. 

Once that's done, Baba can push the walls. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 steps right and 1 step up, and others below. The key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down. The wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down is blocking the path to the key. 

If Baba can push that wall, he can move it away. To push, he needs to be adjacent to the wall and have the push ability. 

So after becoming ""baba is push"", moving down to the wall's position, then pushing it left or right. 

But the key is to the right of the wall. So if the wall is at 2 steps right and 1 step down, and the key is at 5 steps right and 1 step down, the wall is between Baba and the key. If Baba pushes the wall to the left (towards lower steps right), then the path is cleared. 

However, moving the wall might require specific steps. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is at 5 right, 1 down, and there's a door at 6 right, 2 down. But the focus is on the key because of the active rule. 

Another angle: Maybe the door is still a win if it's a door, but the rule says key is win, so touching the key should be enough. 

So the steps would be:

- Move to the key's location, but path is blocked by walls. 
- Rearrange rules to remove the block. 
- Either push the wall or redefine the wall to something movable. 

Given the available text blocks, the most feasible seems to be creating a ""baba is push"" rule, then pushing the wall. 

So the sequence of actions would involve:

1. Move right to grab the ""is"" rule.
2. Move to a new position to create ""baba is push"".
3. Move to the wall's position and push it aside.
4. Move to the key and pick it up. 

Now, let's check the current observation again to see the exact positions. 

Baba is at rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. The ""is"" rule is 2 step to the left and 2 steps down. So moving right once gets him to the ""is"" rule. Then moving right again to, say, 1 step left and 2 steps down. 

Once ""baba is push"" is created, he can move down to the wall at 2 steps right and 1 step down. Pushing the wall left (decreasing the right steps) would move it to 1 step right and 1 step down, clearing the path to the key. 

Then, moving right past the pushed wall to reach the key at 5 steps right and 1 step down. 

But how to execute these moves step by step. 

The previous actions were a series of left, right, up, down movements, but sometimes leading to dead ends. 

In the current observation, after several right moves, the key is getting closer, but the walls are still in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to redefine the wall rule. For example, moving the ""wall"" rule to change its property. 

The ""rule `wall` 3 step to the left and 4 step up"" is present. If Baba can move that rule, he could change what a wall is. For example, moving it to say ""wall is nothing"", making walls passable. 

But to do that, he needs to grab the ""wall"" rule and move it. However, the subject of the rule (wall) is not ""stop"", so he can move it. 

So steps:

1. Move to the ""wall"" rule at 3 left, 4 up.
2. Move it to a new position, say, changing it to ""wall is nothing"". 
3. Then, the walls are passable, and Baba can walk through them to reach the key. 

But how to navigate to that ""wall"" rule. Given the current position of Baba, which is 3 left and 2 down, moving up several steps to reach the ""wall"" rule at 3 left, 4 up. 

From Baba's position (3 left, 2 down), moving up 4 steps would get to 3 left, 6 down? Wait, maybe the coordinate system is different. This part is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ""wall"" rule is above the current map. If the map has a grid, moving up from Baba's position would lead to higher Y coordinates. 

But given that previous moves have been leading down and right, maybe the ""wall"" rule is in an upper part of the map that hasn't been explored yet. 

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is simpler. Since the key is defined as win, maybe the door is no longer relevant. So the goal is to reach the key. 

The key is at 5 right, 1 down. The path is blocked by a wall at 2 right, 1 down. 

If I can make that wall a ""stop"", but it's already a stop. Or make it something else. 

Alternatively, use the ""key is win"" rule to pick up the key. But to pick up the key, Baba needs to be adjacent to it. 

But the wall is in between. So unless the wall can be moved or removed. 

Another idea: Since the rule ""key is win"" is present, maybe Baba can move the ""win"" rule to the door, but that's not necessary. 

Alternatively, use the ""is"" rule to create a new rule that allows Baba to move through walls. For example, ""baba is move"" or ""baba is push"". 

But to do that, need to have the ""is"" rule nearby. 

Given the current observation, the ""is"" rule is 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down from Baba. So moving right once gets to that ""is"" rule. 

Once grabbed, move right again and create ""baba is push"". Then, move down to the wall and push it. 

But how to execute this in the game. 

The exact sequence of moves would be:

1. Move right once to reach the ""is"" rule.
2. Move right again to a position to place the new rule.
3. Create ""baba is push"".
4. Move down to the wall at 2 right, 1 down.
5. Push the wall left to 1 right, 1 down.
6. Move right past the wall to the key at 5 right, 1 down.
7. Touch the key to win. 

But in the game, each move is a single step. So navigating from Baba's position (3 left, 2 down) to the key requires careful planning. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, if the ""key is win"" rule is already active, perhaps Baba can just move directly to the key once the path is clear. 

But the key is blocked. 

Another possibility: Maybe the door is behind the key, but since the rule is ""key is win"", reaching the key is enough. 

In any case, the critical step is removing the wall blocking the path. 

Given that, the best action now is to move right to grab the ""is"" rule and create a ""baba is push"" rule. 

But looking at the latest observation, after several right moves, the key is now at 5 right, 1 down, and the wall is at 2 right, 1 down. 

Baba's current position is rule `baba` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down. So to move right, he would be moving towards the ""is"" rule at 2 left, 2 down. 

So moving right once would place him at 2 left, 2 down, which is the ""is"" rule. Then, moving right again to 1 left, 2 down, and placing the new rule ""baba is push"" there. 

Once that's done, he can move down to the wall at 2 right, 1 down (but his current position after placing the rule would be 1 left, 2 down, which is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down from there). 

Alternatively, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the immediate next step is to move right to grab the ""is"" rule. 

So the chosen action is ""right"".

Let me try to figure out the next step here. The goal is usually to reach the ""door"" which is the WIN object, but in this level, the rule says ""key is win"", so maybe grabbing the key makes me WIN? Or maybe the door is still the target, but since key is win, perhaps I need to interact with the key differently.

Looking at the current observation, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, as Baba, if I can get the key, does that make me the WIN? Or does the key itself become the win condition? The ""key is win"" rule probably means that the key is now what we need to reach or interact with to win. But earlier in the game, the door was the win condition. Maybe the key is the new win object.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. There are walls around, some marked as stop. So my path might be blocked. Let me check the positions again.

The rule `baba` is at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, that would place Baba somewhere else. But since ""baba is you"", I need to move that Baba tile. Wait, the objects list includes rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So that's the rule that defines Baba as YOU. So to move Baba, I need to move that rule tile, right? Because the subject of the rule is ""baba"", so moving that rule would change what Baba is.

But how do I move the rule `baba`? The rules can be moved if they're not STOP. Looking at the rules, the `stop` rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. So other rules might be movable. The `baba` rule is at 4 step left and 2 steps down. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. But where is Baba currently located? The rule `baba` is a text block, so the actual Baba entity might be a separate object. Wait, in Baba Is You, the subjects and properties are rules, but the entities (like Baba) are represented by their rule tiles. So if the rule is ""baba is you"", then the Baba tile is a movable object unless there's a STOP rule affecting it.

Wait, the current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So Baba is you, meaning I can move Baba (the tile) around, provided it's not stopped. Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right, 4 steps up, and other walls. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. The door is at 5 right, 2 down.

But how do I get to the key? The path might be blocked by walls. Let me map out the positions. The rule `baba` is at 4 left and 2 down. So if I can move that rule, maybe I can reposition Baba. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the key to make it the win condition, but the rule says key is already win. Hmm.

Wait, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. The door is at 5 right, 2 down. There's a wall at 1 right, 2 steps down. So to get to the door, I might need to go right past the wall. But if the key is win, maybe I need to pick up the key to become the win condition. So moving to the key's position.

But the key is at 4 right, 1 down. My current position (Baba's rule) is at 4 left and 2 down. So I need to move right towards the key. But how? The rule `baba` is a text block, so to move it, I have to push it if it's not stopped. Let's check if there's a STOP rule affecting the `baba` rule. The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up, which is not near the `baba` rule. So the `baba` rule can be moved.

So the plan is: move the `baba` rule (which makes me Baba, the YOU) to a position where I can then move towards the key. Wait, no. The `baba` rule is the text block that defines Baba as YOU. To move Baba, I need to move that rule. So if I move the `baba` rule to the right, then the new position of the Baba rule would mean that the Baba entity is there, allowing me to move it.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. In Baba Is You, the rules are separate from the objects. The ""baba is you"" rule means that the Baba tile is a YOU object, so you can move it. To move the Baba tile, you have to move the corresponding rule tile. So if the rule `baba` is at a certain position, that's where the Baba entity is. So moving the rule `baba` would move the Baba entity.

In the current observation, the rule `baba` is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the actual Baba entity is at that position. To move Baba, I need to push the `baba` rule tile. Let's see if that's possible. Are there any STOP rules preventing movement? The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up, which is not in the vicinity of the `baba` rule. So I can try to move the `baba` rule to the right, which would move the Baba entity.

So if I move the `baba` rule to the right, then I can control the new position of Baba. Let's see: the current position of the `baba` rule is 4 left and 2 down. If I move it right by one step, it would be 3 left and 2 down. Then, from there, I can move right towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust other rules. But the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the key is the win condition. To win, I need to reach the key. So the goal is to get to the key's position. But how?

The key is at 4 right, 1 down. My current position (Baba's rule) is at 4 left and 2 down. So the distance is 8 steps to the right and 1 step up. But there are walls blocking the path. For example, wall at 5 steps right and various positions. Also, the door is at 5 right, 2 down. So maybe moving right past the door's position.

Wait, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. So to get there, I need to go right 4 steps from my current position (which is 4 left, 2 down). Wait, no: current position of the `baba` rule is 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So in actual coordinates, if we consider the player's position as (0,0), then moving right would increase the x-coordinate. But the descriptions are relative. This might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to move the `baba` rule to the right, so that the Baba entity is positioned there, allowing me to move towards the key. Let's see: moving the `baba` rule one step to the right would place it at 3 left and 2 down. From there, I can move right again towards the key.

But how do I move the `baba` rule? I need to be adjacent to it and push it in a direction, provided there's no STOP rule blocking. Since there's no STOP nearby, I can try moving it right. So the action would be ""right"" to move the `baba` rule right, which would then let me control the new Baba position.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `key` to be next to the door, but the rule says ""key is win"", so moving the key might not change that. The key's position is fixed unless I can move it. But the key is an object, and unless there's a rule allowing it to be moved, it's probably a STOP object. Let me check the active rules. There's no rule defining key as movable, except ""key is win"", which doesn't make it movable. So the key is likely a STOP object, meaning I can't push it. So I can't move the key; I have to go around it or over it if possible.

Given that, the path to the key is blocked by walls. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. To get there from the current `baba` rule position (4 left, 2 down), I need to go right 8 steps and up 1 step, but there are walls at 5 steps right and various positions. So maybe the only way is to move the `baba` rule to a position where I can navigate around the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the rules to change the stop condition. For example, if I can make a rule that removes the STOP property from a wall, then I could pass through. But that would require moving the `stop` rule or creating a new rule. The current rules are ""key is win"", ""baba is you"", ""is"" rules, and the ""stop"" rule at 1 left and 3 up.

If I can move the `stop` rule, then I could remove the STOP property from a wall. But moving the `stop` rule would require being adjacent to it and pushing it. The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up. From the current `baba` position (4 left, 2 down), that's quite far. Probably not reachable directly.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to reach the key's position, even if it's blocked, by using the fact that I'm Baba (YOU) and can push objects if possible. But the key is likely a STOP object, so I can't push it. The walls are also STOP, so I can't push them either unless there's a rule allowing it.

Wait, the ""baba is you"" rule means that Baba can move, but other STOP objects can't be moved unless their rules are changed. So maybe the solution is to move the `key is win` rule to make the door the win condition again, then go to the door. But how?

Alternatively, maybe by moving the `key` rule, but the key itself is an object, not a rule. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Let me recap the current state:

- Active rules: key is win, baba is you.
- Key is at 4 right, 1 down.
- Door is at 5 right, 2 down.
- Walls block the direct path.
- The `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down.

To reach the key, I need to move right past several walls. But the walls are STOP, so I can't move through them. Therefore, I need to find a way to remove the STOP property from the walls or navigate around them by moving Baba to a position where the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move the `key is win` rule so that the door becomes the win condition again, then go to the door. But how to do that?

The `key is win` rule is at 10 steps right and 4 steps up (from previous observations, but in the current observation, it's at 6 steps right and 4 up). To move that rule, I would need to be adjacent to it and push it. However, the `key is win` rule is part of the text blocks, and unless there's a STOP rule blocking, I can move it. But in the current observation, the `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up, which is not near the `key is win` rule. So maybe I can move the `key is win` rule to change the win condition to the door.

If I move the `key is win` rule to say `door is win`, then I could go to the door. But how to rephrase that rule? I would need to move the `is` rule that connects key to win. Let's see: the `is` rules are at various positions. For example, there's a rule `is` at 9 steps right and 4 up (part of ""key is win""), and another `is` at 2 steps right (part of ""baba is you"").

To change ""key is win"" to ""door is win"", I need to move the `win` part from key to door. So, take the `win` text block that's connected to key and attach it to door. This would require moving the `win` rule from its current position (next to key) to next to door.

In the current observation, the `win` rule is at 6 steps right and 4 step up, adjacent to the `key` rule. So if I can move the `win` rule from the key to the door, that would change the rule to ""door is win"". To do that, I need to move the `win` rule from its current position (next to key) to next to door.

The door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. So the `win` rule would need to be placed adjacent to the door. To move the `win` rule, I have to be adjacent to it and push it. The `win` rule is at 6 right, 4 up. From the current `baba` position (4 left, 2 down), that's quite a distance. It might not be reachable directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the `is` rule that connects key to win. The `is` rule is at 5 steps right and 4 up. If I can move that `is` rule, then I can reattach the `win` rule to door. But moving the `is` rule would require being adjacent to it. Again, the position is far from the current `baba` rule.

This seems complicated. Maybe the faster way is to try to move the `baba` rule to a position where I can then move towards the key, avoiding the walls.

Current `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down. If I move it right once, to 3 left, 2 down, then I can control Baba there. From there, maybe move right again. But there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 step up, which might not be a problem if I'm moving in a different direction.

Wait, the walls are at various positions. For example, wall 5 steps right and 4 step up is part of the upper structure. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. So moving right from the new `baba` position (3 left, 2 down) would require going right past the wall at 5 steps right, but that's further right. Maybe the path is blocked by walls at 4 steps right and lower positions.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to push a wall if I'm adjacent. But since walls are STOP, I can't push them unless there's a rule allowing it. But there's no such rule here.

Another thought: since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to reach the key's tile, even if it's blocked, by using the ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"" rules. But how? If the key is a STOP object, I can't move it or push through it.

Wait, in Baba Is You, if you're a YOU object and the WIN object is nearby, you win just by standing on it. So if I can get to the key's position, even if it's blocked, maybe that's sufficient. But if there's a wall in the way, I can't get there.

Looking at the current key position: 4 right, 1 down. Are there any paths leading there? Let's map it out.

From the `baba` rule's new position after moving right once (3 left, 2 down), moving right would take me to 2 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 left, 2 down. Then right to 0, 2 down (assuming left is negative x). But there's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, which is not in the way. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. So from 0, 2 down, moving right four steps would get to 4 right, 2 down, but the key is at 4 right, 1 down, which is below. There's a wall at 4 steps right and 1 step up, but that's above. So maybe the path down to 4 right, 1 down is blocked by a wall at 4 right and 2 down (part of the wall structure). Let me check the objects:

There's a wall at 4 steps right and 2 step down. So if I'm at 4 right, 2 down, that's a wall. So I can't go down from there. The key is at 4 right, 1 down, which is below that wall. So there's a wall blocking the path to the key.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to change the rules to remove the STOP property from the wall. How?

The `stop` rule is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move that `stop` rule, then the walls it's affecting would no longer be STOP. But moving the `stop` rule requires being adjacent to it. The current `baba` rule is at 4 left, 2 down, which is quite far from the `stop` rule at 1 left, 3 up. It would take multiple moves to get there, and along the way, there are walls blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes a wall not stop. For example, ""wall is not stop"", but that would require existing text blocks for ""not"" and ""stop"". However, the available text blocks in the current observation include ""is"", ""win"", ""key"", ""baba"", ""you"", ""stop"", and others. There's no ""not"" text block, so I can't create that rule.

Another idea: since ""baba is you"", maybe I can push a wall if I'm adjacent. But walls are STOP, so I can't push them. Unless there's a rule that allows pushing, but there isn't.

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move the `key is win` rule to `door is win`, then go to the door. Let's see how that would work.

The `key is win` rule consists of the ""key"" text block, an ""is"" text block, and a ""win"" text block. To change it to ""door is win"", I need to replace ""key"" with ""door"" in the rule.","

I need to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, to win, I need to get the key because the key is set as the win condition. But how do I get there?

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. The key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there are walls everywhere. The walls are probably blocking my path. The rule ""key is win"" means that if I can reach the key, it becomes the win object, but since the key is already the win, maybe that's not the issue. Alternatively, maybe I need to move the door or change the rules to pass through walls.

Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move. But the walls are marked as ""stop"", which means I can't move through them. So the challenge is to either move the walls away, change their property, or find a way to bypass them using the rules.

Let me see the objects again. There are several rules on the map. For example, ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"", ""rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"", and ""rule `you` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down"". These might be parts of a rule like ""baba is you"", which is already active. Maybe I can manipulate these rules to create a new rule that allows me to move over the walls.

Wait, the ""stop"" property is making the walls immovable. If I can change ""stop"" to something else, like ""push"" or remove it, then the walls might become movable or disappear. But how? To do that, I need to move the text blocks that form the ""stop"" rule.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". So the text blocks for ""stop"" are located there. If I can move those blocks, I can alter the ""stop"" rule. But can I move them? The rule says I can only move objects that aren't defined as ""STOP"" or similar. Since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", and there's no rule saying ""baba is stop"", I should be able to move the text blocks.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule's text blocks to change their meaning. For example, if I can make ""stop"" into something else, like ""win"" or ""push"", then the walls wouldn't block me anymore. Alternatively, I can create a new rule that allows me to move over walls.

But how to do that step by step? Let's see. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. To reach there, I need to go down from my current position. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe I'm at the position of the ""baba"" rule. Let me check the position of Baba. The rule `baba` is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So my current position is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from some reference point. But maybe I need to move towards the key.

Alternatively, maybe I can push the walls. If I can make the walls not ""stop"", then I can move through them. To do that, I need to modify the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" text blocks, maybe I can change them to ""push"" or remove the ""stop"" property.

But how to move the text blocks? I need to be next to them and move them in a direction. Let's see. The ""stop"" rule is composed of three text blocks: ""stop"", ""is"", and whatever it's attached to. Wait, the rule is ""stop is [something]"". Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". That might be the ""stop is [something]"" rule. But in the current active rules, it's just ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the ""stop"" rule must be part of the original level setup.

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to its text blocks and move them. Let's imagine the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up, with the text blocks ""stop"", ""is"", and maybe another part. If I can grab the ""stop"" text block and move it, I can change the rule.

But my current position is at the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 step left and 2 steps down. From there, where can I move? Let's see the possible directions. Maybe I can move right to reach the ""you"" rule or other text blocks. Alternatively, move down to get closer to the key.

Wait, the door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So if I can get past the wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, I could reach the key. But that wall is a ""stop"", so I can't.

Another idea: Maybe I can use the ""key is win"" rule to turn the door into the win condition. But the door is already there. Alternatively, move the ""key is win"" rule to a different position so that reaching the door becomes the win condition. But the door is at 5 right, 2 down. If I can make ""door is win"", then I just need to reach the door. But how to move the ""key is win"" rule?

The ""key is win"" rule is at 9 steps right and 4 step up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to its text blocks. If I can get to that position, I can move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks to change the rule. But moving there might be blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule that makes ""baba"" able to move over stops. For example, ""baba is push"" or ""baba is move"". To do that, I need to create a new rule by placing ""baba"", ""is"", and another property next to each other.

Looking at the current objects, there are some extra ""is"" and ""you"" rules scattered around. For instance, there's a ""rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"". If I can move the ""baba"" rule's text blocks (which are at 4 step left and 2 steps down) and combine them with an ""is"" and a new property like ""push"", that could create the desired rule.

So the steps might be:

1. Move the ""baba"" text blocks to a new location.
2. Combine them with an ""is"" and ""push"" to create ""baba is push"".
3. Then, I can push the walls or move through them.

But where is the ""push"" text block? Looking at the objects, I don't see a ""push"" rule. The available rules are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""stop"", ""baba"", ""you"". So I need to use existing text blocks. Maybe there's a way to repurpose another rule.

Alternatively, if I can make the walls not ""stop"" by changing the ""stop"" rule. For example, moving the ""stop"" text block to a different position so that the rule becomes ""stop is nothing"" or changes to another property.

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. If I can move the ""stop"" block to, say, next to a ""key"" block, making ""key is stop"", then the key would be stop, which might block movement, but that's probably not helpful. Alternatively, moving the ""is"" in the ""stop"" rule to another position.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize the map based on the observations.

Assuming the reference point is Baba's position, which is at 4 step left and 2 steps down from the top-left corner (or some other point). The walls are spread out vertically and horizontally. The key is below to the right, behind a wall. The door is further right and down.

To reach the key, I need to go down two steps from my current position (since the key is at 1 step down), but there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So moving down directly would hit the wall.

Another approach: Maybe push the wall. If walls can be pushed, then I could move them out of the way. But the rule says ""stop"", which usually means you can't push them. Unless I change the ""stop"" rule.

So, the key is to manipulate the ""stop"" rule. If I can change ""stop"" to ""push"", then the walls would be pushable. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" text block.

The ""stop"" rule is made up of three text blocks: ""stop"", ""is"", and whatever it's modifying. In the current observation, the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. The text blocks are likely arranged as ""stop IS [something]"". If I can move the ""stop"" block to a different position, perhaps next to a different property, I can change the rule.

For example, if I move the ""stop"" block to be next to ""baba"", making ""baba IS stop"", then Baba would become stop, which might block himself, but that's not good. Alternatively, move the ""is"" from the ""stop"" rule to connect with another property.

Alternatively, create a new rule like ""wall is not stop"" by rearranging the text blocks. But that requires having the necessary text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a ""rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down"". Maybe I can use that ""is"" block to create a new rule. If I can move the ""wall"" rule's text block (which is at 1 step left and 1 step up) and combine it with ""is"" and ""not stop"", but I don't have a ""not"" block.

This is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to move towards the key and see if I can find a way around the walls using the available text blocks.

Another idea: The ""key is win"" rule means that if I can get the key, the level is won. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. There's a wall at 1 right, 2 down. If I can move that wall, maybe by making it movable, then I can go around it.

To move the wall, its rule is probably ""wall IS stop"". So if I can change that to ""wall IS push"" or remove the ""stop"", then the wall can be pushed. To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" part of the rule.

The ""wall IS stop"" rule is likely composed of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". If I can separate these blocks, I can change the rule. For example, move the ""stop"" block to another part of the map, making the rule ""wall IS [nothing]"", which would remove the ""stop"" property.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""stop"" text block from the ""wall IS stop"" rule to another location.
2. This would change the wall's property to not stop, allowing me to push it or move through it.
3. Then, move around the wall to reach the key.

But how to do this? I need to be adjacent to the ""stop"" block and move it. Let's see where the ""stop"" block is located. It's at 1 step left and 3 step up from the current reference point (Baba's position at 4 left, 2 down). Moving from Baba's position, which is 4 left and 2 down, to 1 left and 3 up would require moving up and left. But is that possible?

Baba's current position is at the rule `baba` located at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So to get to the ""stop"" block at 1 left and 3 up, I need to move up 3 steps and left 1 step. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 5 steps right and 4 step up, which is probably blocking the upper path. This might make it difficult to reach the ""stop"" block.

Alternative approach: Use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a new rule that allows movement over stops. For example, if I can create ""baba is push"", then I can push walls. To do that, I need to find the ""baba"" text block, an ""is"" block, and a ""push"" block. But there's no ""push"" block on the map. The available text blocks are ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""stop"", ""baba"", ""you"".

Wait, maybe ""push"" can be formed by rearranging other blocks. Not sure. Alternatively, create ""baba is move"" using existing blocks. But again, no ""move"" block.

Another possibility: The ""you"" rule. Since ""baba is you"", maybe combining ""you"" with another property. For example, ""you is win"", but that wouldn't help.

Alternatively, change the ""key is win"" to ""door is win"" so that reaching the door becomes the objective. The door is at 5 right, 2 down. If I can move the ""key is win"" rule to say ""door is win"", then I just need to reach the door, which might be easier.

The ""key is win"" rule is at 9 right and 4 up. To move that rule, I need to grab the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" blocks and rearrange them. Let's see: If I move the ""win"" block to the door's location, that could work. But the door is at 5 right, 2 down. The ""win"" block is currently at 9 right, 4 up. Moving it down and left would require moving through walls, which I can't do if they're stop.

This seems challenging. Maybe the solution is to move the ""baba"" text blocks to create a new rule that overrides the ""stop"" property. For example, ""baba is not stop"". But how to form that rule.

If there's an ""is not"" rule somewhere, but I don't think so. The available text blocks are ""is"" and others. Maybe using ""is"" twice? Like ""baba is is stop"", but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, use the existing ""is"" blocks to create a new rule. For example, take the ""baba"" block, move it to a new position, then add an ""is"" and a ""push"" (even if I don't have a push block, maybe it's formed by combining others). Not sure.

Wait, the game allows creating new rules by placing text blocks adjacent to each other. So if I can move the ""baba"" block next to an ""is"" and a ""push"" block, it would create ""baba is push"". But I don't have a ""push"" block. The available blocks are ""key"", ""win"", ""stop"", ""is"", ""baba"", ""you"". So unless ""push"" can be formed by combining other blocks, which I don't think so, this might not be possible.

Another angle: The key is the win object. If I can reach the key, the level ends. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. There's a wall at 1 right, 2 down. If I can make that wall not a stop, I can go around it. To do that, I need to change the ""wall is stop"" rule.

The ""wall is stop"" rule is likely made up of the text blocks ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"". If I can remove the ""stop"" block from this rule, the wall would no longer be stop. So moving the ""stop"" block to another part of the map.

The ""stop"" block is at 1 left and 3 up. If I can move it to, say, next to the ""key"" block, making ""key is stop"", then the key would be stop, which blocks movement. That's not helpful. Alternatively, move the ""stop"" block far away so the rule ""wall is stop"" is broken.

But how to move the ""stop"" block. Let's assume I'm at Baba's position (4 left, 2 down). To reach the ""stop"" block at 1 left, 3 up, I need to move up 3 and left 1. But the path might be blocked. Looking at the walls, there's a wall at 5 right and 4 up, which is probably above the current area. Maybe the path is clear.

From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving up one step would take me to 4 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? According to the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step up. Wait, the walls are at various positions. This is getting confusing without a visual map.

Alternatively, think of the grid based on the observations. Let's assume the reference point is the top-left corner. Each step right or left increases or decreases the x-coordinate, and up or down increases or decreases the y-coordinate.

Baba's position is at the rule `baba` located at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So his coordinates might be (0,0), and the ""baba"" rule is at (-4, -2). The ""wall"" at 1 step left and 1 step up would be at (-5, -1). The ""key"" is at (4, -1), and the door at (5, -2).

The ""stop"" rule is at (-1, -3). To reach there from Baba's position (-4, -2), I need to move right 3 and up 1. But there's a wall at (-5, -1), which is left and up from Baba. Not sure if that blocks the path.

This is quite complex. Maybe the best move is to try to reach the key by moving down and right, avoiding the walls. But the walls are in the way. Alternatively, use the existing rules to create a new rule that allows movement over stops.

Wait, another idea: If I can make ""baba"" equivalent to ""win"", then touching the key (which is win) would make Baba win. But the rule is ""key is win"", so if I can make ""baba is win"", then touching anything would win, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, create ""baba is key"", then touching the key would make Baba key","

Let's try to figure out what to do next. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means I need to get the key to become the win condition, or maybe find a way to make myself the win. But ""baba is you"" makes me have control over the Baba object, so I can move around using that.

Looking at the objects on the map, the door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. That's probably the exit. But how do I get there? The door is likely behind some walls or stop rules. There's a rule ""stop"" at 1 step to the left and 3 steps up, which might make certain objects immovable.

The key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. If I pick up the key, since ""key is win"", that might change the win condition. But to pick it up, I need to be next to it. The current position of Baba (the player) is at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So I'm there. To get to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step down, I need to move right twice and down once. But moving right would take me to the wall at 1 step to the right (wall 1 step to the right). Wait, the wall is at 1 step to the right from where? Let me check the map details again.

The objects list includes several walls. For example, wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up, wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up, etc. But the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. My current position is rule `baba` at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So to move right, I need to check if there's a wall blocking the path.

Looking at the walls near that area: wall 1 step to the right is mentioned in multiple positions, but the key is at 4 steps right,1 step down. So from the baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right once would take me to 3 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at various positions, but not specifically at 3 left. Wait, the walls are all on the right side. The first wall mentioned is 4 steps to the left and 4 step up, which is probably far away. The closer walls are at 1 step to the right in different ups and downs.

Wait, maybe the layout is such that the player is on the left side, and the walls are forming a path. Let me visualize:

Baba is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. To reach the key at 4 steps right and 1 step down, the path would be:

Move right once: 3 step left, 2 down. Is there a wall here? The walls listed are at 1 step to the right in various positions. Maybe not. Then move right again to 2 step left, 2 down. Still no wall mentioned. Then right again to 1 step left, 2 down. Then right to the center (0 steps left/right?), but the key is at 4 steps right. Wait, perhaps the coordinate system is relative. Maybe the player starts at a certain point, and objects are placed in relative steps.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to the right and below the player. So moving right, right, right, down. But I need to check for obstacles. The walls mentioned are at 1 step to the right and various ups, so not in the downward path. The wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down might be blocking. Let me check the objects again:

Objects include wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So from the player's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right once would take to 3 left, 2 down. Then right again to 2 left, 2 down. Then right to 1 left, 2 down. Then right to 0 (center), 2 down. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, which would be at 3 left, 2 down if the player is at 4 left. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the player's position. This is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the player needs to move towards the key, avoiding walls. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. The door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. So the key is one step left of the door. If I pick up the key, since ""key is win"", that would make the key the win object. Then I need to bring the key to the door? Or maybe the door is the win condition, but it's behind walls.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", so the goal is to reach the key, because it's defined as win. But the key is at 4R,1D. The player is at 4L,2D. So moving right three times and down once. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So if the player is at 4L,2D, moving right once would be 3L,2D. No wall there. Right again to 2L,2D. No wall. Right to 1L,2D. Then right to 0 (center),2D. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, which would be at 3L,2D if the player is at 4L. Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move right past the walls by rearranging rules. Since ""baba is you"", I can move text blocks. The key is a rule 'key' at 4R,4U. To pick up the key, I need to move it, but it's a rule. So maybe I need to change the rule 'key is win' to 'baba is win', making myself the win condition. That way, I can just reach any exit, including the door.

To do that, I need to find the text blocks that make up 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. The 'key is win' rule is at 7R,4U (rule 'key'), 8R,4U ('is'), 9R,4U ('win'). The 'baba is you' rule is at 1L,5D (rule 'baba'), 5D ('is'), 1R,5D ('you'). 

If I can move the 'baba' rule to associate with 'win', I could make 'baba is win'. For example, move the 'baba' text block next to 'win' and 'is'. But I need to check if those text blocks are movable. The 'stop' rule is at 2 steps right and 3 steps up, which might prevent moving certain objects.

Alternatively, since I'm Baba and can move, I can push objects that aren't stopped. The 'stop' rule applies to objects defined as stop, like walls. So maybe I can move the 'is' and 'you' text blocks to rearrange the rules.

The goal is to make 'baba is win'. So I need to take the 'baba' text block and place it next to 'win' and 'is'. The current 'baba' rule is at 1L,5D. The 'win' rule is at 9R,4U. That's quite far. Maybe it's easier to move the 'win' to be next to 'baba' and 'is'.

But how to do that? Let's see. The 'win' is at 9R,4U. The 'is' is at 8R,4U. The 'key' is at 7R,4U. So the 'key is win' rule is horizontal. To make 'baba is win', I need to take the 'baba' text block (at 1L,5D) and place it next to 'win' and 'is'. 

The steps could be: move down to reach the 'baba' text block, then move right or left to position it next to 'is' and 'win'. But the 'baba' rule is at 1L,5D. The current player position is at the 'baba' rule's location, I think. So to pick up the 'baba' text block, I need to move it. Since 'baba is you', I can move it. 

So the plan is: move the 'baba' text block to be adjacent to 'is' and 'win' to form 'baba is win'. Then, since I'm Baba and the rule is 'baba is win', reaching any win object (like the door) would complete the level.

To do this, I need to navigate to the 'baba' rule, then move it. Let's check the current position of the player. The 'baba' rule is at 1 step to the left and 5 steps down. So the player is there. If I move down from there, I would be at 1L,6D. Are there any walls there? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 5R,6D (door's position is 9R,2D). Not sure. Alternatively, move right from the 'baba' position to get to the 'is' and 'win' rules. 

The 'is' is at 5D (same vertical as baba's rule?), no. The 'is' in the 'key is win' rule is at 8R,4U. That's up and to the right. The player is at 1L,5D. To reach 8R,4U, that's a lot of movement. Maybe it's easier to move the 'win' to the 'baba' and 'is'.

Alternatively, find the 'you' rule at 1R,5D. If I can move the 'you' to 'win', but that might not help. 

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe just go get the key. The key is at 4R,1D from the player's current position (assuming player is at 0,0). So move right three times and down once. But need to check for walls. The wall at 1R,2D is mentioned, which would be in the path if moving right. Let's say the player is at 4L,2D. Moving right once to 3L,2D (no wall), right to 2L,2D (no wall), right to 1L,2D (no wall), right to 0,2D (no wall). Then down to 0,3D. Then right to 1R,3D. Then down to 1R,4D. Then right to 4R,4D (key's position is 4R,4U?), wait, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up. That's conflicting with the player's position. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the starting point, which is unclear.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe the best bet is to try moving towards the key and see if I can pick it up. If I can't due to walls, then try rearranging the rules. Given the previous failed actions, maybe the issue is that the path is blocked by a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So from the player's position (4L,2D), moving right four times would get to the key's horizontal position (since key is 4R), but vertically it's 1D. 

Wait, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. So from the player's position (4L,2D), moving right four times would get to 0 (center),2D, then right to 1R,2D, then 2R,2D, 3R,2D, 4R,2D. Then down once to 4R,3D, then down again to 4R,4D (key's position is 4R,4U?), this is not matching. I'm getting mixed up with the coordinate system.

Alternative idea: the key is in the upper part of the map since its Y coordinate is higher (4U). The player is at 5D. So to reach the key, need to move up and right. But there are walls blocking the way. The 'stop' rule is at 2R,3U, which might make certain areas impassable.

Given the time I've spent and previous failures, perhaps the correct action is to move right towards the key, avoiding walls. If the previous actions were failing, maybe the path isn't clear. Alternatively, try moving the 'is' and 'win' text blocks to associate with 'baba'.

For example, the current 'baba is you' is at 1L,5D; 2L,5D ('is'); 1R,5D ('you'). To make 'baba is win', I need to replace 'you' with 'win'. So move the 'you' block away and place 'win' next to 'baba' and 'is'.

The 'win' block is at 9R,4U. That's far away. Maybe it's not feasible. Alternatively, take the 'win' block and move it down to the player's level. But moving it requires that it's not stopped. The 'stop' rule is at 2R,3U, which might not affect the 'win' block since it's not labeled as stop.

Alternatively, use the 'key is win' rule. Since the key is win, if I can get the key and then bring it to the door, but the door is a 'door' object. Not sure.

Another angle: the door is at 5R,2D. If I can change the rule to 'door is win', then reaching the door would work. But how? To do that, I need to find the 'door' object and create a rule 'door is win'. The 'door' is an object, not a text block, so I can't directly create a rule about it unless I have the necessary text blocks.

The available text blocks are 'baba', 'is', 'key', 'stop', 'win', 'you'. So to make 'door is win', I need to place 'door' next to 'is' and 'win'. But 'door' is an object, not a text block. In Baba Is You, you can push objects (like doors) if they aren't stopped. So maybe push the door to a position where the text blocks 'is' and 'win' are adjacent.

But the door is at 5R,2D. The 'win' text block is at 9R,4U. That's a long way. Alternatively, move the 'win' block down to near the door. But moving it requires being able to push it past any stop rules.

The 'stop' rule is at 2R,3U. So if I move the 'win' block down from 4U to 2D, would that be possible? The path might be blocked by walls. For example, moving down from 4U to 3U, then 2U, then 1U, then 0, then 1D, 2D. But there's a wall at 5R,2D (the door's position), but the door is an object, not a wall. Wait, the wall is at 1R,2D according to the objects list. So from 4U, moving down each step:

4U -> 3U: no wall mentioned.

3U -> 2U: no wall.

2U -> 1U: no wall.

1U -> 0: no wall.

0 -> 1D: no wall.

1D -> 2D: there's a wall at 1R,2D. So if the 'win' block is at 2R,4U, moving down to 2R,3U (no wall), then to 2R,2U (no wall), then to 2R,1U, then 2R,0, then 2R,1D, then 2R,2D. But at 2R,2D, there's a wall. So the 'win' block can't move past that.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to move the 'key' to be the 'win' by rearranging the text blocks. Since 'key is win', if I can make 'baba is win', then I can win by reaching Baba (myself). So the steps would be:

1. Move the 'baba' text block to be next to 'is' and 'win'.

The 'baba' text block is at 1L,5D. The 'is' is at 3L,2D (assuming positions relative). To get 'baba' next to 'is' and 'win', need to move it right and up.

Alternatively, the 'is' in 'baba is you' is at 2L,5D. The 'you' is at 1R,5D. To change it to 'baba is win', need to replace 'you' with 'win'. So move the 'you' block away and bring the 'win' block next to 'is' and 'baba'.

But the 'win' block is at 9R,4U. That's far. Maybe it's easier to move the 'key is win' rule to 'baba is win'.

Alternatively, since the key is win, maybe just go grab the key and then the win condition is satisfied wherever I am. So the goal is to reach the key. The key is at 4R,4U. From the player's position at 4L,5D, the path would be:

Move right four times to 0,5D.

Then up four times to 0,1D (since 5D -4U =1D).

But that would reach 4R,1D, which is the key's position. But there's a wall at 1R,2D. So moving right from 4L,5D:

First right to 3L,5D (no wall).

Then right to 2L,5D (no wall).

Right to 1L,5D (no wall).

Right to 0,5D (no wall).

Then up once to 0,4D.

Up again to 0,3D.

Up to 0,2D.

Up to 0,1D (key's position).

52,right,"<reasoning>
The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means the key becomes the win condition, and I'm controlling Baba since ""baba is you"". Now, looking at the objects on the map, the door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So the key is one step above the door.

The walls are spread out. Let me visualize the grid. The player (Baba) is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So to move towards the key, I need to go right. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, but the movement might be blocked by STOP rules. Let me check the walls and their positions.

The walls are 5 steps to the right in various positions, but the immediate obstacle seems to be the wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. However, since ""baba is you"", but there's no ""stop"" rule attached to Baba. Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's a ""stop"" rule at 1 step left and 3 step up, but that's not directly in the path. 

Wait, moving right from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) would take me to 3 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So moving right once would be to 3 left, 2 down, which is not a wall. Then moving right again to 2 left, 2 down. Then again to 1 left, 2 down. Then to the center (0 left/right?), but there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe the walls are positioned such that moving right past Baba's position is blocked. Let me recheck the objects.

Looking at the objects: wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So if Baba is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, moving right once would take him to 3 steps left, 2 steps down. Then next step right to 2 steps left, same y. Then another right to 1 step left, 2 steps down. Then the next step right would be to the center (0 left/right), but there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing. Let me try to map it.

Assuming Baba's position is the starting point. The walls are positioned relative to him. For example, ""wall 4 step to the left and 4 step up"" would be 4 left, 4 up from Baba. Similarly, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So the key is to the right and slightly below Baba. The door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down, which is further right and down from the key.

So the path from Baba to the key is right, right, right, down? But need to avoid walls. The walls at 1 step right and 2 steps down would block movement down from there. Wait, but the key is at 4 right, 1 down. So maybe moving right three times (from 4 left to 4 right) would get to the key's x-coordinate, then down once. But need to check if there are walls along the way.

Looking at the objects again: wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So if I'm moving right from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right once to 3 left, 2 down. No wall there. Then right again to 2 left, 2 down. Still no wall. Then right to 1 left, 2 down. Then right again to 0 left (center), but there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which is the same as 0 left, 2 down. So that's a wall. So I can't go past that. Wait, that wall is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from Baba. So from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right once gets to 3 left, 2 down. Then right again to 2 left, 2 down. Then right again to 1 left, 2 down. That's one step left from the center. The wall is at 1 step right (which would be 0 left from Baba's original position), so that's the same as 1 left from Baba's current position. So yes, moving right three times would reach the wall at 1 step right (which is 0 left from original), but wait, maybe the coordinate system is absolute. This is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the key is at 4 steps right from the starting point, so if I move right four times, I reach the key. But along the way, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So when moving right, after a few steps, I encounter that wall. Let me list the positions step by step:

Baba's position: let's assume he's at (0,0) for simplicity.

- ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 4 step up"" would be at (-4, 4)
- ""wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up"" at (1,4)
- ""rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" at (4,4)
- ... and so on.

The key is at (4,4), which is up and to the right. But the active rule says ""key is win"", so grabbing the key would make it the win condition. But the door is at (5,2), which is to the right and down from the key.

Wait, maybe the initial position of Baba is somewhere else. The observation mentions ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"", which probably means the Baba text block is at (-4, -2) if Baba is at (0,0). But the player is Baba, so maybe the player's position is where the ""baba"" text block is located. Let me clarify.

In Baba Is You, the player is the object that has the ""YOU"" property. Currently, the active rules are ""baba is you"", so the Baba text block is the one you control. The Baba text block is at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down from some reference point. Wait, the observation says ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"". So that rule is positioned at that location, but the actual Baba entity is the one that has the ""YOU"" property due to the ""baba is you"" rule.

So the player (Baba) is likely at the position of the ""baba"" text block, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from wherever the reference is. But perhaps the exact coordinates are less important than the relative positions.

The key is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up from the ""baba"" rule's position. Wait, the ""rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up"" â€” so that's 4 right, 4 up from the ""key"" rule's position. This is getting complex. Maybe it's better to focus on movement directions.

The goal is to reach the key, which is the win condition. So I need to move towards the key. The key's position relative to Baba: if the ""key"" rule is 4 steps right and 4 steps up from its own position, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the key object is located at 4 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position, as per the observation: ""key 4 steps to the right and 1 step down"".

So from Baba's position (where the ""baba"" rule is), moving right 4 steps and down 1 step gets to the key. But the path might be blocked. The walls are at various positions. For example, ""wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down"" from Baba's position would block movement if I try to go that way.

So the plan is: move right towards the key, avoiding walls. Let's see:

1. From Baba's position, move right. The first step right would be to 3 steps left (assuming left is negative), then right again, etc. But need to check for walls.

Looking at the walls listed:

- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
- wall 5 steps to the right in various positions, but those are probably further up.

So the immediate wall when moving right and down is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So if I move right once, then down once, I hit that wall. But the key is at 4 right and 1 down. So maybe I need to move right first, then down after avoiding the wall.

Alternatively, move down first, then right. Let's see:

If I move down from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving down to 4 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls listed are at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which is 3 left, 2 down. Wait, maybe the walls are in different positions. This is getting too confusing with the coordinate system.

Perhaps a better approach is to look for movable text blocks. The ""is"", ""you"", ""win"", ""stop"" rules can be moved to change the game rules. For example, if I can move the ""win"" rule to another object, like the door, then touching the door would win. Alternatively, turning ""key is win"" into ""door is win"" might make the door the target.

But to do that, I need to move the text blocks. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. The door is at 5 right, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is currently at 10 right, 4 up. So to change the win condition to the door, I need to move the ""win"" rule to the door's position. But the door is an object, not a text block. So maybe I need to create a new rule like ""door is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks next to the door.

Alternatively, since ""key is win"", having the key as the win condition means picking up the key wins. So the goal is to reach the key. However, the key is at 4 right, 1 down, and there's a wall at 1 right, 2 down. So the path might be right, right, right, down? Let's see:

- Start at Baba's position (0,0).
- Move right four times to reach the key's x-coordinate (4,0).
- Then move down once to (4,-1), which is the key's position.

But along the way, at (1,0), there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the wall is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from Baba's position, which would be (1,-2). So moving right to (1,0) is safe. Then right to (2,0), (3,0), (4,0). Then down to (4,-1), which is the key. So that path seems possible.

But wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. So (4,-1). If there are no walls between those steps, then this is the way. The only wall mentioned in the path is at (1,-2), which is two steps down from Baba, not on the direct path to the key.

Therefore, the valid actions would be to keep moving right until reaching the key, then down. So the next step is to move right.

Let's see. I need to figure out how to get to the door, which is the win condition right now because the active rule is ""key is win"". Looking at the current observation, the door is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Where is Baba located?

From the objects list, there's a rule `baba` at 5 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So that's Baba's position. The active rules are ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"". So as Baba, I can move around, but I need to get to the door. However, the path might be blocked by walls or other obstacles.

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 4 steps up, which is above the current position. Then walls at 3, 2, 1 step up, so those form a vertical line on the left. Below, there's a wall at 2 steps down. The key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, but the door is to the right and down from Baba's position.

Wait, the door is 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down from Baba's current position. Let me visualize this. If Baba is at 5 left, 2 down, then moving right would decrease the left steps. So 5 left to 4 left is one step right, then to 3 left, etc. The door is at 4 right and 2 down. So from 5 left, 2 down, moving right 4 steps would get to 1 left (since 5 -4 =1 left?), but the door is at 4 right. Maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the position is relative to the player's current location. But maybe I should focus on the relative positions.

The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. But since ""key is win"", maybe grabbing the key would change the win condition, but the current rule is still ""key is win"", so the door is the win object. However, maybe the door is behind walls. Let's check the walls again. There's a wall at 2 steps down, and another wall at 2 steps down and 1 step to the right. So moving down from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down) would take him to 5 left, 3 down, but there's a wall at 2 steps down (maybe that's the same as his current position? Wait, the wall is at 2 steps down, same as Baba's position? Then he can't move down because that's a wall? Or is the wall at 2 steps down from the starting point?

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the positions again.

Baba's position: rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. So his location is 5 steps left and 2 down from the reference point (maybe the top-left corner?). The door is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So from Baba's position, to reach the door, he needs to move right 4 steps and down 0 steps (since both are 2 steps down). Wait, no. If Baba is at 5 left, 2 down, and the door is at 4 right, 2 down, then the horizontal difference is 5 left to 4 right, which is a total of 9 steps to the right. But that's a lot. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, maybe the coordinates are relative. For example, moving right from Baba's position would decrease the left steps. So if he moves right once, he's at 4 left, same down. Then again to 3 left, etc. The door is at 4 right, which would be 5 left minus 9 steps right? That can't be right. Maybe the coordinate system is such that positive directions are to the right and down. So ""5 step to the left"" means 5 steps in the negative x-direction, and ""2 steps down"" is negative y-direction. The door is at 4 steps right (positive x) and 2 steps down (negative y). So from Baba's position (x=-5, y=-2), the door is at (x=4, y=-2). The difference is x=9, y=0. So he needs to move right 9 steps, but there are walls blocking the way.

Looking at the walls: wall at 5 step to the left and 4 step up. That's a wall far to the left and up. Then wall at 4 step up (maybe above the current level). Then walls at 3, 2, 1 step up, forming a vertical line on the left. Below, there's a wall at 2 steps down, which is where Baba is currently (since his position is 2 steps down). So he can't move down further because of that wall. The wall at 2 steps down is at the same level as Baba, so he's blocked from moving down. How about moving right? Let's see the objects. To the right of Baba, there's a key at 3 steps right and 1 step down. But getting to the key might require moving right past walls.

Wait, the walls at 1 step up, 2 step up, etc., are on the left. So moving right from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), he can go right towards the area without walls. The wall at 2 steps down is at the same level as Baba, so he can't move down. To move right, he needs to get past any walls that are in his path. Are there walls to the right? The wall at 2 steps down is directly below him. The other walls are above. So maybe moving right is possible.

Let me think step by step. Current position: Baba at (5 left, 2 down). Door at (4 right, 2 down). So to get to the door, he needs to move right 9 steps (since 5 left to 4 right is a difference of 9 steps right). But there's a wall at 2 steps down, which is where he is, so he can't move down. The walls above are at 1, 2, 3, 4 steps up, but those are on the left. So moving right should be possible, unless there are walls to the right.

Looking at the objects list: after the walls, there's a key at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Then rules and the door. So the path to the right might be clear except for the key's position. But the key is at 3 right, 1 down. From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving right 3 steps would get to 2 left, 2 down. Then down 1 step would reach 2 left, 3 down, but there's a wall at 2 steps down (Baba's current position). Wait, the wall at 2 steps down is blocking movement down. So maybe he needs to move around that.

Alternatively, maybe the key is a distraction. Since the active rule is ""key is win"", maybe picking up the key would change the win condition, but the door is already the win object. However, the key might be necessary to unlock something, but in this case, the rule is already set to ""key is win"", so having the key might not be necessary unless the door is locked. But the door's type is just a door; there's no rule saying ""door is stop"" or something that would require the key.

Wait, the door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. From Baba's position, moving right 4 steps would get him to 1 left (5 -4 =1 left), same y. Then he needs to go to 4 right, which is 5 more steps right. But there's a wall at 2 steps down (his current position), blocking down. So maybe he needs to move up first? But the walls above are at 1, 2, 3, 4 steps up, which are on the left. If he moves up from his current position (5 left, 2 down), he can go up past the walls? For example, moving up one step would be 5 left, 1 down. Is there a wall there? The walls are at 1, 2, 3, 4 steps up, which are on the left side. So moving up from 5 left, 2 down to 5 left, 1 down would be possible if there's no wall there. But the walls listed are at 4 step up, 3 step up, etc., which might be in different x positions.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to map out the grid.

Assuming Baba is at position (x=-5, y=-2) (left and down as negative coordinates).

Doors are at (x=4, y=-2).

Walls are at:

- (x=-4, y=4) [4 step left, 4 step up]

- (x=0, y=4) [4 step right, 4 step up]

- Then walls at y=3: (x=-3, y=3) [3 step left, 3 step up]

- Wall at (x=0, y=3)

- Wall at (x=-2, y=2) [2 step left, 2 step up]

Wait, maybe the coordinates are absolute. The wall at ""4 step to the left and 4 step up"" would be at position (-4,4). Then the next wall is ""wall 4 step up"" which could be at (0,4). Then ""rule `key` 7 steps to the right and 4 step up"" would be at (7,4). So the layout from left to right at y=4 has walls at x=-4, 0, 7, etc.

But this is getting too detailed. Maybe the key is at (3,1), and the door is at (4,2). Baba is at (-5, -2).

To get from (-5,-2) to (4,2), he needs to move right 9 steps and up 4 steps. But there are walls blocking the way. The walls at y=1,2,3,4 up on the left side. So moving up from (-5,-2) would take him towards y=-1,0,1, but there's a wall at y=1 (x=-5? Not sure). Alternatively, maybe the walls are placed such that moving right from Baba's position is possible, but he needs to navigate around them.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move towards the key first, pick it up (but how?), and then use it to reach the door. However, the rule is ""key is win"", so maybe having the key changes something. But the door is already the win object. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: since ""baba is you"", and ""key is win"", maybe the goal is to touch the key, which is considered winning. But the door is also a win condition. However, the active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key would make you win. But the door is also there. Maybe the intended solution is to move to the door, but it's blocked by a wall. Let me check the walls again.

The wall at 2 steps down is at the same y-coordinate as Baba, so he can't move down. To move right, he needs to go around the walls above. For example, moving up one step to y=-1, then right past the walls. But are there walls at y=-1? The walls listed are at y=4,3,2,1,0 (maybe). The wall at 2 steps up is at y=2 (assuming current position is y=-2). So moving up from y=-2 to y=-1, then right. But if there's no wall at y=-1, he could move right.

Alternatively, the wall at 2 steps down (y=-2) is solid, so he can't move down. To move right, he has to go around the walls on the left. Let's see: from Baba's position (-5,-2), if he moves up to y=-1, then right, he can avoid the walls. For example:

1. Move up to (-5, -1)

2. Move right to (-4, -1)

3. Move right to (-3, -1)

4. Continue moving right until he reaches the area without walls.

But are there walls at y=-1? The walls listed are at y=4,3,2,1,0 (maybe). If there are no walls at lower y levels, then this path is possible.

Once past the walls, he can move towards the door. The door is at (4,-2), so from (-5,-2), moving right 9 steps and down 0. But since he can't move down, he needs to stay at y=-2. Wait, but moving right from (-5,-2) to (4,-2) is possible if there are no walls in between.

But there's a wall at 2 steps down (his current position), but that's only at his current x position? Or is it a vertical wall? If the wall at 2 steps down is a single block at (-5,-2), then moving right past it is possible. The other walls are above, so moving right should be clear.

Wait, the wall at 2 steps down is likely a single block at the same x as Baba, blocking movement down. But moving right from there shouldn't be blocked unless there's a wall to the right.

The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down, which would be at (-5 +3, -2 -1) = (-2, -3). But the current rule is ""key is win"", so maybe touching the key would make him win. But the door is also a win condition. However, the active rule is ""key is win"", so the key is the target. Maybe the intended path is to get the key first.

But how to reach the key? The key is at (-2, -3), which is to the right and down from Baba. But he can't move down due to the wall at (-5,-2). So he needs to move around the wall.

Let me outline a possible path:

1. Move up from (-5,-2) to (-5,-1) [since there's no wall mentioned there]

2. Move right to (-4,-1)

3. Continue moving right until x=0, avoiding any walls.

4. Then move down to y=-2, but there's a wall at x=0, y=-2? Not sure.

Alternatively, after reaching x=3 (the key's x position), he can move down to y=-3 to get the key. But the key is at 1 step down from Baba's current position, so moving down once would reach y=-3, but there's a wall at y=-2 (Baba's current position), blocking movement down. So he can't move down from (-5,-2) to (-5,-3) because of the wall at (-5,-2).

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to move right past the wall at x=-5,y=-2 by moving up, then right, then down.

Another approach: since the rule is ""baba is you"", and ""key is win"", perhaps rearranging the rules to make ""door is win"" instead. But to do that, the player needs to move the ""win"" text block to associate with ""door"".

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` 10 steps to the right and 4 step up. So the ""win"" text block is located there. To change the win condition to door, the player needs to bring the ""win"" rule next to ""door"".

But how to move the ""win"" rule? The player (Baba) can move text blocks that are not defined as ""stop"". The current rules don't mark ""is"" or ""win"" as stop, so they can be moved.

So the plan could be:

1. Move to the ""win"" rule's location (10 right, 4 up) to pick it up.

2. Move down and left to the door's position (4 right, 2 down).

3. Place the ""win"" rule next to ""door"" so that ""door is win"" becomes active.

But this requires navigating past walls and moving the text blocks.

However, the key is currently the win condition, so maybe the intended solution is simpler. Perhaps the player needs to move to the key, which is considered winning, but the door is also a win condition. But since the rule is ""key is win"", touching the key would make you win. However, the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down from Baba. To reach it, he needs to move right 3 steps and down 1 step. But he can't move down due to the wall at his current position. So he has to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to move to the door directly, but it's blocked by a wall. Looking at the door's position (4 right, 2 down), and Baba's position (-5,-2). The horizontal distance is 9 steps right. If there's a wall in between, he can't go around. But the walls are all on the left side at higher y positions. So moving right should be possible.

Wait, the wall at 2 steps down is at Baba's current position, but that's a single block. Moving right from there, past x=-5, should be clear. So the path is:

From (-5,-2):

1. Move right to (-4,-2)

2. Right to (-3,-2)

3. Continue right until reaching the door at (4,-2)

But is there a wall blocking this path? The walls listed are on the left at higher y positions. So if there are no walls to the right of x=-5 at y=-2, this path is possible.

Assuming there are no walls in that area, moving right repeatedly would reach the door. Since the active rule is ""key is win"", touching the door would make him win. But the door is at (4,-2), and the key is at (-2,-3). So maybe the intended solution is to move to the door directly.

But why were previous actions failing? The user kept getting ""failed to obtain a valid action"". Maybe the assistant was not specifying the direction correctly. For example, previous answers had ""down"" repeatedly, which might not be the right path.

In the current observation, the door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down from Baba's position. Wait, no. According to the objects list:

door 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down.

Wait, the door's position is rule `door` 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down from Baba's position. So Baba is at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down, and the door is at 5 right and 2 down. So the horizontal difference is 5 left to 5 right, total 10 steps right. But that can","

Let's try to figure out the next move here. The active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So my goal is to get the key, and since key is win, grabbing the key should make me win, right? But how do I get there?

Looking at the objects on the map, I see a door at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But the door is probably only accessible if I'm the WIN object. Since key is WIN, maybe I need to pick up the key first. The key is located at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. There's a wall at 1 step down, but wait, the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Let me check the path.

From my current position (assuming I'm at Baba's position, which is 5 steps left and 2 steps down), I need to move towards the key. Let's see. If I move right, that's towards the key. But there's a wall at 2 steps down. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me map this out.

Current position: rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if I'm positioned there, moving right would take me towards the key. But looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 steps up, but that's probably not in the same row. The walls that could block me are at 1 step down, 2 steps down, etc. Wait, the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So from my position (5 left, 2 down), moving right would decrease the left steps and increase the right steps. Each move right would reduce the left by 1 and add to the right. Wait, maybe the coordinate system is relative. Alternatively, perhaps the position is described as steps in directions. For example, ""wall 1 step down"" is below my current position.

So if I'm at 5 steps left and 2 steps down, moving right would bring me closer to the key. Let's calculate the path. From 5 left, 2 down:

If I move right three times, I'd be at 2 left, 2 down. Then down once to 2 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps down. Wait, the walls are at various positions. Let me check the objects again.

The walls listed are:

- wall 4 step up (probably above the key area)
- wall 4 step up (another one?)
Wait, looking at the objects:

rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 4 step up
wall 4 step up
rule `key` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
wall 3 step up
wall 2 step up
wall 1 step up
wall 1 step down
key 3 steps to the right and 1 step down
rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `is` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `you` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
wall 2 steps down
door 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down

Hmm, the walls are spread out. The key is at 3 right, 1 down. My position is 5 left, 2 down. So to get to the key, I need to move right three times (to 2 left, 2 down), then down once (to 2 left, 3 down). But there's a wall at 2 steps down. Wait, the wall at 2 steps down is at 2 steps down from where? Maybe from my current position. So moving down from 2 down to 3 down would hit a wall. That's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the walls are in specific positions. Let's parse each wall's location:

- wall 4 step up: 4 steps upwards from where?
- wall 4 step up (another one)
- wall 3 step up
- wall 2 step up
- wall 1 step up
- wall 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down

Assuming these are all relative to the player's position, which is at 5 left, 2 down. So:

- wall 4 step up is 4 steps up from player's position.
- wall 1 step down is 1 step below player's position.

So the path to the key (3 right, 1 down) would require moving right three times to get to 2 left, 2 down, then down once to 3 down. But there's a wall at 2 steps down, which is at 2 down from the player's position. So moving down once from 2 down to 3 down would hit that wall. So I can't go straight down.

Alternative route: Maybe move right, then up, then right, then down. Let's see:

From 5 left, 2 down:

Move right to 4 left, 2 down.

Check if that's blocked. Are there any walls there? The walls are at 4 step up, 3 up, etc., but not in this area. So maybe possible.

Then move up to 4 left, 1 down. Is there a wall at 1 down? Yes, there's a wall 1 step down. So moving up from 2 down to 1 down would not hit the wall at 1 step down. Wait, the wall at 1 step down is possibly in a different position. Wait, the walls listed include ""wall 1 step down"", which could be 1 step below the player's current position when they are at 2 down. So moving up to 1 down would avoid that wall.

Wait, maybe the walls are in fixed positions. For example, ""wall 1 step down"" is a permanent wall located one step below the starting point. So if the player moves down, they might hit it. But in this case, the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So maybe the path requires avoiding that wall.

Alternatively, maybe I need to move right, then down around the wall. Let's try:

From 5 left, 2 down:

Move right once: 4 left, 2 down.

Move right again: 3 left, 2 down.

Move right again: 2 left, 2 down (now at the same horizontal position as the key's 3 right, but I'm still two left? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting confusing. Maybe the key is to the right of the player's current position. If the player is at 5 left and 2 down, and the key is at 3 right and 1 down, then moving right three times would bring the player to 2 left (since 5 left minus 3 right = 2 left). Then moving down once to 1 down. But there's a wall at 1 step down, which would block that path.

So perhaps the player needs to find another way. Maybe move right, up, right, down.

From 5 left, 2 down:

1. Move right to 4 left, 2 down.
2. Move up to 4 left, 1 down. Is there a wall here? The walls are at 1 step down (which might be in a different direction), but in this case, moving up from 2 down to 1 down would avoid the wall at 1 step down.
3. Move right to 3 left, 1 down.
4. Move right to 2 left, 1 down.
5. Move down to 2 left, 2 down. But this is the original position. Not helpful.

Alternatively, after step 4 (2 left, 1 down), move down again to 2 left, 2 down, then right to 1 left, 2 down, etc. But this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down from the player's current position. So if the player moves right three times and down once, they reach the key. But the wall at 1 step down (from the player's original position) is at 2 down, so moving down once would hit that wall. Therefore, this path is blocked.

Alternative idea: Maybe move around the wall. Since the wall is at 1 step down (player's position is 2 down), moving right first, then down past the wall.

Wait, perhaps the walls are in specific directions. For instance, a wall 1 step down could be directly below the player's current position. So moving down from 2 down to 3 down would hit that wall. Therefore, to avoid it, the player needs to move in a different direction.

Another approach: Since the key is win, and the door is at 4 steps right and 2 down, perhaps after getting the key, moving to the door would make me WIN, thus opening the door. But how to reach the key.

Alternatively, maybe the player can move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules to change properties. For example, if I can make ""baba"" the WIN, then touching the door would win. But the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". To change this, I need to move the text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there are rule blocks for ""key is win"", ""is"", ""win"", etc. The player (Baba) is at 5 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""you"" rule is at 3 left, 2 down. If I can move these rules to form a new rule like ""baba is win"", that would change the game.

To do that, I would need to pick up the ""is"" and ""you"" rules. But can I move them? The rules are not marked as STOP, except the ""stop"" rule at 2 left, 3 up. So assuming I can move the ""is"" and ""you"" rules, I could create ""baba is win"" by placing them together.

So the plan would be: move to the ""is"" rule at 4 left, 2 down, pick it up, move to ""you"" at 3 left, 2 down, place ""is"" next to ""you"", then move to ""baba"" and place ""is win"" to form ""baba is win"". That way, the win condition changes to Baba, and touching the door or being Baba would make me win.

But how to execute this movement. Let's see the player's position is 5 left, 2 down. To get to the ""is"" rule at 4 left, 2 down, move left once. Then pick up the ""is"" rule. Then move left again to reach the ""you"" rule at 3 left, 2 down. Place the ""is"" next to ""you"" to form ""you is"", which doesn't help. Wait, no. The ""you"" is already there. To create ""baba is win"", I need to connect ""baba"" with ""is win"".

So perhaps after moving the ""is"" and ""you"" rules, I need to position them adjacent to ""baba"" and ""win"".

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule which is at 5 right, 4 up. That's probably too far.

This seems complicated. Maybe the simpler path is to get the key first. But the obstacle is the wall at 1 step down. Maybe there's another way around.

Alternatively, move right, then up, then right, then down. Let's try:

1. Right to 4 left, 2 down.
2. Up to 4 left, 1 down (no wall here? The wall at 1 step down is perhaps in a different location).
3. Right to 3 left, 1 down.
4. Right to 2 left, 1 down.
5. Down to 2 left, 2 down. Now at original position. Not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the player needs to move in a different direction. What about moving up first? From 5 left, 2 down:

1. Up to 5 left, 1 down. Is there a wall here? The walls at 1 step down are possibly not in this direction. The walls listed include ""wall 1 step up"", which would be above. So moving up from 2 down to 1 down is safe.

2. Up again to 5 left, 0 down (but there's a wall at 0 down? Not sure).

Alternatively, moving up to avoid the wall below. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: Since the key is win, and the door is a win if I'm the key. Wait, no. The active rule is ""key is win"", so having the key makes me win. So I need to pick up the key. To do that, navigate past the wall at 1 step down.

Wait, maybe the wall at 1 step down is not in the same row. For example, the player is at 5 left, 2 down. The key is at 3 right, 1 down. So the vertical distance is 1 (from 2 down to 1 down). The horizontal distance is 8 (5 left to 3 right). So moving right 8 times would get to the key, but there's a wall at 1 step down, which is in the same horizontal line as the player's position. So moving down from 2 down to 1 down would hit that wall. Therefore, the path is blocked.

Alternative route: Move around the wall by going up then right then down. For example:

1. Move up from 2 down to 1 down.
2. Move right to avoid the wall.
But if moving up to 1 down, there's a wall there. So that's blocked.

Alternatively, move right first, then up, then right, then down.

From 5 left, 2 down:

1. Move right to 4 left, 2 down.
2. Move up to 4 left, 1 down. (Is there a wall here? The walls listed include ""wall 1 step down"", which might be in a different direction.)
3. Move right to 3 left, 1 down.
4. Move right to 2 left, 1 down.
5. Move down to 2 left, 2 down. Back to start.

Not helpful.

Another approach: Use the ""is"" and ""you"" rules to create a new rule. For example, make ""baba"" the win. To do that, I need to form ""baba is win"". The existing rules are ""key is win"", ""is"", ""you"", etc. If I can move the ""is"" and ""win"" rules next to ""baba"".

The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 4 up. That's quite far. Maybe not feasible.

Alternatively, move the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" and the ""win"" rule. But the player's position is 5 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. So moving left once to get to the ""is"" rule.

Once I have the ""is"" rule, move it to be next to ""baba"" and ""win"". For example:

1. Move left to 4 left, 2 down (grab ""is"").
2. Move left to 3 left, 2 down (now next to ""you"" at 3 left, 2 down).
3. Place ""is"" next to ""you"" to make ""you is"", which doesn't help.
Alternatively, move up with ""is"" to 4 left, 1 down, then right to 5 left (baba's position), place ""is"" next to ""baba"" to make ""baba is"". Then need ""win"" next to that.

The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 4 up. That's a long way. Maybe not practical.

Alternatively, move ""win"" to be next to ""baba is"". But again, distance is an issue.

This seems too complex. Maybe the intended solution is to grab the key by moving around the walls using the rules.

Wait, another idea: Since ""key is win"", if I can reach the key without moving down past the wall, maybe by moving up first.

From 5 left, 2 down:

1. Move up to 5 left, 1 down.
2. Move up to 5 left, 0 down.
3. Move right to 4 left, 0 down.
4. Continue moving right until reaching the key area.

But I'm not sure about the layout. The key is at 3 right, 4 up. So if the player moves up to 0 down, then right 8 times to reach 3 right, 0 down, then up 4 times to the key's position. But there might be walls in the way.

Alternatively, the key is at 3 steps right and 4 steps up from the player's starting position. So moving up 4 times and right 3 times. But the walls at 4 step up and others might block this path.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best bet is to focus on changing the rules to make Baba the WIN. To do that, need to form ""baba is win"".

The components needed are ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"". The ""is"" and ""win"" rules are present. The ""baba"" is a noun. So if I can place ""is"" next to ""baba"" and ""win"" next to that, forming ""baba is win"".

The ""is"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 4 up. The ""baba"" is at 5 left, 2 down.

So the plan is:

1. Move to the ""is"" rule (4 left, 2 down) and pick it up.
2. Move left to 3 left, 2 down (adjacent to ""baba"").
3. Place the ""is"" rule next to ""baba"" to form ""baba is"".
4. Now, need to get the ""win"" rule to be next to ""is"".
5. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right, 4 up. This is a long distance, but perhaps possible by moving up and right.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" rule down and left. But the player might not be able to move it that far.

This seems challenging. Maybe there's a shorter path.

Alternatively, after placing ""baba is"", move the ""win"" rule next to the ""is"" to form ""baba is win"".

But how to transport the ""win"" rule. The player would have to carry it, which requires moving through the map.

Let's try to figure out how to solve this Baba Is You puzzle. The goal here is usually to reach the door or whatever is defined as ""WIN"". Right now, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means touching the key makes you win, or does it? Because the rule says key is win, so maybe whatever object is tagged as win is the target. But in the active rules, it's key is win, so touching the key should make you win. Also, since ""baba is you"", I can control Baba by moving him with the direction commands.

Looking at the objects on the map, I need to locate Baba and the key. From the observation, there's a ""rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down"". That probably means Baba is positioned 5 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the reference point. The key is at ""3 steps to the right and 4 step up"". The door is at ""4 steps to the right and 2 steps down"".

But there are walls blocking the path. For example, there's a wall at 4 step up, 3 step up, 2 step up, 1 step up, and wall 1 step down. Also, some ""stop"" rules which make objects immovable. So I need to find a way around these walls.

Wait, the rules are key is win, so maybe instead of going to the door, I just need to reach the key. Let me check the positions again. The key is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the rule `baba` position. But moving up there might be blocked by walls. Let's map out the positions more clearly.

Assuming the reference point is where the rules are initially placed, but Baba is 5 steps left and 2 steps down from that. The key is at 3 right, 4 up from the rule `baba` position. So from Baba's position, to get to the key, I need to move right and up, but there's a wall at 4 step up, which might be blocking the path. Let me visualize the grid.

Maybe I can push a wall or rearrange the rules. Since the rules are text blocks that can be moved if they're not ""STOP"". The current rules are key is win, which is a text block that can be moved. Also, there are other rules like ""is"" and ""you"" that can be moved. So perhaps I can change the rules to create a path.

For example, if I can change ""key is win"" to something else, like ""baba is win"", then touching Baba himself would make me win, which is obviously possible. But how to do that? I need to move the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" to form a new rule, like ""baba is win"". 

Looking at the objects, the ""win"" rule is at 5 steps to the right and 4 step up. The ""is"" is at 4 steps to the right and 4 step up. The ""key"" is at 3 steps to the right and 4 step up. So if I can move these three text blocks to form ""baba is win"", that would solve the problem. But how to reach them?

Baba's current position is 5 steps left and 2 steps down from the rule `baba` position. Wait, the rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe Baba is at that position. Let me confirm: the rule `baba` is a text block that says ""BABA IS YOU"", so that's the rule defining Baba as the player. Baba's actual position is where the ""BABA"" object is, which is probably at the position of the rule `baba` text block. So if the rule `baba` is at 5 step left and 2 down, then Baba is there.

To move the text blocks, I need to move them adjacent to Baba, since he's the player. But the problem is that some objects are STOP, which are immovable. The walls are STOP, so I can't move them. But the rules like ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", ""baba"", ""you"" can be moved unless they're part of a STOP rule. 

Looking at the active rules, ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. So the wall at that position is STOP, meaning it can't be moved. Other walls might also be STOP. So I need to find a path to the text blocks without hitting STOP walls.

From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), let's see the positions of the text blocks:

- ""key"" is 3 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the rule `baba` position. So relative to Baba's position, that would be 3 right + 5 left = 2 left? Wait, maybe I need to calculate this differently. If the rule `baba` is at 5 left and 2 down, then the key is 3 steps to the right from that point. So Baba is at (5 left, 2 down). The key is at 3 right from rule `baba`, which would be 5 left + 3 right = 2 left from Baba's position. And 4 up from rule `baba` which is 2 down, so 4 up + 2 down = 2 up from Baba's position. So key is 2 left and 2 up from Baba.

Similarly, the ""is"" text block is 4 steps to the right and 4 up from rule `baba`, so that's 5 left +4 right =1 left, and 4 up +2 down=2 up. So ""is"" is 1 left and 2 up from Baba.

The ""win"" text block is 5 steps right and 4 up from rule `baba`, so 5 left +5 right=0 (same x as Baba's position?), and 4 up +2 down=2 up. So ""win"" is directly 2 up from Baba.

The ""you"" text block is at 2 step right and 2 steps down from rule `baba`, so 5 left +2 right=3 left, 2 down +2 down=4 down. So ""you"" is 3 left and 4 down from Baba.

The door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down from rule `baba`, so 5 left +4 right=1 left, 2 down +2 down=4 down. So door is 1 left and 4 down from Baba.

Now, the walls are at various positions. For example, wall at 4 step up, which is 4 up from rule `baba`, so 4 up +2 down=2 up from Baba. So that's a wall 2 up from Baba. Similarly, walls at 3 step up, 2 up, 1 up, and 1 step down.

So the path from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down) to the key (2 left, 2 up) is blocked by a wall at 2 up. So I can't go straight up. Maybe I need to move the wall or rearrange the rules to create a new path.

Alternatively, maybe I can change the rule ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks next to each other to form ""baba is win"". But how to reach them?

Baba's position is at the rule `baba`, which is 5 left, 2 down. Let's see the positions of the text blocks relative to him:

- ""key"": 2 left, 2 up
- ""is"": 1 left, 2 up
- ""win"": same x as Baba, 2 up
- ""you"": 3 left, 4 down
- ""door"": 1 left, 4 down

So the ""win"" is directly above Baba. The ""is"" is to the left and up. The ""key"" is further left and up. The ""you"" is to the left and down.

If I can move down to the ""you"" text block, maybe? But the door is below, but it's at 1 left, 4 down. There's a wall at 1 step down, which is 1 down from rule `baba`, so 2 down +1 down=3 down from Baba? Not sure. Maybe I need to check the wall positions again.

From the observation, the walls are at:

- 4 step up: 4 up from rule `baba`, which is 2 up from Baba
- 3 step up: 3 up from rule `baba`, which is 1 up from Baba
- 2 step up: 2 up from Baba
- 1 step up: 1 up from Baba
- 1 step down: 1 down from Baba

So walls are blocking the upper path. To get to the text blocks above, I need to move around them. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I can push a wall out of the way by moving it, but since walls are STOP, I can't move them. So that's not possible.

Another approach: since the key is the win condition, maybe I just need to reach the key. But the path is blocked. So perhaps I can move the key to a different position using the rules. Wait, but the key is a object defined by the rule ""key is win"". If I move the ""key"" text block, does that change where the key is?

In Baba Is You, when you move a text block that's part of a rule, it changes the rule. For example, if the rule is ""key IS WIN"", and you move the ""key"" to another position, the new rule would be whatever the text blocks are arranged as. So maybe I can move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" to form a new rule that allows passage.

Let me think: If I can create a rule like ""baba is win"", then touching Baba would make me win. Since Baba is the player, that would be easy. To do that, I need to move the ""win"" text block next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

Baba's current position is where the ""baba"" rule is, which is 5 left, 2 down. The ""win"" text block is 2 up from Baba. The ""is"" is 1 left and 2 up. The ""key"" is 2 left and 2 up.

So if I can move the ""win"" text block down to be near Baba, and arrange ""is"" and ""baba"" next to it, that could form ""baba is win"".

But how to move those text blocks? Since they aren't STOP, I should be able to move them as long as I can reach them.

From Baba's position, the ""win"" text block is directly above him at 2 up. If I move up twice, I can reach it. But there's a wall at 2 up, which is part of the STOP wall. So I can't go past that.

Wait, the walls are STOP, meaning I can't move through them or push them. So I'm blocked by the wall at 2 up. Hmm.

Alternative idea: Maybe rearrange the existing rules to create a new path. For example, if I can create a rule like ""floor IS NOT STOP"", then the walls wouldn't block me. But I don't have a ""not"" text block here. The available rules are key, is, win, you, stop, etc.

Alternatively, create a rule that turns the walls into passable objects. For example, ""wall IS STOP"" is already there, but maybe changing it. Wait, the existing rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""is"" and ""stop"" are part of other rules.

Wait, in the objects list, there are multiple ""is"" and ""stop"" rules scattered around. For example, there's a rule `is` at 3 step to the left and 3 step up, and another at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So maybe I can use those.

To create a new rule, I need to have three text blocks: subject, ""IS"", property. For example, to make ""baba is win"", I need the ""baba"" text block, ""is"", and ""win"".

The ""baba"" text block is already part of the ""baba is you"" rule. The ""is"" blocks are available. The ""win"" block is also available.

So the plan is: move the ""win"" block down to be near Baba, place an ""is"" next to it, and then the ""baba"" next to that. But how to do that given the walls?

Baba is at 5 left, 2 down. The ""win"" is at same x as Baba, 2 up. The ""is"" is at 1 left, 2 up. The ""baba"" text block is at 5 left, 2 down (same as Baba's position).

So if I can move the ""win"" down to 2 down (Baba's level), then place ""is"" to the right, and ""baba"" to the right of ""is"", that would form ""baba is win"".

But how to move the ""win"" block down? The ""win"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule, which is at 5 right, 4 up. To move the ""win"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction.

From Baba's position, to reach the ""win"" block at same x, 2 up, but there's a wall at 2 up. So I can't move up past the wall.

Alternative approach: Maybe move horizontally to the ""is"" block and then move vertically.

The ""is"" block is at 1 left, 2 up. So from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving left 4 steps to reach the ""is"" block? But there are walls at 1 step up, 2 up, etc. It seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I should try to move the ""key"" block instead. The key is at 2 left, 2 up. If I can move the key to a different position, maybe that changes the rule.

But how? To move the key, I need to be adjacent to it. From Baba's position, the key is 2 left and 2 up. To get there, I need to move left twice and up twice, but there's a wall at 2 up. So I'm blocked.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to find a different strategy. Since the key is the win condition, maybe I can push the key past the walls by rearranging other rules.

Wait, in Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not STOP. The key is not STOP unless there's a rule making it so. Currently, the only STOP is the wall at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. So the key can be pushed.

But to push the key, I need to be next to it and move in the opposite direction. For example, if I'm to the left of the key and move right, I can push it right. But how do I get next to the key?

The key is at 2 left and 2 up from Baba. To get there, I need to move left twice and up twice, but blocked by the wall at 2 up. So that's not possible.

Alternative idea: Maybe change the rule ""key is win"" to something that allows moving past the wall. For example, if I can make ""floor IS WIN"", then stepping on floor would make me win. But how?

To do that, I need to rearrange the text blocks ""key"", ""is"", ""win"" into ""floor is win"". But I don't have a ""floor"" text block. The available objects are wall, key, door, baba, etc.

Alternatively, create a rule like ""wall IS NOT STOP"", but I don't have a ""not"" block. Hmm.

Alternatively, use the existing ""stop"" rule. If I can create a rule that changes ""stop"" to something else. For example, ""stop IS YOU"", making the stop blocks controllable. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". There are other ""is"" and ""stop"" rules scattered around. For example, there's a rule `is` at 3 step to the left and 3 step up, and a rule `stop` at 2 step to the left and 3 step up.

Maybe I can use those to form new rules. Let's say I take the ""stop"" rule and rearrange it. If I can make ""stop IS WIN"", then touching stop would make me win. But how to get there.

The ""stop"" rule is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up from rule `baba`, which is 5 left, 2 down. So relative to Baba, that's 5 left +2 left =7 left, and 2 down +3 up=5 up. So the ""stop"" rule is 7 left and 5 up from Baba. That's quite far.

Not sure if that's reachable.

Another approach: Since the door is at 1 left and 4 down from Baba, and there's a wall at 1 step down, maybe I can push the wall out of the way. But walls are STOP, so I can't move them.

Wait, the wall at 1 step down is part of the ""stop"" rule. Maybe if I can change the ""stop"" property of that wall, it becomes movable. For example, if I make ""wall IS NOT STOP"", but again, no ""not"" block.

This is getting complicated. Let's recap:

- Goal: Reach the key (since key is win) or find another way to win.
- Blocked by walls at upper path.
- Need to rearrange rules to create a new path or change the win condition.
- Possible solution: Change ""key is win"" to ""baba is win"" so touching Baba wins.
- To do that, need to move ""win"" next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

But how to reach those text blocks?

Alternatively, maybe move the ""you"" rule. The ""you"" rule is at 3 left and 4 down from Baba. If I can change ""you"" to something else, but not sure.

Wait, the active rule ""baba is you"" means Baba is the player. If I can change ""you"" to another object, like ""key is you"", then I could control the key. But the key is at 2 left, 2 up, which is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, make ""key is you"", then move the key to the door. But the door is the win condition, so if key is you and door is","

56,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, I need to get the key to become the win condition. But the key is already labeled as win. Maybe the door is the actual win object now. The user's goal is usually to reach the win object, but since ""key is win"", touching the key would win the level. However, in the current observation, the key is located at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. The Baba entity is at 5 steps to the left and 2 steps down. The door is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down.

Wait, the rules say ""key is win"", so touching the key should make me win. But how do I get there? There's a wall at 1 step down, and another wall 2 steps down. The path to the key might be blocked. Let me check the map layout again.

Looking at the objects:

- The rule blocks are moving around as I move down each step. For example, initially, the wall was at 5 steps right and 4 step up, then it shifted left each time I moved down. Now, the wall is at 5 steps to the left and 4 step up. The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. But there's a wall at 1 step down, blocking the direct path. 

Baba is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach the key at 3 steps right and 1 step down, I need to move right twice and down once. But moving down once would take me to 5 steps left and 3 steps down, but there's a wall at 2 steps down. Wait, the walls are positioned at various steps. Let me parse the objects again:

- wall 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down
So, if I move down from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving down once would take me to 5 left, 3 down, but there's a wall at 2 steps down. Wait, no, the wall at 2 steps down is a separate object. Maybe I need to check if there's a path around the walls.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is not the actual win object. Wait, the active rule is ""key is win"", so holding the key makes me win. But how do I pick up the key? In Baba Is You, you can push objects if they are not STOP. But the key is a rule object. Wait, no. The key is an object that's defined as ""win"". To pick it up, I might need to move towards it. But the walls are blocking the path.

Looking at the current position of Baba: 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. The key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. So relative to Baba, that's right, right, down. But moving right twice would take me to 5 left - 2 steps right = 3 left, and down once would be 3 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 1 step down and another at 2 steps down. Wait, the walls are positioned at different locations. Let's see:

- wall 1 step down: So if I move down once from my current position (5 left, 2 down), that would be 5 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The wall at 1 step down is probably at a different horizontal position. The walls are listed as:

wall 1 step down
wall 2 steps down

But their horizontal positions aren't specified beyond the vertical. Wait, maybe the walls are arranged in a line. For example, the wall at 1 step down is directly below the initial position, and the wall at 2 steps down is further down. But Baba is at 5 left, 2 down. So moving down once would take him to 5 left, 3 down, which is where the wall at 2 steps down is located? Or maybe the walls are at different horizontal positions. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the path to the key is blocked by walls, so I need to find another way. Since ""baba is you"", I can move through objects unless they are STOP. But the walls are STOP, so I can't move through them. The key is at 3 right, 1 down. Let's map out the possible moves:

Current position: 5 left, 2 down.

Possible moves:

Right: 4 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects:

- wall 1 step down (but that's vertically)
- wall at 4 step up (vertically)
- The walls in horizontal positions might be at 5 steps right, etc. Wait, the walls are described as ""wall X steps to the right/down/left and Y steps up/down"". So each wall has both horizontal and vertical positions relative to the starting point?

This is getting complicated. Let me try to visualize the map.

Assuming the starting point is (0,0), then:

- rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 4 step up: that's at (-5,4)
- wall 4 step up: at (0,4)
- rule `key` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up: at (3,4)
- etc.

Baba's current position is 5 step to the left and 2 steps down: (-5, -2).

The key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down: (3, -1).

The door is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down: (4, -2).

So the path from Baba (-5,-2) to key (3,-1) requires moving right 8 steps and up 1 step. But there are walls blocking the way. Let's check the walls:

- wall at (-5,4), (0,4), (3,4), (4,4), etc. (upper walls)
- walls at various positions below. For example, wall at (0,1), (0,0), (0,-1), etc.

But in the current observation, the walls are:

- wall 1 step down: at (0,-1)
- wall 2 steps down: at (0,-2)
- wall at (3 step up): which is (0,3)
- etc.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to list all walls with their coordinates:

Assuming Baba is at (-5,-2):

- wall 5 step to the left and 4 step up: (-5,4)
- wall 4 step up: (0,4)
- wall 3 step up: (0,3)
- wall 2 step up: (0,2)
- wall 1 step up: (0,1)
- wall 1 step down: (0,-1)
- wall 2 steps down: (0,-2)
- wall at 5 steps right and 4 step up: (5,4)
- etc.

But this might not be accurate. The problem is that the description of walls and other objects includes both horizontal and vertical positions relative to the player's current position.

Alternatively, maybe all objects are positioned relative to Baba's current location. For example, ""wall 5 steps to the right"" would be 5 steps right from Baba's position.

But in the initial observations, when the user moved down, the walls shifted positions, suggesting that the map is dynamic and objects move as the player moves. So perhaps each time the player moves, the entire map shifts, and the positions are relative to the player's new position.

This complicates things, but assuming that the current observation lists the positions relative to Baba's location.

In the latest observation, the key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down from Baba. So to get there, Baba needs to move right three times and down once. However, there are walls blocking the path.

Looking at the objects:

- wall 1 step down: directly below Baba.
- wall 2 steps down: two steps below.
- Other walls are above.

So moving down from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down) is blocked by the wall at 1 step down. Wait, noâ€”Baba is at 2 steps down, so moving down once would take him to 3 steps down, where there's a wall. Therefore, he can't move straight down. He needs to move around the wall.

To move right towards the key, but there's a wall at 4 step up, but that's above. The lower walls are at 1 and 2 steps down. So the path to the key is blocked by the wall at 1 step down. Therefore, Baba needs to find another way, perhaps moving around the wall.

But how? If he moves right first, then down, avoiding the wall. Let's see:

Current position: (-5,-2) assuming (0,0) is Baba's starting point.

Key is at (3,-1).

Walls are at (0,-1) and (0,-2).

If Baba moves right twice to (-3,-2), then right again to (-2,-2), then right to (-1,-2), then right to (0,-2), but (0,-2) is a wall. So he can't go there. Then he needs to move down from (0,-2) is blocked. Alternatively, maybe move down from (-1,-2) to (-1,-3), but there's no wall mentioned there. But the active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So perhaps moving around the wall by going around it.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to push a wall out of the way, but since walls are STOP, he can't push them unless he's not STOP. But ""baba is you"", so he's not STOP. Wait, but the walls are defined as STOP, so unless there's a rule that changes their property, he can't move through them.

Alternatively, maybe the key is not the real win. Since the door is a common win object, but the rule says key is win. However, maybe the door is also a win if the rule is changed. But the current rules are still ""key is win"".

Wait, the goal is to reach the object defined as WIN. Currently, WIN is the key. So touching the key should win. But the key is blocked by walls. So how to reach it?

Another approach: Maybe the key is already in a position where you can take it without moving through walls. For example, if the key is adjacent, you can pick it up. But in the current observation, the key is 3 steps right and 1 down. So not adjacent.

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules. For example, create a new rule like ""baba is win"" so that reaching the door (which might be a win) would let you win. But how to do that?

To create a new rule, you need to move the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together. The current text blocks are:

- rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `is` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `you` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
- rule `key` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up
- etc.

So the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks are at positions:

- baba: (-5 -5 steps left? Wait, no. The rule `baba` is located at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down from Baba's current position. So if Baba is at (-5,-2), then the rule `baba` is at (-5 -5, -2 +2) = (-10,0)? That can't be right. Maybe the positions are described relative to the initial position, not relative to Baba's current position. This is getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the text blocks are fixed on the grid, and moving them requires moving them like objects. Since the player (Baba) can move through objects unless they are STOP, but the text blocks might be movable unless they are STOP.

Given that the active rules include ""baba is you"", and ""key is win"", and the objects that are STOP are the walls, maybe the text blocks (like ""baba"", ""is"", ""key"", etc.) are movable if they are not STOP. So to create a new rule, I need to move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks together to form ""baba is win"".

Looking at the current positions of the text blocks:

- rule `baba` is at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down from Baba's position. So if Baba is at (-5,-2), then the rule `baba` is at (-5 -5, -2 +2) = (-10, 0). But that seems far. Alternatively, maybe the positions are relative to the player's current location, so ""5 step to the left"" means 5 steps left from where the player is now.

In any case, the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down from Baba. To get there, he needs to move right three times and down once. However, moving down once would take him into a wall at 1 step down. So he needs to move around the wall.

If he moves right twice first, then down, then right once more. Let's see:

Move right from (-5,-2) to (-4,-2). Then right to (-3,-2). Then down to (-3,-3). Then right to (-2,-3), (-1,-3), (0,-3), (1,-3), (2,-3), (3,-3). But then he has to move up to reach the key's position at (3,-1). But this path might not be possible due to other walls.

Alternatively, move down first, but that's blocked. So maybe the only way is to move around the wall by going to the side. For example, move right past the wall.

Wait, the wall at 1 step down is at (0,-1). If Baba moves right past that, but how? If he moves right to (0,-2), which is a wall, he can't. So perhaps he needs to move up past the wall.

But the path up is clear. From (-5,-2), moving up to (-5, -1), (-5,0), etc., but there are walls at 4 step up, 3 step up, etc. So maybe there's a way to go around the upper walls.

Alternatively, the solution is to change the rule so that Baba becomes the WIN. For example, move the ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks together. The ""baba"" rule is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down, ""is"" is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down, and ""win"" is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up. To form ""baba is win"", he needs to bring these together.

But the positions are quite far. For example, the ""win"" text block is at 5 steps right and 4 steps up from Baba's current position. That's quite a distance. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the door at 4 steps right and 2 steps down is the actual win object, but the rule says key is win. However, if the player can push the door over by moving it, but doors are usually STOP unless the rule changes. Since the current rules don't say door is movable, it's probably a STOP object.

Given all this, the most straightforward solution might be to move towards the key despite the walls, but that seems blocked. Alternatively, rearrange the rules to make Baba the WIN. Let's see:

The ""baba"" rule is at 5 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 4 left, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 5 right,4 up. So to create ""baba is win"", we need to move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"".

But the distance is large. From Baba's position at (-5,-2), moving right to 5 right and 4 up is very far. Maybe this isn't the intended path.

Another angle: Since ""key is win"", and the key is an object, perhaps picking up the key makes Baba win. But how to pick it up? In Baba Is You, you push objects by moving into them from the side. So if the key is adjacent, you can push it, but since the key is a rule object, maybe you can take it by moving onto it.

If the key is 3 steps right and 1 down from Baba, and there's a clear path, then moving right three times and down once would reach the key. But the path is blocked by walls at 1 step down. So maybe the solution is to move around the wall by moving right first, then up, then down.

For example:

1. Move right twice to (-3,-2)
2. Move up once to (-3,-1)
3. Move right once to (-2,-1)
4. Move down once to (-2,-2)
5. Move right twice to (0,-2) (but that's a wall)
6. Alternatively, move right to (-1,-2), then down to (-1,-3), then right three times to (2,-3), then up to (2,-2), then right to (3,-2), then up to (3,-1) where the key is.

But this path may not be possible due to other walls. The key is at (3,-1), so from (3,-2), moving up once reaches the key. But getting to (3,-2) requires navigating through the walls.

Alternatively, maybe the key is reachable by moving down past the wall. But the wall is at 1 step down, so moving down from Baba's position (-5,-2) to (-5,-3) is possible if there's no wall there. But the observation only mentions walls at 1 and 2 steps down. So (-5,-3) might be clear. Then from there, move right towards the key.

Let me try to outline a possible path:

1. Move down from (-5,-2) to (-5,-3) (no wall there)
2. Move right to (-4,-3)
3. Move right to (-3,-3)
4. Move right to (-2,-3)
5. Move right to (-1,-3)
6. Move right to (0,-3)
7. Move right to (1,-3)
8. Move right to (2,-3)
9. Move right to (3,-3)
10. Move up to (3,-2)
11. Move up to (3,-1) (reaching the key)

This path avoids the walls at 1 and 2 steps down. However, I need to check if there are any other walls along this path. The observation lists walls at various positions, but it's possible that this","

I'm trying to solve this Baba Is You level. The goal is usually to get to the door, which is defined as 'win' right now. But the active rule says 'key is win', so actually touching the key makes it a win condition. That's a bit confusing. Let me look at the map again.

The player is Baba, controlled by 'baba is you'. The door is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But since the key is win, maybe I need to get the key first? Wait, no, the key is already set as win. So maybe just standing on the key counts as winning? But in the observations, the player is at 'rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down', which I think means Baba's position is 5 steps to the left and 2 steps down from the reference point. Let me parse that correctly.

Looking at the objects, the key is at 3 steps to the right and 1 step down. The door is at 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down. So the path from the key to the door is blocked by walls. There's a wall at 2 steps down. How do I move through that? Maybe I can rearrange the rules.

The active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. There are some 'stop' rules as well. The walls are probably stop, meaning I can't push them. But maybe I can move the 'is' or 'you' text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make 'baba is win' or something else. Wait, the current rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. So as long as I'm Baba, maybe I can just walk over the key to win? Let me check the positions again.

Baba is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down. The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down from where? Maybe the key is to the right and slightly above Baba's current position. Let me visualize the grid. If I move right, I can reach the key. But the path might be blocked. Let's see:

From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving right would take steps towards the key. But there's a wall at 1 step up, 2 step up, etc. Wait, the walls are at various positions. The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So moving right three times and down once? But the walls might be in the way. Let's list all the walls:

- wall 4 step up
- wall 3 step up
- wall 2 step up
- wall 1 step up
- wall 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down

So between Baba and the key, moving right three steps: from 5 left to 3 right (total 2 steps right from Baba's position?), but I need to check the exact coordinates. Maybe the walls are arranged such that there's a corridor. Alternatively, perhaps I need to rearrange the rules to become the key or the door.

Since 'key is win', touching the key should make it a win. But maybe I need to move the 'is' text block to change 'key is win' to something else. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then just standing on the door (which is win) would suffice. But how to move the 'is' blocks?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `is` at 4 steps to the right and 4 step up, and another `is` at 3 step left and 3 step up. Also, `you` is at 2 step left and 2 steps down. To move these text blocks, they can't be 'stop', so they can be pushed. So maybe I can move the `is` block from 3 step left and 3 step up to link with 'baba' and 'win'.

But the player is Baba, so if I can move the 'is' next to 'baba' and 'win', then it becomes 'baba is win'. Let's see the positions. The `baba` rule is at 5 step left and 2 steps down. The `win` rule is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. The `is` block is at 3 step left and 3 step up. So perhaps moving that `is` block to connect with both 'baba' and 'win'.

To do that, I need to navigate to the `is` block at 3 step left and 3 step up. From Baba's current position (5 left, 2 down), moving left three steps would get to the `is` block. Then, move it towards 'baba' and 'win'. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to push the `is` block using other objects. Since the walls are 'stop', I can't push them. But the key and door might be movable. However, the key is 'win' now, so touching it would make the game end. Maybe not the best approach.

Another angle: since 'baba is you', and the goal is to reach 'win' (which is the key), perhaps moving right towards the key. But the path is blocked by walls at 1 step down and 2 steps down. Wait, the wall at 2 steps down is right next to the door. So maybe the key is behind some walls that I can't pass through unless I change a rule to make a wall non-stop.

Looking at the active rules, there's a 'stop' rule at 2 step left and 3 step up. If I can remove that 'stop' property, the wall there becomes passable. But how? To do that, I need to break the 'stop' rule. To break a rule, I need to move the text blocks so that the rule is no longer valid.

For example, if the rule is 'wall is stop', and I can move 'stop' to another position, then 'wall' might no longer be stop. Wait, in the current observation, the active rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up, but what exactly is that rule saying? It's probably 'something is stop'. Looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` 3 step to the right and 2 step up. Wait, the exact objects list:

Objects include:
- rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 4 step up
- rule `key` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
- ... other walls and objects

So the 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up, but what is it stopping? Maybe it's 'wall is stop', but the exact subject isn't clear. If I can move the 'stop' text block away, then the wall might no longer be stop, allowing passage.

But how to move the 'stop' rule? It's a text block, so as long as it's not itself a 'stop' object, I can move it. Wait, the 'stop' rule is a text block that defines something as stop. If I can move the 'stop' text block, then the rule it defines would change. For example, if the rule was 'wall is stop' and I move 'stop' to 'baba', then it becomes 'baba is stop', making Baba immovable. Not good.

Alternatively, if I can move the 'is' next to 'stop' to change the rule. Suppose the current rule is 'X is stop', and I can rearrange it to 'stop is Y' or something else. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: since the key is win, maybe I just need to touch it. If I can reach the key at 3 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. Let's see:

Baba is at 5 step left and 2 step down. To get to the key at 3 steps right and 1 step down, the direction would be right three times and down once. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the walls between:

From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving right three steps would take me to 2 left, then 1 left, then neutral. But between there and the key, down one step. However, there's a wall at 1 step down, which is the same level as the key (key is 1 step down). Wait, the key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move right three times and down once from Baba's position, that would be the key's location. But the wall at 1 step down is at wall 1 step down, which is probably in the same horizontal line. Maybe that's blocking the path.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to move the key. Since the key is 'win', but it's a regular object unless defined otherwise. Wait, 'key is win' means that the key's win property is active, but can I move the key? If the key is not stop, then yes. Looking at the active rules, is there a 'stop' rule for the key? The 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up, which is probably a different object. So the key is movable.

If I can move the key to the door's position, then standing on the key (which is win) would make the door irrelevant. But the door is at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. To move the key right one step and down one step, but there's a wall at 2 steps down. So maybe not possible.

Alternatively, use the text blocks to create a new rule. For example, if I can make 'baba is win', then just standing on the door (which is win) would work. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block next to 'baba' and 'win'.

The 'baba' rule is at 5 step left and 2 steps down. The 'win' rule is at 5 steps right and 4 step up. The 'is' block we need is at 3 step left and 3 step up. So perhaps moving that 'is' block to connect 'baba' and 'win'.

From Baba's position, moving left three steps to reach the 'is' block at 3 step left and 3 step up. Then, move the 'is' block towards 'baba' (left direction) and 'win' (up direction). But how to move it?

Once I have the 'is' block, I can push it left to connect with 'baba' (which is at 5 step left, 2 steps down). So moving the 'is' block left one step would place it at 4 step left and 3 step up. Then, maybe move it down to align with 'baba'? Or adjust the position to form 'baba is win'.

This requires navigating to the 'is' block, picking it up (by moving over it), and then moving it into the correct position. Since the player is Baba, and 'baba is you', they can move other objects that are not stop.

The walls are stop, so I can't push them, but the 'is', 'you', 'key', 'win' blocks are movable. So the plan is:

1. Move from current position (5 left, 2 down) to the 'is' block at 3 left, 3 up.
   - Directions: left three times, up once. But need to check if path is clear.
   - The walls are at 4 step up, 3 step up, etc., which are above the 'is' block. So path might be clear.

2. Once at the 'is' block, move it left to connect with 'baba'.
   - 'baba' is at 5 left, 2 down. So moving the 'is' left one step to 4 left, 3 up.
   - Then move down to 4 left, 2 down to be next to 'baba'.

3. Now the rule would be 'baba is [something]', but we need to connect it to 'win'.
   - The 'win' rule is at 5 right, 4 up. So from the 'is' block at 4 left, 2 down, moving right five steps and up four steps is too far.
   - Alternatively, maybe move the 'win' rule closer? But 'win' is a rule, and its position is fixed unless moved.

Alternatively, find another 'is' block. There's another 'is' at 4 right, 4 up. Maybe use that to link 'win' with something else.

This is getting complicated. Maybe a simpler approach: since the key is win, just reach the key. To do that, move right three times and down once. But check if there are walls in the way.

From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down):

- Moving right once: to 4 left, 2 down. Is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step down, which is the same horizontal line. Wait, the walls are at various positions:

  - wall 4 step up
  - wall 3 step up
  - wall 2 step up
  - wall 1 step up
  - wall 1 step down
  - wall 2 steps down

So when moving right from 5 left to 4 left, same down level (2 down), is there a wall? The wall at 1 step down is in a different horizontal position. So maybe no wall there. Then move right again to 3 left, 2 down. Check for walls. The wall at 1 step down is at 1 step down, which is different. Then move right to 2 left, 2 down. Still no wall. Finally, move right to 1 left, 2 down. Now, moving down to 1 left, 1 down. Is there a wall at 1 step down? Yes, a wall is at 1 step down. So can't move down there. Therefore, can't go around that wall.

Hmm, that's a problem. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall at 1 step down. How to get around it? Maybe remove the 'stop' property from that wall. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. If I can move that 'stop' rule away, the wall might no longer be stop, allowing passage.

To move the 'stop' rule, which is at 2 step left and 3 step up. From Baba's position (5 left, 2 down), moving left two steps and up one step would reach the 'stop' rule. Then, move it in a direction that removes its effect. For example, moving 'stop' to a different position so that the rule it's part of is broken.

The 'stop' rule is likely part of a rule like 'X is stop'. If I can move 'stop' away from X, then X is no longer stop. Suppose the original rule is 'wall is stop' and the 'stop' text block is adjacent to 'wall'. By moving 'stop' away, the rule is broken, making the wall passable.

But where is the 'wall' that this 'stop' is applying to? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 step up. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. So perhaps the wall at 4 step up has the 'stop' property because of the 'stop' rule next to it. If I move the 'stop' rule away, the wall's stop property is removed.

So steps to do this:

1. Move from Baba's position (5 left, 2 down) to the 'stop' rule at 2 left, 3 up.
   - Direction: left two steps, up one step.

2. Once at the 'stop' rule, move it in a direction that breaks the 'wall is stop' rule. For example, move it down or to the side so it's no longer adjacent to the wall.

3. Now, the wall at 4 step up is no longer stop, so it can be passed.

But after removing the 'stop' from the wall, can I go around it? The wall is at 4 step up. From Baba's new position near the 'stop' rule, moving up past the wall might be possible.

Once the wall is no longer stop, Baba can move through it. Then, proceed to the key.

Alternatively, after removing the 'stop' from the wall, navigate around it to reach the key.

This seems like a viable path. Let's outline the steps:

- Move left twice, up once to reach the 'stop' rule.
- Move the 'stop' rule away, say to the right, breaking the 'wall is stop' rule.
- Now, the wall at 4 step up is passable.
- Move around the wall to reach the key.

But how exactly to move the 'stop' rule? Since it's a text block, as long as it's not itself stopped, which it's not (since 'stop' is the rule, not the object), Baba can move it.

From the 'stop' rule's position (2 left, 3 up), moving it right would place it at 3 left, 3 up. That breaks the adjacency with whatever it was applying to (probably the wall at 4 up). Now, the wall is no longer stop.

Then, Baba can move up past the wall, or find another path.

Alternatively, after moving the 'stop' rule, head towards the key.

Once past the wall, the path to the key might be clear. From the wall at 4 step up, moving down to the key's area.

This is getting quite complicated, but I think this is the way to go. So the chosen action would involve moving left and up to reach the 'stop' rule, then moving it to remove the wall's stop property.

58,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. Since the player is Baba (because ""baba is you""), I need to reach the key.

Looking at the objects, the key is located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's a wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe the path isn't directly clear. Let me check the map again.

The door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But the key is at 4 steps right, 1 down. So maybe moving right towards the key. But how do I get past the wall? The walls are either stop or part of other rules. Since ""stop"" makes objects immovable, I can't push them. But maybe I can rearrange the rules to bypass the wall.

Looking at the text blocks nearby, there's a rule ""stop"" at 1 step left and 3 step up. Also, there's a rule ""baba is you"" at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. Maybe I can move those text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""wall"" not a stop, then I could move through it. But how?

Alternatively, since the key is the win object, if I can pick up the key by moving onto it. But the key is 4 steps right and 1 step down from my current position. Let me check where Baba is located. The rule ""baba"" is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So my position is 4 left, 2 down. To get to the key at 4 right, 1 down, I need to move right twice and down once. But the path might be blocked by walls.

Wait, the wall is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So moving down from my current position (4 left, 2 down) to 4 left, 3 down would hit a wall. But the key is at 4 right, 1 down, which is in a different direction. Maybe there's another way. Let me visualize the grid.

Current position: Assuming Baba is at (0,0) for simplicity. The key is at (4, -1). The walls are at (1, -2), (0, -1), (0,0), etc. So to go right from (0,0) to (4,0) would pass through walls at (1,0), (0,0) is a wall? Wait, the wall is at 1 step right and 4 step up originally, but after some moves, the walls might have shifted positions. Hmm, maybe the observations are getting updated as I move. 

Wait, in the latest observation, the wall positions are changing. Previously, the walls were moving left and right as I moved right earlier. It seems like the level is shifting the walls as I move. So perhaps the key is moving, or the walls are dynamically changing. That complicates things.

Since the key is defined as win, maybe the actual goal is to reach the key regardless of the path. But the walls are stopping me. How can I move through them? The only way is to change the 'stop' rule. If I can make 'wall' not a stop, then I can walk through them. To do that, I need to find the 'stop' text block and either move it away or rearrange the rules.

Looking at the current objects, there's a rule 'stop' at 2 step left and 3 step up. Also, there's a rule 'is' at 3 step left and 2 step down, and 'you' at 2 step left and 2 step down. If I can move the 'stop' rule out of the way, then 'wall' won't be stop anymore. But to move a rule, I have to be on the same tile as the text block and not be stopped. Since Baba is you, and if 'baba is you' is a rule, you can move unless there's a 'stop' on your current tile.

In the current observation, Baba's position is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So his coordinates are (4 left, 2 down). The 'stop' rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. To move towards the key, which is at 4 right and 1 down, I need to go right twice and down once. But moving down from (4 left, 2 down) to (4 left, 3 down) would hit a wall at 1 step right and 2 step up? Wait, the walls are positioned dynamically. Maybe I need to check the exact positions again.

Alternatively, maybe I can push a wall if it's not stop. But walls are defined as stop, so they can't be moved. So the only way is to change the 'stop' rule. Let's see. The 'stop' rule is at 2 step left and 3 step up. To move that rule, I need to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. Since I'm at 4 left, 2 down, the 'stop' rule is at 2 left, 3 up. The distance between me and the 'stop' rule is 2 steps left and 3 steps up. I can't move diagonally, only up, down, left, right. So to reach the 'stop' rule, I need to move left twice and up three times, but that's not possible in one step. Maybe there's another text block I can use.

Wait, there's a rule 'is' at 3 step left and 2 step down. If I can move that 'is' to combine with 'wall' or 'stop' to change the rules. For example, if I can make 'wall IS NOT stop' by rearranging the text blocks. But how? Let's think.

The current rules are 'key is win' and 'baba is you'. The other rules are part of the level's setup. To create a new rule, I need to have two text blocks: a subject and a property. For example, if I move 'wall' next to 'not stop', but there's no 'not' in the current text blocks. Alternatively, maybe I can swap 'stop' with another property.

Wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. If I can move towards the key, but the path is blocked by a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. Let me check that again. The wall is at 1 step right and 2 steps down from where? From the current Baba position (4 left, 2 down), moving right once would be 3 left, 2 down. Then right again to 2 left, 2 down. Then down to 2 left, 3 down. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 3 step up? Wait, the walls' positions are a bit confusing. Maybe I need to focus on moving the rules instead.

The key insight is that since 'key is win', picking up the key (by moving onto it) would make me win. So the goal is to reach the key. To do that, I need to navigate around or through the walls by changing the rules. Since walls are 'stop', maybe I can remove the 'stop' property from 'wall' by redefining it. For example, create a new rule 'wall is not stop', but there's no 'not' text block. Alternatively, use existing rules.

Looking at the available text blocks: 'wall', 'key', 'is', 'win', 'stop', 'baba', 'you'. If I can combine 'wall' with another property. For instance, if I can make 'wall' be 'win' instead of 'stop', then I could walk through them. But to do that, I need to move the 'is' rule to connect 'wall' with 'win'. 

The current 'is' rules are at various positions. For example, there's an 'is' at 9 steps right and 4 step up (part of 'key is win'), another at 2 step right and 3 step up (part of 'stop is'), and another at 3 step left and 2 step down (part of 'baba is you'). If I can move the 'is' that's connected to 'stop' to instead connect 'wall' to a different property.

But to move an 'is' text block, I have to be adjacent to it and not be stopped. Let's see where the 'is' blocks are. The 'is' at 3 step left and 2 step down is part of 'baba is you'. If I can move that 'is' to link 'wall' to something else. For example, move the 'is' next to 'wall' and 'not stop', but there's no 'not' here. Alternatively, move the 'is' that's currently linking 'stop' to something else.

Wait, there's a rule 'stop' 1 step to the left and 3 step up. The 'is' for that is at 2 step to the left and 3 step up. If I can move that 'is' to instead link 'wall' to a different property. For example, move the 'is' block next to 'wall' and 'win', making 'wall is win'. That way, walls wouldn't be stop anymore, and I could walk through them.

But how to do that? Currently, the 'is' block is linking 'stop' to whatever property. To reassign it, I need to be adjacent to both 'wall' and the new property. Let's see. The 'wall' is at 4 step left and 4 step up. The 'is' block is at 2 step left and 3 step up. If I can move the 'is' block to be next to 'wall' and 'win', then I can create the new rule.

But the distance between the current 'is' position (2 left, 3 up) and 'wall' (4 left, 4 up) is 2 steps left and 1 step down. That's not adjacent. So perhaps I need to move the 'is' block step by step. First, move the 'is' block down to be next to 'stop', then move it to 'wall' and 'win'.

Alternatively, look for other 'is' blocks. There's another 'is' at 5 steps right and 4 step up (part of 'key is win'). If I can move that 'is' to link 'wall' to 'win'. But that 'is' is part of the active rule 'key is win', so moving it might break that rule. But since the game allows rearranging rules, maybe it's possible.

This is getting complicated. Let me summarize the steps needed:

1. Reach the key to make it the win condition.
2. Path is blocked by walls with 'stop' property.
3. Change the 'stop' property of walls by redefining the rule.
4. To do that, move 'is' blocks to link 'wall' to a different property, like 'win'.

Possible actions:

- Move towards the key, but need to avoid walls. If walls can't be moved, need to find a way around by changing rules.
- Find the 'is' block that defines 'stop' and move it to redefine 'wall's property.

Looking at the current map, the 'is' block for 'stop' is at 2 step left and 3 step up. The 'wall' is at 4 step left and 4 step up. The distance between them is 2 steps left and 1 step down. To move the 'is' block from (2L, 3U) to (4L,4U), I need to move it right twice and up once. But each move can only be one step. So, move right once to (1L,3U), then right again to (0L,3U), then up to (0L,4U), then left to (4L,4U)? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe another path.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block down to adjacent to 'stop', then move it to 'wall'. But this requires navigating the 'is' block through the grid.

Alternatively, use the 'is' block that's part of 'baba is you' at 3L, 2D. If I can move that 'is' block to connect 'wall' to 'win', then walls wouldn't be stop. But how?

The 'is' block is at 3L, 2D. The 'wall' is at 4L,4U. The distance is 1 step left and 6 steps up. That's too far. Not feasible in one move.

This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to move towards the key step by step, even if it means walking through walls if I can change their property. But how?

Wait, the key is at 4R,1D. From my current position (4L,2D), moving right once would be 3L,2D. Then right again to 2L,2D. Then down to 2L,3D. But there's a wall at 1R,2U (from where? Maybe the wall positions are different now). Need to check the exact positions again.

The current walls are:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 2 steps down

So the walls form a vertical line on the right side, from 4U down to 2D. The key is at 4R,1D, which is just next to the wall at 1R,1D. So to get to the key, I need to go past that wall. But since it's a stop, I can't. So I need to remove the stop property.

The only way is to redefine the wall's property. For example, make 'wall is win' instead of 'stop'. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block that's linking 'stop' to something else to instead link 'wall' to 'win'.

Looking at the 'is' blocks:

- The main 'is' for 'key is win' is at 9R,4U.
- The 'is' for 'stop' is at 2L,3U.
- The 'is' for 'baba is you' is at 3L,2D.

If I can move the 'is' at 2L,3U (which is part of 'stop is ...') to instead connect 'wall' to 'win', then walls wouldn't be stop. But how to do that?

The 'is' block at 2L,3U is adjacent to 'stop' (which is at 1L,3U) and possibly another text block. If I can move this 'is' block to be next to 'wall' and 'win', then create the new rule.

The 'wall' is at 4L,4U. The 'win' is at 6R,4U. The 'is' block at 2L,3U is between 'stop' (1L,3U) and possibly other objects. To move the 'is' block from 2L,3U to be next to 'wall' (4L,4U), I need to move it right twice and up once. But each move is one step.

Alternatively, move the 'is' block step by step. First, move it right to 1L,3U (adjacent to 'stop'). Then up to 1L,4U. Then right to 2L,4U. Then right to 3L,4U. Then right to 4L,4U, placing it next to 'wall' and 'win'. Once there, the 'is' would connect 'wall' to 'win', making walls passable.

But this requires multiple moves, and the current observation shows that after several rights, the map is shifting. It's possible that the level is dynamic, and the walls move as I move, making this approach difficult.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the key is win, maybe I can pick it up by moving onto it. But to get there, I need to navigate around the walls. If I can change the 'stop' rule to something else, like 'stop is key', then walls wouldn't stop me, but that might not help.

Another angle: The 'baba is you' rule means I can push objects if they're not stop. But the walls are stop, so I can't push them. However, if I can make 'wall' not stop, then I could move through them. So the key is to redefine the 'stop' property.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a 'stop' rule and a 'key is win' rule. If I can create a new rule that 'wall' is 'win', then I can walk through walls. To do that, I need to move the 'is' block from connecting 'stop' to whatever it's connected to, to connect 'wall' to 'win'.

The 'is' block connected to 'stop' is at 2L,3U. If I can move that 'is' block to be next to 'wall' and 'win', then the new rule 'wall is win' would be created, making walls passable.

But how to move the 'is' block there? The 'is' is at 2L,3U. 'Wall' is at 4L,4U. 'Win' is at 6R,4U. The distance is significant. Maybe I can move the 'is' block down to 2L,4U, then right to 3L,4U, then right to 4L,4U, placing it between 'wall' and 'win'. Once there, the new rule 'wall is win' would be active, and I could walk through walls.

This requires several moves, but perhaps possible. However, given the current observation and the fact that the previous attempts resulted in defaults to idle, maybe the immediate action should be to move towards the key, assuming that by some means the walls can be bypassed.

Alternatively, check if there's a way to push a rule to change 'stop' to another property. For example, if I can make 'stop is key', then walls would be key, and since key is win, maybe that helps. But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the previous failures, maybe the best immediate action is to keep moving right towards the key, hoping that by rearranging rules in previous steps, the path is now clear. Alternatively, try moving down to","

Let's see. The current active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But how do I reach it?

Looking at the objects on the map. There's a door at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. Maybe that's the exit, but the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, but the key itself is the win condition. So grabbing the key should make it possible to win, right?

But the path is blocked. The walls are positioned such that moving directly right might hit a wall. Let me check the map layout again. The walls are at various positions. From the current position of Baba (assuming I'm at the rule 'baba' which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down), I need to figure out how to move towards the key.

The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule. So if I move right four times and down once, I reach the key. But between here and the key, there are walls. Let's see:

Current position: rule 'baba' is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So maybe my actual position is somewhere else. Wait, the observation lists all objects, including the rules. The 'baba' rule is at 4 steps left and 2 steps down. The door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. So the map is probably laid out with Baba being able to move around these rules and objects.

The walls are at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up, and others in a vertical line. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule. But moving right from there might hit a wall. Let me map this out.

If I'm at the 'baba' rule position (4 left, 2 down), to get to the key (4 right, 1 down), I need to move right four times and down once. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the walls:

- Wall at 1 step right and 4 up: that's way above.
- Walls at 1 step right and 3,2,1 up, then 1 step right, then 1 step down. So from the starting position (4 left, 2 down), moving right would take me towards the wall at 1 step right and 4 up? Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative. This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to visualize the grid.

Assuming the 'baba' rule is at position (0,0) for simplicity. Then:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 4 step up would be at (-4,4)
- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up is at (1,4)
- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up is at (4,4)
- And so on for other objects.

But the door is at (5,2). The key is at (4,1). So from Baba's position (0,0), moving right to (1,0), then (2,0), etc., but need to check for walls.

Wait, there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 4 step up, but that's high up. The vertical walls are at 1 step right from y=4 down to y=1, then a gap at y=0, then another wall at y=-1 (1 step down from y=0). So moving right from Baba's position (0,0):

- Step right to (1,0): is there a wall here? The observation lists walls at 1 step right and 4 up, 3 step up, etc., but not at (1,0). So maybe that's clear.

But to reach the key at (4,1), need to move right four times and down once. However, moving down from (4,0) to (4,1) is where the key is. But is there a wall in between?

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 1 step down (from y=4), but that's at (1,-1). Not directly in the path to the key. The key is at (4,1). So the path from (0,0) to (4,1) would be right four times, then down once. But need to check if any steps in between are blocked.

Wait, the wall at 1 step right and 3 step up is at (1,3), which is above, so not in the way. The walls descend from y=4 to y=1 at x=1. Then at x=1, y=0 is open. So moving right from x=0 to x=4 should be possible as long as there are no walls in between. Since the only walls on the right side are from x=1, y=4 down to y=1, but that's a vertical line at x=1. So moving right past x=1 to x=4 should be clear.

Therefore, the path is right four times, then down once. But since the key is at (4,1), maybe I can move down first? No, because from (0,0) moving down to (0,-1) but there's a wall at 1 step down from y=0 (x=1, y=-1?), but that's at (1,-1). So moving down from (0,0) to (0,-1) is possible if not blocked. Wait, the wall at 1 step down is listed as ""wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down"". So that's at (1,-1). So moving down from (0,0) to (0,-1) is allowed, as there's no wall there.

But the key is at (4,1). So maybe the optimal path is right, right, right, right, down. But that's five moves. Alternatively, right four times to (4,0), then down to (4,1).

However, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So once I pick up the key, does that make it a win condition? Or do I need to bring it to the door? The door is at (5,2). So after getting the key, maybe I need to move to the door. But the door's rule is not specified here; it's just a door object. The active rules are key is win, so having the key should be sufficient to win. But sometimes in Baba Is You, you have to be on the object to win. So maybe I need to stand on the key.

But the key is at (4,1). So moving right four times from (0,0) to (4,0), then down to (4,1), then stand there. Since key is win, that should trigger the win condition. But I need to check if moving there is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the win condition, but no, the active rule says key is win. So the solution is to reach the key.

But the problem is the path. Let's confirm the walls again. The walls at x=1 from y=1 to y=4. So when moving right from x=0 to x=4, the path from x=1 to x=4 on y=0 is clear. So moving right four times is possible.

So the sequence would be: right, right, right, right, down. But since each action is one step, the agent needs to execute these steps. However, the previous attempts had the agent moving right multiple times but getting stuck due to walls or other issues. Maybe the current observation has a different layout.

Wait, in the latest observation, after some moves, the positions have shifted slightly. For example, in one of the previous steps, the wall positions changed from 4 step left and 4 up to 5 step left and 4 up. So the layout is dynamic, perhaps based on moving rules.

But given the current observation, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule. To get there, the agent needs to move right four times and then down once. However, each movement must be valid (not into a wall or a 'stop' object).

Looking at the current objects:

- There's a wall at 1 step to the right and 4 step up (x=1, y=4)
- Walls at x=1, y=3, 2, 1 (vertical line)
- Then at x=1, y=0 and below are open?
- The key is at x=4, y=1
- The 'baba' rule is at x=-4, y=-2 (assuming the coordinates are relative)

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to move right as much as possible, then down.

But in the previous actions, moving right multiple times led to the agent being near the key but blocked. Wait, in the current observation, after several rights, the agent might be next to the key. Let's check the latest observation:

In the last observation before this one, the agent moved right multiple times, and now the objects are:

rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 4 step up
wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up
rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 step up
rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up
wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
wall 1 step to the right
wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
key 4 steps to the right and 1 step down
rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down
rule `you` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down
wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down
door 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down

Assuming 'baba' is at 4 step left and 2 step down, which would be position (-4, -2). The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the 'baba' rule, so that's (-4 +4, -2 -1) = (0, -3). Wait, maybe the coordinates are relative to the 'baba' rule's position. This is confusing without a clear map.

Alternatively, the 'baba' rule is at a certain position, and other objects are relative to that. For example, if 'baba' is at (0,0), then:

- rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 4 step up is at (-4,4)
- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up is at (1,4)
- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up is at (4,4)
- rule `is` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up is at (5,4)
- rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up is at (6,4)
- rule `is` 2 step to the left and 3 step up is at (-2,3)
- rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up is at (-1,3)
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up is at (1,3)
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up is at (1,2)
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up is at (1,1)
- wall 1 step to the right is at (1,0)
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down is at (1,-1)
- key 4 steps to the right and 1 step down is at (4,-1)
- rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down is at (-4,-2) (but this would be the same as the original 'baba' position?)
- rule `is` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down is at (-3,-2)
- rule `you` 2 step to the left and 2 steps down is at (-2,-2)
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down is at (1,-2)
- door 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down is at (5,-2)

This makes more sense. So the 'baba' rule is at (0,0), and other objects are positioned relative to that. Wait, but the 'baba' rule in the observation is listed as ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"", which would be at (-4,-2) if the starting point is (0,0). But then the key is at (4,-1), which is to the right and down from (-4,-2). So the agent (Baba) needs to move from (-4,-2) to (4,-1).

The path would be:

From (-4,-2):

1. Move right four times to (0,-2)
2. Move right four more times to (4,-2)
3. Move down once to (4,-1) to get the key.

But wait, there's a wall at (1,0) (1 step right), (1,-1), (1,-2). So moving right from (-4,-2) to (0,-2) is clear. Then from (0,-2) to (1,-2): is there a wall? At (1,-2) there's a wall. So can't move there. So need to go around.

Alternatively, maybe move right past the wall at (1,-2). Since the wall is at (1,-2), moving right from (0,-2) to (1,-2) is blocked. So need to find another path.

Wait, the walls are at (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (1,-2). So the entire right side from x=1 is blocked from y=4 down to y=-2. Except at y=-3 and below, but the key is at (4,-1), which is to the right of x=1.

So to get past x=1, the agent needs to go around. Maybe move up above the wall, then right, then down.

For example:

From (-4,-2):

1. Move up to (-4, -1)
2. Move up to (-4,0)
3. Move up to (-4,1)
4. Move up to (-4,2)
5. Move up to (-4,3)
6. Move up to (-4,4) â€“ but is there a wall there? There's a rule `wall` at (-4,4), but it's a rule, not a physical wall unless it's defined as stop. The active rule is ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The wall rule is ""rule `wall` 4 step to the left and 4 step up"", which is a text block, not a stop property unless there's a ""STOP"" rule. Looking at the active rules, there's ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"", which is at (-1,3). So the wall at (-4,4) is just a rule, not a stop, so can be moved over.

So moving up to (-4,4) is possible. Then move right to (-3,4), (-2,4), (-1,4), (0,4), (1,4). But at (1,4) there's a wall rule, but since it's not a stop, can move over it. Then continue right to (4,4). Then move down to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), which is the key's position.

This seems like a possible path. But it's quite long. However, considering the agent has to navigate around the wall blocking the direct right path, this might be necessary.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. For example, move right from (-4,-2) to (0,-2), then up to (0,4), then right to (4,4), then down to (4,-1). But that's even longer.

Alternatively, move right past the wall at x=1 by moving above it. From (-4,-2), move up to (-4,4), right to (4,4), then down to (4,-1). That's 0,-2 â†’ 0,4 (up 6 steps), right 4 steps, down 5 steps. Total 15 steps. Seems possible but time-consuming.

But the agent needs to choose the next action. Given the current position of Baba (as per the latest observation), where is he located?

In the latest observation, the 'baba' rule is at 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. Assuming the starting point is (0,0), that would place Baba at (-4,-2). The key is at (4,-1). The door is at (5,-2).

So the immediate next step could be to move right towards the key, but need to avoid the wall at x=1. So from (-4,-2), moving right to (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2) â€“ but at (-1,-2), is there a wall? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down, which would be (1,-2). So moving right from (-4,-2) to (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2) is allowed. Then at x=-1, y=-2, next step right to x=0, y=-2. Then x=0 to x=1, but x=1,y=-2 is a wall. So can't go there. So need to go up from x=0,y=-2 to x=0,y=4, then right.

But this requires multiple steps. However, the agent has to choose the next action. The current possible valid actions are up, down, left, right, or idle. But the agent can only move if the destination is not a STOP object.

Looking at the active rules, there's ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"" which is at (-1,3). So any object or position defined as STOP is immovable. In this case, the wall at (1,-2) is a STOP because it's defined","

The goal is to reach the door, which is probably the ""win"" condition. But right now, the active rule is ""key is win"", meaning touching the key makes you win. Alternatively, maybe the door is the win object, but the rule says key is win. So perhaps I need to get the key.

Looking at the map, the key is located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. The player (Baba) is at 4 steps to the left and 2 steps down. So the path to the key is blocked by walls. Let me check the path.

From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), moving right would head towards the wall at 1 step to the right. The key is to the right of that. But the key is at 4 right and 1 down. So maybe moving down first?

Wait, the current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So if I can get the key, I win. But the walls are stopping me. The walls are at 1 step to the right at various positions. Maybe I need to move the ""is"" or ""you"" rules to change the behavior of the walls.

Looking at the text blocks, there's a rule ""stop"" at 1 step left and 3 step up. And ""wall"" at 4 left and 4 up. Maybe I can move the ""is"" or ""you"" to make the wall something else. For example, if I can make a wall become passable by changing its property.

But how? Baba is you, so I can move text blocks that aren't stop. The ""is"" blocks are movable. Let's see. There's a rule ""key is win"" at 4 right, 4 up. If I can break that rule, maybe I can change what's win. But I need to move the ""is"" or ""you"" somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by moving the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks. Let's see. The ""is"" block is at 5 steps right and 4 up (part of ""key is win""). If I move that ""is"" to connect Baba with win, that could change the rules. But to do that, I need to pick up the ""is"" block, which is allowed because nothing is stopping it (it's not a STOP property).

Baba's position is 4 left, 2 down. The ""is"" block is at 5 right, 4 up. So the path to get there is blocked by walls. Maybe I need to move other objects first. But all the walls are marked as stop, so I can't move them. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""you"" block. The ""you"" is at 2 right, 2 down. If I can move that to connect with something else, like making Baba win. For example, moving ""you"" to Baba and ""win"" to create ""baba is you win""? Not sure. The game rules might require specific arrangements.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So as Baba, if I can touch the key, I win. But the key is behind walls. So maybe I need to remove the wall's stop property. To do that, I can change the rule defining the wall as stop. For example, if there's a rule ""wall is stop"", and if I can break that by moving the text blocks.

Looking at the objects, there's a rule ""stop"" at 1 left, 3 up, and a wall at 4 up. So the wall's stop property comes from the ""stop"" rule. If I can move that ""stop"" rule away, the wall might no longer be stop. But how?

The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. But Baba is at 4 left, 2 down. The distance is quite far. Maybe moving horizontally first. Let's calculate the steps needed.

From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down) to the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 3 up. To get there, need to move left 3 steps and up 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at 1 step right and 3 step up there's a wall. So movement is restricted.

Alternatively, maybe focus on getting to the key first. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. To get there, from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), need to move right 8 steps and down 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls on the right side. The walls start at 1 step right and go up to 4 step up. Then at 1 step right and down, there's a wall. So moving right past the walls is impossible unless the walls are no longer stop.

This seems tricky. Maybe the solution is to change the rules. For example, make the wall not a stop. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the wall becomes passable. Let's see. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, 3 up. If I can move that rule to another position, like attaching it to something else.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule? Since Baba is you, I can move any text block that's not stop. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block, but is it considered stop? If the rule is ""stop"", then maybe it's part of the stop property. So perhaps I can't move it because it's defined as stop. Wait, the rules about what's stop are in the active rules. The active rule is ""stop 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". So the stop property is applied to the wall at that position. The ""stop"" rule itself is a text block that defines where stop is. So as long as the rule exists, that wall is stop. But can I move the ""stop"" rule text block?

Since the rule says ""stop"" is at 1 left, 3 up, but the text block ""stop"" is a movable object unless it's part of a stop rule. Wait, the STOP property is an attribute of an object, not the rule itself. The rule ""stop X"" makes X have the stop property. So the text block ""stop"" is just a label, and can be moved as long as it's not part of a stop rule. Wait, no. The STOP property is assigned to an object via a rule. So if there's a rule ""wall is stop"", then that wall is stop. The ""stop"" text block itself is a separate object that can be moved unless it's part of a stop rule. But in this case, the ""stop"" rule is separate; it's a text block that tells where stop is applied.

So the ""stop"" text block at 1 left, 3 up is a movable object. Since it's not itself defined as stop, I can pick it up and move it. That way, the wall at 1 left, 3 up would no longer be stop, because the rule defining it as stop has been moved.

So the plan is: move the ""stop"" rule away from the wall, making the wall passable, then go around the walls to reach the key or the door.

But how to get to the ""stop"" rule at 1 left, 3 up from Baba's position (4 left, 2 down). The distance is 3 steps left and 1 step up. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at 1 step right and 3 step up there's a wall. So moving left from 4 left to 1 left would pass through positions 3 left, 2 left, 1 left. But at each step, there might be walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's look at all the text blocks. There's a ""baba is you"" rule at 2 down, and ""key is win"" at 4 right,4 up. The ""is"" blocks are movable. Maybe I can create a new rule like ""baba is win"" by rearranging the ""is"" and ""you"" blocks.

The ""you"" block is at 2 right, 2 down. The ""is"" block is at 5 right,4 up (part of ""key is win""). If I can move the ""is"" block down to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"", that could create ""baba is win"". Let's see. Moving the ""is"" from 5 right,4 up to, say, 3 step to the left and 2 steps down (where the ""you"" is). But I need to navigate there.

Baba's current position is 4 left, 2 down. To reach the ""is"" block at 5 right,4 up, that's a distance of 9 steps right and 2 steps up. But the path is blocked by walls. So this seems impossible.

Another approach: The door is at 5 right, 2 down. If I can make the door into a win condition, but the rule is ""key is win"". Maybe if I remove the ""key is win"" rule, then the default win might be the door. But how to remove that rule. To do that, I need to move the ""is"" block that's part of ""key is win"". The ""is"" is at 5 right,4 up. If I can move that ""is"" block away, then the rule ""key is win"" would be broken, and maybe the default win is the door.

But moving that ""is"" block requires getting there, which is blocked by walls. Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that makes Baba win by default. For example, ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to have ""baba"" ""is"" ""win"" as text blocks adjacent. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right,4 up. The ""is"" block is at 5 right,4 up. So if I can move the ""is"" from 5 right,4 up to between ""baba"" and ""win"", that would create the rule.

But ""baba"" is a rule at 2 down. So the positions are:

- ""baba"" rule: 4 left, 2 down (the text ""baba"" is part of the rule ""baba is you"", which is at 2 step left and 2 steps down).

Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down"", which I think means the text block ""baba"" is at that position, and it's part of the rule ""baba is you"".

To create ""baba is win"", I need the ""baba"" text, an ""is"" text, and a ""win"" text adjacent. The ""win"" text is at 6 right,4 up. The ""is"" text is at 5 right,4 up. The ""baba"" text is at 4 left,2 down. It's a long way apart. Maybe impossible to move all those blocks given the walls.

Alternatively, focus on the key. Since the key is win, maybe I can pick up the key. But to pick up the key, I need to be adjacent to it. The key is at 4 right,1 down. From Baba's position (4 left,2 down), moving right 8 steps and down 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls on the right side starting at 1 right,4 up and going down. So even if I could move through the walls (which are stop), I can't because they're stop.

Wait, but the walls are only stop if the ""stop"" rule is active. If I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the walls become passable. So the plan is:

1. Move the ""stop"" rule (at 1 left,3 up) to a different position, so the wall at 1 left,3 up is no longer stop.
2. Then navigate around the walls to reach the key or door.

But how to move the ""stop"" rule. Let's see. The ""stop"" rule is a text block at 1 left,3 up. To move it, I need to be adjacent to it and move in a direction. Baba is at 4 left,2 down. The distance to the ""stop"" rule is 3 steps left and 1 step up. But the path is blocked by walls. For example, at 1 step right and 3 step up there's a wall. So moving left from 4 left to 1 left would require passing through positions 3 left, 2 left, 1 left, but each step might have walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different text block that can be moved to create a path. For example, the ""is"" block at 5 right,4 up. But again, the path is blocked.

This is really challenging. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that by rearranging the rules, you can make yourself win without touching the key. For example, changing ""baba is you"" to ""baba is win"", but how?

The ""you"" block is at 2 right,2 down. The ""is"" block is at 5 right,4 up. If I can move the ""is"" block down to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"". Let's see. ""baba"" is at 4 left,2 down. To get the ""is"" block there, need to move it left 9 steps and down 2 steps. That's impossible due to walls.

Alternatively, maybe use the existing ""is"" block that's part of ""key is win"". If I can break that rule by moving the ""is"" block away, then the key is no longer win. But the door is at 5 right,2 down. If the default win is the door, then maybe reaching it would work. But how to remove the ""key is win"" rule.

To break the ""key is win"" rule, I need to move the ""is"" block that's between ""key"" and ""win"". That ""is"" is at 5 right,4 up. Moving it to another position would break the rule. Once that's done, if the default win is the door, then reaching the door would win the level.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""is"" block from 5 right,4 up to elsewhere, breaking ""key is win"".
2. Then move to the door at 5 right,2 down.

But how to move the ""is"" block. From Baba's position, it's 9 steps right and 2 steps up. Again, blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the ""you"" block to move. Since Baba is you, you can move text blocks. The ""you"" block is at 2 right,2 down. If I can move that ""you"" block to connect with something else.

For example, creating ""baba is you win"" or changing the ""you"" to something else. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: The door is at 5 right,2 down. The active rule is ""key is win"", so touching the key wins. But the key is behind walls. Alternatively, if I can make the door the win condition by removing the ""key is win"" rule. Once that's done, reaching the door would win.

To remove ""key is win"", need to move the ""is"" block between key and win. That ""is"" is at 5 right,4 up. How to get there?

Maybe the solution is to move the ""is"" block from 5 right,4 up to a different position, like next to ""baba"" and ""win"" to create ""baba is win"".

But the positions are:

- ""baba"" rule: 4 left,2 down (text ""baba"" is there)
- ""win"" rule:6 right,4 up (text ""win"" is there)
- ""is"" block:5 right,4 up

So to create ""baba is win"", need to have ""baba"" ""is"" ""win"" adjacent. The current ""is"" is between ""key"" and ""win"". If I move that ""is"" block left to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"", but the distance is too great.

Alternatively, move the ""win"" block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"". But the ""win"" block is at 6 right,4 up. Moving it left 1 step to 5 right,4 up would be adjacent to the ""is"" block. Then the rule would be ""key is win"" (original) and ""baba is win"" if the ""is"" is moved.

Wait, the ""is"" block is at 5 right,4 up. If I move it to 4 right,4 up (next to ""win"" at 6 right,4 up), then the rule would be ""win is key""? No, that doesn't make sense. The order matters. The rule is ""[Subject] IS [Property]"". So the subject is to the left of the ""is"", and the property to the right.

So if the ""is"" block is between ""baba"" and ""win"", then it would create ""baba is win"". But the current setup has ""key is win"", with ""is"" between ""key"" and ""win"".

To create ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"" on the left, ""is"" in the middle, and ""win"" on the right, all adjacent.

The ""baba"" text is at 4 left,2 down. The ""win"" text is at 6 right,4 up. The ""is"" text is at 5 right,4 up. It's a far distance, but perhaps possible if the path is clear.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""win"" text block to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"". But moving the ""win"" block would require it to be movable. Since ""win"" is part of the ""key is win"" rule, but there's no rule making it stop. So it's movable.

So steps:

1. Move the ""win"" block from 6 right,4 up to a position next to ""baba"" and ""is"".
2. Arrange them as ""baba is win"".

But how to navigate there. Baba is at 4 left,2 down. To reach the ""win"" block at 6 right,4 up, it's a long way. Passable only if walls are not stop.

Alternatively, if we can remove the stop property from the walls, then we can path through.

This is getting really complicated. Maybe the intended solution is to realize that by moving the ""you"" block, you can make yourself win. For example, creating ""baba is you win"" or changing the ""you"" to ""win"".

The ""you"" block is at 2 right,2 down. If I can move it to connect with ""baba"" and ""win"", creating ""baba you win"", but that doesn","

Let me try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, normally, the goal is to get the key because it's defined as win. But since Baba is me, maybe I need to reach the key to win. The door is at door 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down, which is closer. However, there are walls blocking the path. Looking at the map:

Looking at the objects, the walls are aligned to the right side. The key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from the current position. But the path might be blocked by walls. Let me check the positions again.

The wall is at 1 step to the right, 2 steps up, 1 step up, etc. So moving down to the key's location, there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. Wait, the current position of Baba is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the coordinates.

Wait, the user might be using a coordinate system where each step is relative. The active rules and objects have positions described like ""4 step to the left and 4 step up"". So, perhaps the player (Baba) is at a certain position, and other objects are placed relative to that.

Assuming that the player's position is somewhere, the key is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So moving right towards the key might be blocked by walls. Let me visualize the grid.

Alternatively, maybe the way to get the key is to rearrange the rules. Since the key is win, maybe I need to change the rule so that door becomes win instead. But how? The rules are on the map as text blocks. The current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can move the ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"", then ""door is win"". But where are the text blocks?

Looking at the objects, there's a rule `win` at 6 steps right, 4 up. rule `is` at 5 steps right, 4 up. So the ""key is win"" rule is made by rule `key` at 4 right,4 up connected to rule `is` at 5 right,4 up, then rule `win` at 6 right,4 up. To create a new rule, say ""door is win"", I need to move the existing ""is"" next to door and win. But the door is at 5 steps right, 2 steps down. The ""win"" rule is at 6 right,4 up. That's a long distance. Maybe it's not feasible.

Alternatively, maybe make ""baba is win"" so that touching the door (which is win) makes me win. But how? The existing rule is ""baba is you"". To change that, I need to move the ""is"" between baba and you. The rule `baba` is at 4 left, 2 down, rule `is` at 3 left, 2 down, and rule `you` at 2 left, 2 down. So ""baba is you"". To make ""baba is win"", I would need to replace ""you"" with ""win"". But the ""win"" rule is at 6 right,4 up, which is far away.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""is"" next to baba and win. But the ""is"" is already used in ""key is win"". If I break that rule by moving the ""is"" away, then ""key is win"" would be invalid. Then, perhaps create a new rule ""baba is win"". Let's see. The current ""is"" is at 5 steps right,4 up (part of key is win). If I move that ""is"" to be next to baba and win, that could work. But how to physically move it?

The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So perhaps the player's position is at 4 left, 2 down, and the ""is"" needed is at 3 left, 2 down (current position of the ""is"" that's part of ""baba is you""). To create ""baba is win"", I need to have ""baba"" next to ""is"" and then ""win"". The ""win"" rule is at 6 right,4 up, which is far to the right and up. That might not be reachable in one move.

Alternatively, maybe pick up the ""is"" text block and move it to connect baba and win. But the player has to move towards those objects. Let's see the positions:

- The ""is"" needed is at 5 steps right,4 up (part of key is win).
- The ""win"" rule is at 6 steps right,4 up.
- The ""baba"" rule is at 4 steps left,2 down.

So, moving from the player's position (4 left,2 down) to the ""is"" at 5 right,4 up would require moving right and up, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, wall at 1 step right,4 up, and others. It's a maze.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the way to go. The key is at 4 steps right,1 down. The player is at 4 left,2 down. So to get to the key, need to move right 8 steps and down 1 step. But the path is blocked by walls. Let's check:

From the player's position (4 left,2 down), moving right towards the key. But between them, there are walls at 1 step right,4 up; 1 step right,3 up; etc. Wait, the walls are on the upper right side. The key is at 4 right,1 down, which is below the player. So maybe moving down towards the key. But the player's current position is 4 left and 2 down. The key is 4 right and 1 down. So relative movement: right 8 steps and down 1. But the path is blocked by walls at 1 step right, and lower steps.

Alternatively, maybe pushing a wall? But the rules say that STOP properties can't be moved. The walls here are probably STOP. So can't push them.

Hmm. Another approach: since the key is WIN, picking it up would make me WIN. So if I can reach the key, then I win. The key is at 4 steps right,1 down. The player's position is 4 left,2 down. So moving right 8 steps and down 1. But how to navigate past the walls.

Looking at the map:

- There's a wall at 1 step right,4 up; same for 2,3,4 steps up. So the upper right is blocked.
- The lower right has walls at 1 step right,2 down; 1 step right,1 down; etc. Wait, the wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down is present. So the path to the key (which is 4 right,1 down) is blocked by walls at 1 right,2 down and others.

Wait, the player is at 4 left,2 down. To get to the key at 4 right,1 down, the direct path is right 8 steps and down 1. But between the player and the key, there's a wall at 1 step right,2 down (same as the player's position's right neighbor). So moving right once would hit a wall. Therefore, can't go that way.

Alternative route: maybe move around the walls. But the walls are spread out. For example, moving up past the upper walls, then right, then down. But the upper right is blocked by walls at 1 step right,4 up and others. So maybe not possible.

Another idea: use the existing rules to change the game. If I can make ""baba is win"", then touching anything win (like the door) would make me win. But how to create that rule.

The current rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The ""is"" text blocks are at 5 right,4 up (part of key is win) and 3 left,2 down (part of baba is you). To create ""baba is win"", I need to connect baba, is, win.

The ""win"" is at 6 right,4 up. The ""is"" needed is at 5 right,4 up (from key is win). If I can move that ""is"" to be next to baba and win.

But the player is at 4 left,2 down. To reach the ""is"" at 5 right,4 up, the player would have to move right 9 steps and up 2 steps, but there are walls blocking the way. For example, at 1 step right,4 up there's a wall. So that path is blocked.

Alternatively, maybe move the ""you"" text block. The ""you"" is at 2 left,2 down. If I can move ""you"" to somewhere else. But not sure how that helps.

Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". If I can break ""baba is you"" by moving the ""is"" away, then baba would just be an object with no properties. Then, maybe create a new rule like ""baba is win"". But to do that, I need to have the ""is"" text block next to baba and win.

But the ""is"" is currently part of ""key is win"". If I move that ""is"" to connect baba and win, then ""key is win"" would be broken, and ""baba is win"" would be created. That might work.

So the steps would be:

1. Move the ""is"" text block (at 5 right,4 up) down and left to connect with baba (4 left,2 down) and win (6 right,4 up).

But how to physically move the ""is"" block. The player (Baba) is at 4 left,2 down. To get to the ""is"" at 5 right,4 up, need to move right 9 and up 2, but walls are in the way.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different ""is"" block. Looking at the objects, there's another ""is"" at 3 step to the left and 3 step up (rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up). Wait, no, in the current observation, the objects are:

rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 4 step up

wall 4 step up

rule `key` 3 steps to the right and 4 step up

rule `is` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up

rule `win` 5 steps to the right and 4 step up

rule `is` 3 step to the left and 3 step up

rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up

wall 3 step up

wall 2 step up

wall 1 step up

wall 1 step down

key 3 steps to the right and 1 step down

rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down

rule `is` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down

rule `you` 3 step to the left and 2 steps down

wall 2 steps down

door 4 steps to the right and 2 steps down

Wait, there are multiple ""is"" blocks. The main ""is"" for key is win is at 4 steps right,4 up. Another ""is"" is at 3 step left and 3 step up. And another at 4 step left and 2 step down (part of baba is you).

So maybe the player can use the ""is"" at 4 step left and 2 step down (which is part of baba is you) to create a new rule. If they move that ""is"" next to win, then it becomes baba is win? Wait, no. The existing rule is baba is you, connected by is. If you move the ""is"" to connect baba to win, then it would be baba is win, making the existing rule invalid.

So the plan is: take the ""is"" from baba is you (at 4 left,2 down) and move it next to win (5 right,4 up) and baba (5 left,2 down). But how?

The player is at rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player's position is 5 left,2 down. The ""is"" block is at 4 left,2 down (adjacent to baba). The win rule is at 5 right,4 up. So to move the ""is"" block from 4 left,2 down to be between baba (5 left,2 down) and win (5 right,4 up), the player would need to carry the ""is"" block and move it there.

But the movement is step by step. Let's see:

1. Move right from player's position (5 left,2 down) to the ""is"" at 4 left,2 down. That's one step right.

2. Pick up the ""is"" block (assuming you can move it since it's not STOP).

3. Move the ""is"" block up and right to connect with win at 5 right,4 up and baba at 5 left,2 down. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe drop the ""is"" next to win. But win is at 5 right,4 up, which is far away.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: since the key is WIN, and it's at 4 right,1 down, perhaps the player can reach it by moving down and right, avoiding walls.

The player is at 5 left,2 down. To reach the key at 4 right,1 down:

Movement needed: right 9 steps, down 1 step.

But the path is blocked by walls at 1 step right (multiple walls upwards and downwards). For example, at 1 step right,2 down is a wall. So moving right from 5 left,2 down (player's position) to 4 left,2 down (baba's rule), then right to 3 left,2 down (you), then right to 2 left,2 down (is), then right to 1 left,2 down (wall). So stuck.

Alternative path: move up first, then right, then down. But upper path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, move down to 5 left,3 down, then right. But looking at the map, there's a wall at 1 step right,3 step up, but not sure about lower positions.

This is tricky. Maybe the solution is to rearrange the rules. Since the key is win, and it's located at 4 right,1 down, perhaps the player needs to push the key towards themselves. But can't push STOP objects.

Alternatively, maybe the door is the real win condition, but it's behind a wall. The door is at 4 right,2 down. There's a wall at 2 steps down,1 right. So to get to the door, need to move right past the wall. But the wall is STOP, so can't push.

Alternatively, change the door's rule to be win. But how?

Another idea: Since ""key is win"", picking up the key makes you win. So if the player can reach the key, they win. But the path is blocked. Maybe there's a way to move the walls by rearranging rules.

Wait, the walls are defined as ""wall is stop"". If I can change the property of the wall, then it can be moved. For example, make ""wall is you"", then it becomes a movable object. But how?

To do that, need to create a new rule like ""wall is you"" by moving the ""is"" next to wall and you. But the ""you"" is currently part of ""baba is you"". If I move the ""you"" elsewhere, then...

But the player is holding the ""is"" block (from earlier steps). If they can create a new rule ""wall is you"", then the walls become movable. Then, the player can push them aside.

So steps:

1. Move the ""is"" block from baba is you to wall and you.

But where is the ""you"" block? The ""you"" is at 3 step left,2 down. The wall is at 5 step left,4 up.

This seems very complex. Maybe the intended solution is to move the ""is"" block next to key and win to make ""key is win"" (already exists), but that doesn't help. Alternatively, create ""door is win"".

But the door is at 4 right,2 down. The ""win"" is at 5 right,4 up. The ""is"" is at 4 right,4 up. So to make ""door is win"", need to move the ""is"" from 4 right,4 up to be between door (4 right,2 down) and win (5 right,4 up). That would require moving the ""is"" down 2 steps and left 0, then up 2 steps. But the path is blocked by walls.

Alternatively, maybe this level requires a different approach. Since the key is win, and it's located at a certain position, perhaps the solution is to navigate around the walls to reach it by moving the text blocks.

But given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, maybe the correct action here is to move down towards the key, even though the path is blocked, but perhaps there's a way through.

Alternatively, maybe the player needs to move the ""is"" block that's part of ""baba is you"" to connect to ""win"", making ""baba is win"". Let's try that.

The ""is"" block is at 4 step left and 2 step down. The ""win"" is at 5 step right and 4 step up. The player is at 5 step left and 2 step down.

So the player needs to move from 5L,2D to 4L,2D (the ""is"" block), pick it up, then move right and up to connect with ""win"".

Movement steps:

1. Move right once to reach the ""is"" block.

2. Pick up the ""is"" block (assuming you can carry it).

3. Move up and right to place it next to ""win"" and ""baba"".

But the path from 4L,2D to 5R,4U is blocked by walls. For example, moving right from 4L,2D would go to 3L,2D (you), then 2L,2D (is), then 1","

I need to figure out the next move in this Baba Is You level. Let's start by looking at the current observation again.

The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key, which is currently acting as the win condition. But wait, usually the door is the win, but here the key itself is the win. Interesting. So my goal is to reach the key, which is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from my current position. 

Looking at the objects on the map, I see that there's a door at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But since the key is the win, maybe I don't need the door. Let me check the positions again. The key is at (4 right, 1 down), and I'm probably at the starting position, maybe near the left side. The walls are arranged in a way that there might be a path to the key. 

The walls are positioned such that from the top, there are walls on the left and right sides, but maybe there's a corridor in the middle. The key is one step down from the key rule, which is at 4 steps right. So to get to the key, I need to move right four times. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 4 steps up. Wait, no, the walls are at different positions. Let's map this out.

Currently, the walls are:
- 4 steps left and 4 up (so that's a wall in the upper left)
- 1 step right and 4 up (another wall on the upper right)
Then, moving down, there are walls at 1 step right, 3 step up, 2 step up, 1 step up, and then 1 step right at ground level. Also, at 1 step right and 1 step down, there's another wall. 

The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. So if I move right from my current position, past the wall at 1 step right, but wait, can I pass walls? The rules say that objects with ""STOP"" can't be moved through. Looking at the active rules, ""stop"" is defined by the rule at 1 step left and 3 step up: ""stop 1 step to the right and 3 step up"". So that wall is a STOP, meaning I can't move into it or push it if it's blocking. 

But since the rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"", I can move objects that aren't STOP. So the walls that are STOP are immovable. Let me see the path from where I am (probably near the baba rule at 4 left and 2 down) to the key. 

If I'm at 4 left and 2 down (where the ""baba is you"" rule is), to get to the key at 4 right and 1 down, I need to move right four times and down one. But the wall at 1 step right might block the way. Wait, the walls at 1 step right are at various levels. Let's see:

- At 1 step right and 4 up: wall (STOP)
- At 1 step right and 3 up: wall (STOP)
- At 1 step right and 2 up: wall (but not STOP?)
Wait, the rule ""stop"" is only at 1 step left and 3 step up, which points to the wall at 1 step right and 3 step up. So that wall is STOP. The other walls at 1 step right and 2 up, 1 up, etc., are not STOP, so maybe I can move past them? 

But how do I navigate? Let's think step by step. Starting from my position (rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down), which would be at coordinates (assuming left is negative x, right is positive x, up is positive y, down is negative y). Let's say I'm at ( -4, -2 ). The key is at (4, -1). 

The path to the key would require moving right to x=4, y=-1. But between x=-4 and x=4, there's a wall at x=1, y=4 (which is a STOP), and walls descending from there. To avoid the STOP wall at x=1, y=3, maybe I need to go around. But how? 

Looking at the map, the walls on the right side are from x=1 upwards. So from x=1 to x=6 (the key is at x=4, but the rule is at x=5 for the win), there's a structure of walls. Maybe the path is to go around the left side? But the left side has a wall at x=-4, y=4. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can push some objects. Since the walls that are not STOP can be moved. For example, the walls at 1 step right and 2 step up, 1 step up, etc., are not STOP, so I can move them. But how does pushing work in Baba Is You? You have to push an object in the direction you're moving, right? So if I'm next to a non-STOP wall, I can push it by moving towards it. 

Wait, my current position is at the ""baba is you"" rule, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down from where? Maybe the starting position is where the player is, which is likely near the baba rule. Let me assume that the player is at the position of the ""baba"" rule, which is 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So coordinates (-4, -2). 

The key is at (4, -1). So I need to move right 8 steps? But there are walls blocking. Let's see:

From (-4, -2), moving right: first step to (-3, -2). Then (-2, -2), (-1, -2). But at x=-1, y=-2, is there a wall? According to the objects, the walls on the right side start at x=1, so maybe the left side is clear. So moving right from x=-4 to x=0, then x=1. But at x=1, y=-2, there's a wall (wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down). But that wall's rule is not STOP, so I can push it. 

Wait, the wall at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down is a regular wall (not STOP), so I can move it. So if I move right into that wall, I can push it. For example, if I'm at (0, -2) and move right, pushing the wall at (1, -2) to (2, -2). Then I can proceed further. 

But this might take several steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to reposition the rules to change the stop condition. For example, if I can move the ""stop"" rule away, then the walls would no longer be STOP. 

Looking at the active rules: ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's also a ""stop"" rule at 2 step left and 3 step up, which points to a wall at 1 step right and 3 step up. If I can move that ""stop"" rule, then the wall at (1,3) would no longer be STOP, allowing me to pass through. 

To move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it and move it. The ""stop"" rule is located 2 steps left and 3 steps up from where? Assuming the ""baba is you"" rule is at (-4, -2), then the ""stop"" rule would be at (-4 -2 = -6, -2 +3 = 1). So coordinates (-6, 1). The wall it's pointing to is at (1,3). 

But how do I get to the ""stop"" rule at (-6,1)? That's quite far from my current position at (-4, -2). Moving left two steps and up three steps. But there might be walls in the way. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find another way. Let's think again. The key is at (4, -1), which is 4 steps right and 1 step down from my current position. The direct path is blocked by the STOP wall at (1,3), but if I can remove the STOP property from that wall, then I can move through. 

To do that, I need to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at (2 step left and 3 step up from where? Maybe from the baba rule's position. So if the baba rule is at (-4, -2), then moving 2 steps left would be (-6, -2), and 3 steps up would be (-6,1). So the ""stop"" rule is at (-6,1), pointing to the wall at (1,3). 

To move the ""stop"" rule, I have to be adjacent to it and push it. Let's see: from my position at (-4, -2), how to reach (-6,1). That's left two steps and up three. But the path might be blocked. Let's check the walls. 

From (-4, -2) to (-5, -2) to (-6, -2): is there a wall there? According to the objects, the wall at 4 step left and 4 step up is a different wall. The walls on the left side are at 4 step left and 4 up, but not in the lower areas. So maybe moving left two steps is possible. Then up three steps from (-6, -2) to (-6,1). But along the way, are there any walls? 

Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 4 step left and 4 up, which is way above. The other walls are on the right side. So the left path from (-4, -2) to (-6,1) might be clear. If I can move left two steps to (-6, -2), then up three steps to (-6,1), where the ""stop"" rule is located. Then, I can move the ""stop"" rule somewhere else to remove the STOP property. 

But to move the ""stop"" rule, I need to be adjacent to it. So at (-6,1), if I move the rule, I can push it to an adjacent tile. For example, moving it down to (-6,0), which would change the ""stop"" rule's position, but not its effect. Wait, the ""stop"" rule is ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". If I move this rule, say, to the right by one step, it becomes ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the left and 3 step up"", which would point to a different wall. But I need to make sure that the wall it's pointing to is no longer a problem. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""stop"" rule so that it doesn't point to any wall, then the STOP property would be removed. For example, moving the ""stop"" rule off the grid. But in Baba Is You, you can only move text blocks to adjacent tiles, not off the map. 

Alternatively, maybe create a new rule that negates the STOP property. For example, ""stop is not stop"", but that's probably not possible in the current setup. 

Another approach: since the key is the win, maybe I don't need to avoid walls. If I can reach the key, even if it's behind walls, but the rules say that if you touch the key, you win. But if the key is behind a STOP wall, you can't touch it. So I need to remove the STOP from the wall blocking the path. 

So back to the plan: move the ""stop"" rule to remove the STOP property from the wall at (1,3). To do that, I need to reach the ""stop"" rule at (-6,1) and move it. 

From my current position (-4, -2), moving left two steps to (-6, -2), then up three steps to (-6,1). Each move must be valid. Let's check if there are any walls along this path. 

From (-4, -2) to (-5, -2): no wall mentioned there. 
From (-5, -2) to (-6, -2): same. 
Then up to (-6, -1), (-6,0), (-6,1). No walls mentioned in these positions. So this path should be clear. 

Once at (-6,1), the ""stop"" rule is there. I can then move this rule. Possible directions: left, right, up, down. Let's say I move it to the right to (-5,1). The rule would then be ""rule `stop` 2 steps to the left and 3 step up"", which points to a different position. But does this remove the STOP from the original wall? 

Not sure. Alternatively, moving the ""stop"" rule down to (-6,0). The rule would then be ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"", pointing to a different wall. Maybe this removes the STOP from the wall at (1,3). 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the ""stop"" rule so that it doesn't point to any wall. For example, moving it to a position where its target is empty. But in this level, the walls are specifically placed, so it's hard to aim. 

Another idea: instead of moving the ""stop"" rule, create a new rule that changes the wall's property. For example, ""wall is not stop"". But to create that, I need to manipulate the existing rules. 

The existing rules are ""key is win"", ""baba is you"", ""stop 1 step to the left and 3 step up"", and others. If I can move the ""is"" rule that connects ""stop"" to the wall, I might be able to redefine it. 

The ""stop"" rule is formed by ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". This is a combination of the ""is"" rule at 2 step left and 3 step up (which is ""rule `is` 2 step left and 3 step up"") and the wall at 1 step right and 3 step up. 

So to change what ""stop"" means, I need to move either the ""is"" rule or the wall. 

If I move the ""is"" rule that defines ""stop"", then the connection changes. For example, if I move the ""is"" rule at 2 step left and 3 step up to a different position, the ""stop"" rule would point to a different object. 

Alternatively, move the wall that is targeted by the ""stop"" rule. The wall at 1 step right and 3 step up is a STOP. If I can move that wall, maybe it's no longer in the path. 

But the wall at 1 step right and 3 step up is a STOP, so I can't move it unless I first remove the STOP property. This seems circular. 

Wait, the wall at 1 step right and 3 step up is a STOP because of the ""stop"" rule. If I can move the ""stop"" rule, then that wall is no longer STOP. So the key is to move the ""stop"" rule. 

Going back, to reach the ""stop"" rule at (-6,1), I need to navigate there. From (-4, -2), move left two steps to (-6, -2), then up three steps to (-6,1). Each move should be possible if there are no walls in the way. 

Assuming there are no walls along that path, I can move there. Then, move the ""stop"" rule. Let's say I move it to the right to (-5,1). Now, the ""stop"" rule would be ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"", which points to a different wall. Maybe this removes the STOP from the original wall at (1,3). 

Alternatively, move the ""stop"" rule down to (-6,0). Then the rule becomes ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 2 step up"", pointing to a wall at (0,2), which might not be in the way. 

Either way, the original wall at (1,3) would no longer be a STOP, allowing me to pass through. 

Once the wall is no longer STOP, I can move right past x=1 and reach the key. 

So the steps would be:
1. Move from current position (-4, -2) left to (-6, -2).
2. Move up to (-6,1) to reach the ""stop"" rule.
3. Move the ""stop"" rule to a new position, removing its reference to the wall at (1,3).
4. Now, the wall at (1,3) is no longer STOP, so I can path through.
5. Move right past x=1, avoiding other walls, to reach the key at (4, -1).

But this requires several moves and precise navigation. Alternatively, maybe there's a shorter path. 

Alternatively, since the key is the win, maybe I can push the key towards me. The key is a rule ""key is win"", so if I can move the ""key"" rule, I can bring the win condition to me. 

The ""key"" rule is at 4 steps right and 4 steps up from somewhere. Wait, in the current observation, the ""key"" rule is at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the baba rule's position. If the baba rule is at (-4, -2), then the ""key"" rule is at (-4 +4, -2 +4) = (0,2). So the ""key"" rule is at (0,2), and the actual key object is at (4 steps right and 4 up from the rule? No, the rule says ""key is win"", so the key's position is separate. The key object is at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from the baba rule's position. Wait, the key object is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from where? According to the observation, the key is 4 steps to the right and 1 step down. If the baba rule is at (-4, -2), then the key is at (-4 +4, -2 -1) = (0, -3). But that doesn't seem right. Maybe the coordinates are relative to the rule's position. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to visualize the map based on the observation. 

The active rules are:
- key is win: this rule is somewhere on the map, probably at a certain coordinate.
- baba is you: this rule is also on the map, likely at another coordinate.

63,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is to get the key because it's considered a win now. But usually, the win condition is a door or something else, but here the key itself is the win. So maybe grabbing the key is the way to go.

Looking at the objects on the map, the key is located at 4 steps to the right and 1 step down from the current position. There are walls blocking the path. The door is at 5 steps to the right and 2 steps down, but since the key is the win, maybe I don't need to go to the door. 

Wait, the rules say ""key is win"", so picking up the key should make the player win. But how do you pick it up? In Baba Is You, you usually move onto an object to interact with it if there's a rule allowing it. Since ""baba is you"", the player is Baba. The key is a separate object. To get the key, maybe I need to move right towards it. But there's a wall at 1 step to the right and 4 step up, and other walls below. The path to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step down seems blocked by walls. 

Wait, let me check the positions again. The current position isn't specified, but looking at the objects, the key is at 4 right, 1 down. The player (Baba) is probably at a different location. The rules for Baba are ""baba is you"" and ""is"" and ""you"" are placed to form those rules. Maybe the player needs to move towards the key, but the way is blocked by walls. The walls are at various positions, like 1 step right, 2 step up, etc. 

If the key is 4 steps to the right and 1 down, and the player is maybe at a position that allows moving right, perhaps the action is to move right multiple times. But each time, there's a wall blocking. Wait, noâ€”the walls are at specific positions. Let me visualize the map.

Assuming the player is at a starting point, maybe the key is to the right. The walls are in the way, but perhaps there's a way around. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to rearrange the rules to bypass the walls. For example, if there's a ""stop"" rule, maybe creating a new rule to remove ""stop"" from walls. 

Looking at the active rules, there's ""stop"" at 1 step left and 3 step up. If the player can move that ""stop"" text block and reposition it, maybe they can make the walls not stop. But the player is Baba, and if the walls are defined as ""stop"", they can't move them unless the rule allowing movement is changed. 

Alternatively, since ""baba is you"", the player can move any object that's not stopped. So if the walls are stopped, the player can't push them. But maybe the player can move text blocks to change the rules. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, but in the current active rules, it's ""stop"" as a separate rule. Wait, the active rules are ""key is win"", ""baba is you"", and then there's a ""rule `stop` 1 step to the left and 3 step up"". So the ""stop"" property is at that position. If the player can move that ""stop"" rule somewhere else, then the walls wouldn't be stopped anymore. 

So the plan could be: move the ""stop"" rule to a different location, making the walls not stop. Then, pathfind to the key. But how to do that? The player needs to move the ""stop"" text block. Since the player is Baba, and if they can move objects that are not stopped, but the ""stop"" rule itself is a text block. If the ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up, can the player move that text block? 

If the ""stop"" rule is part of the active rules, then moving it would change the game rules. So the player would need to grab the ""stop"" text block and move it elsewhere. For example, move it down or to the side so that the walls no longer have the ""stop"" property. Once the walls are no longer stopped, the player can push them or move around them. 

Alternatively, maybe the player can create a new rule like ""wall is push"" or something else, but that requires moving text blocks like ""is"" and ""push"". 

But the immediate goal is to get to the key. Let's think step by step. The key is at 4 right, 1 down. Current position isn't specified, but assuming the player is near the left side. To move right 4 steps, but there's a wall at 1 step right. So the player can't go straight right. Maybe need to move around the wall. But the walls are stacked vertically at 1 step right, from 4 step up down to 1 step down. So there's a vertical wall on the right side. The key is below that wall, at 4 right, 1 down. So to get to the key, the player might need to go around the wall either by going up or down, but the wall is from 4 up to 1 down. 

Wait, the wall at 1 step right is at 4 step up, then another wall at 3 step up, 2 step up, etc., down to 1 step down. So it's a solid wall on the right side from 4 up to 1 down. The key is at 4 right, 1 down, which is at the bottom of that wall. So to reach the key, the player would have to go around the wall, but the wall is solid. Unless there's a way to move the wall by changing the rules. 

Alternatively, since the key is the win condition, maybe just moving onto the key is enough. But if the path is blocked, the player can't get there. So the solution must involve changing the rules to remove the walls' stop property. 

To do that, the player needs to move the ""stop"" rule. The ""stop"" rule is at 1 step left and 3 step up. The player (Baba) is at rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So the player's position is 4 left, 2 down. The ""stop"" rule is 1 left, 3 up. To reach it, the player needs to move left and up. But moving left from 4 left would take them further left, but the ""stop"" rule is at 1 left, which is closer. Wait, positions are relative. Maybe the player is at the origin, and the other objects are positioned relative to that. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to map it out. 

Assuming the player is at (0,0). Then:

- rule `wall` is at 4 left, 4 up: so position (-4,4)
- wall at 1 right, 4 up: (1,4)
- rule `key` at 4 right,4 up: (4,4)
- rule `is` at 5 right,4 up: (5,4)
- rule `win` at 6 right,4 up: (6,4)
- rule `is` at 2 left,3 up: (-2,3)
- rule `stop` at 1 left,3 up: (-1,3)
- walls at 1 right,3 up: (1,3), and similarly down to (1,1)
- key at 4 right,1 down: (4,-1)
- rule `baba` at 4 left,2 down: (-4,-2)
- other rules and walls below.

So the player is at (-4,-2). The key is at (4,-1). The path to the key is blocked by a wall from (1,4) down to (1,-1). To get to (4,-1), the player needs to go around the wall at x=1. But how? 

If the player can change the ""stop"" rule, then the walls at x=1 wouldn't be stoppable. The ""stop"" rule is at (-1,3). If the player can move that text block, say, to somewhere else, then the walls wouldn't have the stop property. 

To move the ""stop"" rule, the player needs to be adjacent to it and move it in a direction. Since the player is at (-4,-2), they need to navigate to (-1,3). The path there is clear except for possible other walls. Let's see:

From (-4,-2), moving right 3 steps to get to x=-1, but there's a wall at x=1,4 up, but that's not in the way. Wait, the walls at x=1 are from y=4 down to y=1, but the player is at y=-2. So moving right from (-4,-2) to (-1,-2) is possible unless there's a wall there. Looking at the objects, there's no wall at x=-1, y=-2. So the player can move right towards (-1,-2), then up to (-1,3) where the ""stop"" rule is. 

Once the player is at (-1,3), they can pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it. For example, moving it down to (-1,2), which would remove the stop property from the walls. Then the walls at x=1 wouldn't be stoppable, allowing the player to move around them. 

After moving the ""stop"" rule, the player can then go to the key at (4,-1). But the path from (-1,3) to (4,-1) would require moving right and down, avoiding the now non-stop walls. 

Alternatively, once the stop is removed, the player can push the walls if needed. But since the walls are no longer stop, maybe they can be moved. But the key is at (4,-1), which is below the wall at (1,-1). So moving right from x=1 to x=4 would require passing through x=2,3,4. If the walls at x=1 are no longer stop, the player can move through them. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move from player's position (-4,-2) to (-1,3) to get to the ""stop"" rule.
2. Pick up the ""stop"" rule and move it somewhere else, say to (-1,2).
3. Now, the walls at x=1 no longer have the stop property.
4. Move right from (-1,2) towards the key at (4,-1), avoiding the walls or moving through them since they're not stopping.

But how to execute this in the game? Each move is a single step. The player needs to navigate to the ""stop"" rule, which is at (-1,3). From (-4,-2):

- Move right 3 times: right, right, right â†’ (-3,-2), (-2,-2), (-1,-2)
- Then move up 1 step: up â†’ (-1,-1)
- Then up again: up â†’ (-1,0)
- Up again: up â†’ (-1,1)
- Up again: up â†’ (-1,2)
Wait, that's only 4 steps up from (-1,-2) to (-1,2). But the ""stop"" rule is at (-1,3). So need to move up once more: up â†’ (-1,3)

Now at the ""stop"" rule. Then, move the ""stop"" rule. To move a text block, the player needs to be adjacent and then move it in a direction, attaching it to their movement. So from (-1,3), if the player moves up, they can take the ""stop"" rule with them. For example, moving up to (0,4) with the ""stop"" rule. But where to move it? Maybe move it down to (-1,2) to place it there. 

So the action would be to move up while carrying the ""stop"" rule, placing it at (-1,2). Then the active rule ""stop"" is now at (-1,2), which might not affect the walls anymore, or changes their property.

After that, the player can move right towards the key. From (-1,2), move right to (0,2), then right to (1,2), etc., down to (4,-1). 

But the key is at (4,-1), which is quite far. The player would need to navigate down from (4,2) to (4,-1), passing through x=4 at various y levels. Along the way, the walls at x=1 are no longer stop, so the player can move through them. 

Alternatively, once the stop rule is moved, the player can go directly to the key by moving right and down. 

So the key actions are moving to the ""stop"" rule, moving it, then proceeding to the key. 

But the immediate action needed is the first step. The player is currently at (-4,-2). The first move should be to right to start moving towards the ""stop"" rule at (-1,3).

64,right,"<reasoning>
Let's see what's going on here. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". That means the key becomes the win condition, and I control Baba since he's you.

Looking at the objects, Baba is at 5 steps left and 2 steps down. There's a door at 4 steps right and 2 steps down. But how do I get there? There are walls blocking the path. The key is to the right, at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Maybe I need to get the key first because ""key is win"" probably means picking it up to win. Wait, but ""key is win"" might mean that the key itself is the win object, so maybe just standing on it is enough. But in some levels, you have to touch the win object. 

So, if I go right towards the key, but there's a wall at 1 step right. Wait, let me check the map again. The walls are at positions like 1 step right at various levels. Let's visualize the layout. Baba is at (5 left, 2 down). To the right, there's a wall at 1 step right, then another at 2 steps down. The key is at 3 steps right and 1 step down. So the path to the key is blocked by a wall at 1 step right. But maybe I can move the wall? Wait, the rules say ""baba is you"", so I can push objects that aren't stop. The wall has a ""stop"" property from one of the rules, right? Let me check. There's a rule ""stop"" 2 steps left and 3 step up, but that might not affect the current walls. The walls here are just regular walls. So if they are not stop, can I push them? Wait, the active rules don't mention stop for these walls. The ""stop"" rule is probably for another wall. So maybe I can move the walls here. 

But moving the wall at 1 step right would allow me to go right. So, if I push that wall to the right, then I can move past it to get to the key. Let me see the positions again. The wall is 1 step right from Baba's current position. To push it, I need to move in the opposite direction of where I want to push it. So if I push the wall to the right, I need to move right twice: first, move right to be next to the wall, then maybe push it. Wait, but the direction to push is determined by the movement. For example, if I'm to the left of the wall and move right, the wall would move right. So from Baba's position at 5 left and 2 down, moving right once would take him to 4 left and 2 down. Then, if he moves right again, he's next to the wall at 1 step right (which is now at 4 left - 1 step right = 3 left?). Wait, maybe the coordinates are a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again.

The objects' positions are described relative to the player's position, I think. For example, ""rule `wall` 5 step to the left and 4 step up"" means that wall is 5 steps left and 4 up from where I am currently. So Baba's current position is the reference point. So, if I'm at (0,0), then the wall is at (-5,4). The key is at (4,4) for the first key rule, but wait, there are multiple keys? The key is at 4 steps right and 4 up, and another key at 3 steps right and 1 step down. Wait, looking at the objects list:

- rule `key` 4 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 6 steps to the right and 4 step up
- key 4 steps to the right and 1 step down

So there's a key up above and a key down below. The ""key is win"" rule means that either of these keys could be the win object. But probably the lower key is the one to get since it's closer. 

Baba's position is rule `baba` 4 step to the left and 2 steps down. So relative to Baba, his own position is at (0,0). The rule `baba` is at (-4, -2). That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the position is described from the player's perspective. So if the player is at (0,0), then the rule `baba` is at (-4, -2), meaning 4 steps left and 2 steps down from the player. But the player is Baba, so this might be a rule that's part of the level. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to sketch the map mentally. The player (Baba) is at the position where the rule `baba` is located: 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So if the player is at (0,0), then the rule `baba` is at (-4, -2). The actual Baba is represented by the text block ""BABA IS YOU"", which is a rule. So maybe the player is controlling the Baba entity, which is separate from the rule. 

The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the player. So if the player is at (0,0), the key is at (4, -1). There's a wall at 1 step right (so (1,0)) and another wall at 1 step down (0,-1). The door is at (4, -1), which is the same position as the key. Wait, no: the door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down, so (5, -2). 

The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So to win, I need to get the key, which is also the win object. The key is at (4, -1). But there's a wall at (1,0) blocking the path to the right. To get past the wall, I can push it if it's not a stop. The wall's properties: looking at the objects, there's a rule `stop` at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, but that's probably not relevant here. The walls mentioned are just regular walls. Since the rules don't state that these walls are stop, I can push them. 

So the plan is: move right past the wall blocking the path. To do that, I need to push the wall at (1,0) to the right. To push an object, you have to move in the direction opposite to where you want it to go. So if I'm at (0,0) and want to push the wall at (1,0) to the right to (2,0), I need to move right twice: first to (1,0) next to the wall, then move right again to push it. 

But wait, the player is Baba, who is at the position defined by the rule `baba` 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So if the player's position is (4,2) relative to the origin, then the key is at (4+4, 2-1) = (8,1)? This is getting too confusing with the coordinate system. Maybe I should focus on relative movements. 

Alternatively, think of the player as being on a grid. The key is to the right and down from Baba. There's a wall blocking the immediate path to the right. To get past the wall, push it right. So move right once to be next to the wall, then move right again to push it. Then proceed to the key. Once the key is picked up (by standing on it), the level is won because ""key is win"". 

But how do I interact with the key? In Baba Is You, usually, you have to touch the object to claim it. So moving onto the key's tile would make it active. 

So the steps would be:

1. Move right past the wall. To do this, push the wall at 1 step right. Move right to (1,0), then right again to push it to (2,0). Now the path is clear.

2. Move right to the key at (4, -1). Once there, the key is activated, and since ""key is win"", the level is won.

But wait, the key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down from the player's initial position. So after pushing the wall, move right four times? That seems too far, but maybe there are other walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is the actual win condition, but the rule says ""key is win"", so the key must be touched. 

Another angle: the door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. If ""key is win"", maybe touching the door isn't necessary anymore. So focus on getting the key. 

Let me check the objects again. The key is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. The door is at 5 steps right and 2 steps down. So after getting the key, maybe the door opens, but since the rule is ""key is win"", touching the key should suffice. 

So the plan is:

- Move right past the wall blocking the path.

To do that:

- First, move right from the player's position to reach the wall.

Wait, the player's position is where the rule `baba` is located: 4 steps left and 2 steps down. So if I'm at that position, moving right would take me towards the key. But there's a wall at 1 step right. 

So step-by-step:

1. From Baba's position (4 left, 2 down), move right once to get to 3 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? The wall is at 1 step right, which would be 4 left -1 step right = 3 left, same y. So yes, the wall is at 3 left, 2 down from the origin? Maybe I'm mixing up the reference points. 

This is getting too tangled. Let's try to simplify. The key is to the right and down. There's a wall blocking the immediate right path. To get past it, push the wall. So move right twice: first to be next to the wall, then right again to push it. Then move right to the key. 

So the actions would be:

right (to get next to the wall)

right (to push the wall to the right)

right (to move past the wall)

right (again)

right (and so on until reaching the key)

But that might take several steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the wall is not stop, so I can walk over it. Wait, no, walls are typically stop unless overridden. But in this case, the active rules don't mention stop for these walls. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 steps left and 3 steps up, which is probably not relevant here. So maybe these walls can be walked over, but actually, in Baba Is You, walls are stop by default unless a rule says otherwise. Since there's a ""stop"" rule elsewhere, but it's not applied to these walls, maybe they are not stop. 

Wait, the rule `stop` is a property. If a wall has the stop property, you can't move through it. So I need to check if any of the walls here have the stop property. Looking at the objects:

- The wall at 1 step right: no rule says it's stop, except maybe the general stop rule. Wait, there's a rule `stop` at 2 step left and 3 step up. That rule might be applying to another wall. The walls listed are:

wall 4 step up

wall 3 step up

wall 2 step up

wall 1 step up

wall 1 step down

wall 2 steps down

wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down

So most of these walls are along the upper path and lower path. The ""stop"" rule is at a different position, so maybe it doesn't affect these walls. Therefore, these walls might not be stop, meaning I can walk over them or push them. 

If I can walk over them, then I can move right past them without pushing. But in that case, why is there a wall blocking the path? Maybe there's a stop rule I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the wall at 1 step right is stop. Let me check the active rules again. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". There's no ""wall is stop"" rule active, so walls are not stop by default. Wait, but in Baba Is You, the default is that walls are stop unless a rule says otherwise. So if there's no rule saying ""wall is not stop"", then walls are stop. 

But in this level, the active rules don't include ""wall is stop"", so does that mean walls are not stop? That would be unusual. Maybe the ""stop"" rule mentioned in the objects is a property of some walls. Looking at the objects:

There's a rule `stop` at 2 step left and 3 step up. That's a separate text block, not a rule that's active. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So the walls in the map may or may not have the stop property. 

This is tricky. If the walls are stop, I need to find a way around by pushing them or finding another path. If they're not stop, I can walk through. 

Given that the player is Baba and ""baba is you"", and the key is the win condition, the most probable solution is to move to the key, which is at 4 steps right and 1 step down. The path is blocked by a wall at 1 step right. Assuming that wall is stop, I need to push it. To push it, move right twice: first to be next to it, then move right again to push it. 

So the sequence would be:

right (move to 1 step right)

right (push the wall to 2 steps right)

right (move past the wall)

Then continue right to the key at 4 steps right and 1 step down. 

But wait, the key's position is 4 steps right and 1 step down from the player's initial position. So after pushing the wall, moving right three more times would reach the key. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Once the key is obtained (by standing on it), the level is won. So the key is at (4, -1) relative to the player. 

Another possibility: Maybe the door is the win condition, but the rule says key is win, so the door's presence might be a red herring. 

In any case, the immediate action needed is to move right past the blocking wall. So the first action should be to move right to get next to the wall, then right again to push it. 

But the system requires choosing exactly one action. Since the user's previous attempts resulted in failures, perhaps the correct first step is to move right to reach the wall. 

Looking at the current observation after the last action, the player is likely at a position where moving right will lead to the wall. So the next action should be right to push it or move past. 

Wait, in the last observation provided, the player's position is rule `baba` 5 step to the left and 2 steps down. So if the player moves right, they would be moving towards the key. 

But given the confusion with coordinates, maybe the best action is to move right to start moving towards the key and wall.

65,right,"<reasoning>
Let's try to figure out what to do here. The active rules are still ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, the goal is still to get the key, which is now acting as the win condition. But normally, you have to reach the door, but in this case, the key itself is win. However, maybe there's a way to change that.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a door at 3 steps to the right and 2 steps down. But the key is at 2 steps to the right and 1 step down. Wait, the key is win, so if I can get to the key, that would make me a win? Because ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"", so touching the key would make me a win, allowing me to pass through the door? Or does the key being win mean that grabbing it directly wins the level?

But in the previous steps, the user tried moving right multiple times but got stuck. Let me check the current observation again. The key is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. The door is at 3 steps right and 2 steps down. So the path to the door might be blocked by walls. 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 1 step left and 4 step up, then more walls going down. On the lower part, there's a wall at 1 step left and 2 steps down. So from Baba's current position (6 steps left and 2 steps down), to get to the key at 2 right and 1 down, that's moving right twice and down once. But there's a wall at 1 step left and 2 steps down, which might block the path. Wait, Baba is at 6 left, 2 down. The key is at 2 right (so 6-2=4 left) and 1 down (2+1=3 down). So the coordinates would be (4 left, 3 down). The walls around there: wall at 1 left and 2 down, so maybe that's a barrier. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to move the text blocks to change the rules. For example, if I can make ""baba is win"" instead of ""key is win"", then reaching the door would win. But how to do that? The existing rules are ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"". To change ""key is win"" to something else, I need to move the ""is"" and ""win"" text blocks. 

The ""key is win"" rule is composed of the rule at 2 left and 3 up: ""is"" at 3 step left and 4 step up, ""key"" at 4 right and 4 up, ""is"" at 5 right and 4 up, ""win"" at 6 right and 4 up. Wait, maybe I need to move the ""win"" text block. But the problem is that text blocks that are part of active rules might be immovable if they are defined as stop. Looking at the active rules, ""stop"" is at 2 left and 3 up. So any text block that's part of a stop rule might be immovable. 

Alternatively, if I can move the ""key is win"" rule apart and create a new rule like ""baba is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""key"", ""is"", and ""win"" text blocks. But since ""key is win"" is an active rule, maybe I can break it by moving one of the components. For example, moving the ""win"" text block to a different position. 

Looking at the current objects, the ""win"" rule is at 4 steps to the right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""win"" text block and place it next to ""baba"" and ""is"", then I could create ""baba is win"". But how to move it? The user needs to move objects that are not STOP. The ""stop"" rule is at 2 left and 3 up, which might be a wall or part of another rule. So the ""win"" text block is probably not STOP, so I can move it. 

So the plan is: move the ""win"" text block from 4 right,4 up to be next to ""baba"" and ""is"" which are at 6 left,2 down area. But how to navigate there? The current position of Baba is at 6 left and 2 down. To move the ""win"" block, I need to go to where the ""win"" block is, which is 4 right and 4 up. From Baba's position, that's 4 steps right and 2 steps up. But along the way, are there walls blocking? 

Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, then another at 4 step up. So moving up from Baba's position (6 left, 2 down) to 4 up would require moving up 4 steps. But there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up. Wait, the walls are positioned at various points. Maybe there's a path. Let's see:

From Baba's position (6 left, 2 down), to reach the ""win"" block at 4 right,4 up:

First, move left 6 steps to get to the leftmost position, but that's probably not necessary. Alternatively, move right to reduce the left steps. Wait, the coordinates might be a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of steps relative to Baba's position. 

If Baba is at 6 step to the left and 2 steps down, that means his position is (6 left, 2 down). The ""win"" block is at 4 steps to the right and 4 steps up from Baba's position. So to reach it, Baba needs to move right 4 times and up 4 times. But along the way, are there walls?

Looking at the walls listed:

- Wall at 4 step up (from the top?), but also walls at 1 step right and 4 up, 1 step right and 3 up, etc. So moving up from Baba's position, there are walls at certain points. For example, when moving up 4 steps, at each step up, there's a wall at 1 step right and 4 up, which might be in the way. 

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach: since the key is win, maybe just go grab the key. The key is at 2 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. So moving right 2 and down 1. But is there a wall blocking that path? 

Baba's position is 6 left, 2 down. Moving right 2 would take him to 4 left, 2 down. Then down 1 to 4 left, 3 down. Are there walls there? The wall at 1 step left and 2 steps down is near, but that's 1 left, 2 down, which is different from Baba's path. The wall at 1 step left and 2 steps down is to the left of Baba's current position. So moving right 2 and down 1, there's no wall mentioned in that direction. The key is at 2 right,1 down, and the objects there are the key and the rule blocks for ""baba is you"". 

If Baba moves right twice and down once, he can pick up the key. Since ""key is win"", touching the key would make him a win, allowing him to pass through the door? Or does grabbing the key immediately win the level? In some Baba levels, touching the win object (like a key) wins the game. So if the key is win, then touching it should complete the level. 

But in the previous steps, when the user tried moving right, they got stuck. Maybe the path to the key is blocked. Let me check the current objects again. 

The key is at 2 steps right and 1 step down. So from Baba's position (6 left,2 down), moving right 2 to 4 left,2 down, then down 1 to 4 left,3 down. Are there any walls in that area? The walls are listed as:

- wall 1 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the right
- wall 1 step to the right and 1 step down
- wall 1 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 1 step to the left and 2 step up
- wall 1 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 1 step to the left
- wall 1 step to the left and 1 step down
- wall 1 step to the left and 2 steps down

So in the area around 4 left,3 down, are there walls? The closest walls are at 1 step left and 2 steps down, which is further left, and 1 step right and 2 steps down, which is to the right. So the path to the key (4 left,3 down) seems clear. 

Therefore, the correct action would be to move right twice and down once. But the system requires a single action. So first, move right twice to get to the key's horizontal position, then down once. But since each action is one step, the user needs to sequence the moves. However, in the current observation, the user's previous actions may have led to a different position. Wait, the last observation before this one had Baba at 5 step to the left and 2 steps down after moving right. Now, in the current observation, the key's position is 2 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position. 

So the correct sequence would be: first, move right to get to the key's horizontal position, then down. But the system requires choosing a single action. So the next immediate action should be to move right, then right again, then down. But since we can only choose one action at a time, the first step is to move right once. 

Wait, looking at the current observation's objects, the key is at 2 steps right and 1 step down from Baba's position (6 left,2 down). So to reach the key, Baba needs to move right 2 times and down 1 time. But in the current step, the user needs to choose one action. So the first action should be to move right. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is already in reach. Let me confirm the positions again. If Baba is at 6 step left and 2 down, moving right once would take him to 5 left, 2 down. Then right again to 4 left, 2 down. Then down once to 4 left, 3 down, where the key is. So the first action needed is to move right. 

However, in the previous steps, moving right led to changes in the map's active rules. For example, when the user moved right previously, the wall positions changed. Maybe moving right again will shift the rules again. 

Alternatively, maybe after moving right, the ""key is win"" rule gets activated, and Baba can then move to the key. 

But given the current observation, the correct action to take is to move right towards the key. So the chosen action should be ""right"".

66,right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure this out. The goal is to reach the door, which is currently defined as the ""win"" object. But in the active rules, it says ""key is win"", so pressing the key makes it a win condition. However, the door is the win object here. Maybe I need to change the rules.

Looking at the objects on the map, there's a key located at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. If I can get to the key and press it, that might change the win condition. But how do I move there? 

Baba is ""you"", so I can move Baba. The walls are blocking some paths. The current position of Baba is at 7 steps to the left and 2 steps down, as per the rule `baba` 7 step to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba is at (left 7, down 2). The key is at (right 1, down 1). 

I need to move right from Baba's position to reach the key. Let's see the path. Moving right once would take Baba to right 0, down 2. Then maybe right again to right 1, down 2. But wait, are there any walls in the way? Looking at the objects, there's a wall at 2 steps to the left and 2 steps down, which is to the left of Baba's current position. So moving right from Baba's position (left 7, down 2) to right 0, down 2 is possible if there's no wall there. 

Wait, the walls listed are at various positions. For example, wall 2 step to the left and 4 step up, etc. Maybe the path to the key isn't blocked. So moving right twice would get me to the key's location. Once I press the key, the rule ""key is win"" would make the key the win object. Then, maybe the door becomes irrelevant, or pressing the key makes the key the target. 

Alternatively, after getting the key, I might need to move it to the door. But keys are usually not moved; you just need to reach them. Once the key is activated as the win condition, perhaps standing on it would win. But in this case, the key is down at 1 step right and 1 step down, while the door is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. 

Wait, after pressing the key, the active rule becomes ""key is win"", so maybe touching the key makes you win. So I need to reach the key, press it, and then maybe the door's role changes. Alternatively, once the key is pressed, the win condition is now the key itself, so standing on it would win. 

But how do you press the key? In Baba Is You, sometimes you have to touch an object to activate it. So moving right to the key's position and standing there would activate it. Then the win condition changes to the key. 

So the steps would be: move right twice from Baba's position (7 left, 2 down) to reach the key at (1 right, 1 down). Then, once there, the key becomes the win. Then, the door's position is at 2 steps right and 2 steps down. So from the key's position, moving down once would reach the door. But since the win condition is now the key, maybe standing on the key is enough. 

Wait, but the key is at 1 right, 1 down. If I move there, I would be on the key, which is now the win. So that would satisfy the win condition, right? So maybe after moving to the key, the game is won. 

But let me check the current active rules. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So if I touch the key, which is the win object, then I win. So the plan is to move to the key's location. 

But how do I move there? From Baba's current position at 7 left, 2 down, moving right once would be to 6 left, 2 down. Then right again to 5 left, 2 down. Wait, but the key is at 1 right and 1 down. Maybe the coordinate system is a bit confusing. Let me parse the positions again. 

The rule `baba` is at 7 step to the left and 2 steps down. So Baba's position is (x: -7, y: -2) if left is negative and down is negative. The key is at 1 step to the right (x: +1) and 1 step down (y: -1). So from Baba's position, moving right twice (each step right increases x by 1) would get to x= -7 + 2 = -5, which is still left of the key's x=1. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the coordinate system. 

Alternatively, perhaps ""step to the left"" means in the negative x direction, and ""step down"" is in the negative y direction. So the key is at (1, -1), and Baba is at (-7, -2). To get from (-7, -2) to (1, -1), the x difference is +8, y difference is +1. So moving right 8 steps and up 1 step. But looking at the walls, there are walls along the upper path. For example, walls at 2 step to the left and 4 step up, etc. But maybe there's a path. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a different quadrant. This is getting confusing. Let me list all the objects again to visualize the map. 

Current objects:
- rule `wall` at 7 left, 4 up
- wall at 2 left, 4 up
- rule `key` at 1 right, 4 up
- rule `is` at 2 right, 4 up
- rule `win` at 3 right, 4 up
- rule `is` at 5 left, 3 up
- rule `stop` at 4 left, 3 up
- wall at 2 left, 3 up
- wall at 2 left, 2 up
- wall at 2 left, 1 up
- wall at 2 left
- wall at 2 left, 1 down
- key at 1 right, 1 down
- rule `baba` at 7 left, 2 down
- rule `is` at 6 left, 2 down
- rule `you` at 5 left, 2 down
- wall at 2 left, 2 down
- door at 2 right, 2 down

So the map is divided into a grid. Let's assume that the positions are relative. Baba is at 7 left and 2 down. The key is at 1 right and 1 down. So to get to the key, Baba needs to move right and down. 

From Baba's position (7 left, 2 down):
- Moving right once would take to 6 left, 2 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the walls: there's a wall at 2 left, 4 up, etc., but not at 6 left. So that's clear.
- Moving right again to 5 left, 2 down. Still no wall mentioned here.
- Continue moving right until reaching 0 left, 2 down. Then right once more to 1 right, 2 down. But the key is at 1 right, 1 down. So from there, need to move down once. 

But between 1 right, 2 down and 1 right, 1 down, is there a wall? The walls listed are at 2 left, various positions, but nothing at 1 right. So moving down from 1 right, 2 down to 1 right, 1 down would reach the key. 

Once there, pressing the key would make ""key is win"" active, so touching the key would win. Therefore, the action should be to move right until reaching the key's location. 

But the previous attempts had the assistant moving right multiple times, but the observation changes indicate that moving right alters the positions of the rules. For example, when moving right, the rules might shift, changing their positions. This is a key mechanic in Baba Is You: moving text blocks changes their positions, which can alter the rules. 

Wait, in the current observation, after moving right, the positions of the rules might change. For example, when the assistant moved right earlier, the rule `baba` shifted to 4 step to the left instead of 5, and other rules moved accordingly. So each movement can cause the entire grid to shift, changing the positions of all objects. 

This complicates things because the map's layout changes with each move. Therefore, the assistant needs to account for the shifting positions when planning the path. 

In the latest observation, after several right moves, the rule `baba` is now at 7 step to the left and 2 steps down, and the key is at 1 step to the right and 1 step down. The door is at 2 steps to the right and 2 steps down. 

So the current plan is to move right to reach the key. However, each move right will shift all the rules and walls to the left, effectively changing their relative positions. 

Let me think step by step. Current position of Baba: 7 left, 2 down. Key is at 1 right, 1 down. 

If I move right once, Baba moves to 6 left, 2 down. The rules will shift left by one step. So the rule `baba` becomes 6 left, 2 down. The key, which was at 1 right, 4 up, would now be at 0 right, 4 up (since the entire grid shifted left). Wait, no. When you move an object right, the grid shifts left for the other objects. This is a bit tricky. 

Alternatively, when you move an object (like a text block) right, the entire grid shifts left relative to that object. So moving a rule right would cause other rules and walls to shift left. 

This means that each time you move right, the positions of the other objects shift left by one step. Therefore, to reach the key, which is initially at 1 right and 1 down, you might need to move right multiple times, but each move will shift the key's position left by one. 

Wait, this is a critical point. When you move a text block (like a rule), the entire grid shifts in the opposite direction. For example, if you move a rule to the right, all other objects shift to the left. So the key's position relative to Baba would change dynamically. 

In the current observation, the key is at 1 right and 1 down from Baba's position. If I move right once, the key's position would shift to 0 right and 1 down (since the grid shifted left). But actually, the key's absolute position doesn't change; it's the grid that shifts. So if Baba moves right, the key remains in the same place, but from Baba's new position, the key is now one step to the left. 

This is confusing. Let me clarify with an example. Suppose Baba is at position (0,0). There's a key at (2,0). If I move Baba right to (1,0), the key is still at (2,0), so from Baba's new position, the key is 1 step to the right. But if there's a wall at (1,0), moving right would be blocked. 

However, in Baba Is You, when you move a text block, the entire grid shifts. So if you move a rule to the right, all other objects (including other rules and walls) shift to the left. This means that the positions are relative to the moved text block. 

This complicates pathfinding because the layout changes with each move. To handle this, the assistant must plan moves that account for the shifting grid. 

In the current situation, the key is at 1 right and 1 down from Baba. To reach it, Baba needs to move right and down. However, each right move will shift the grid left, altering the positions. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is in a fixed position on the screen, and moving right moves Baba towards it. But I think it's the former: moving objects shifts the grid. 

Given this, the correct approach might be to move right enough times to bring the key into Baba's reachable area without triggering walls. 

Alternatively, since the key is defined as ""win"", and the initial rule is ""key is win"", pressing the key would make touching it the win condition. Therefore, the goal is to reach the key's position. 

Given the shifting grid, the number of steps needed to reach the key might vary. However, based on the latest observation, the key is at 1 right and 1 down from Baba. So moving right once and down once should get there. 

But need to check for walls. From Baba's current position (7 left, 2 down), moving right once to 6 left, 2 down. Then right again to 5 left, 2 down. Continue until reaching 1 right, which would be 7 left + steps right. Wait, this is getting too confusing. 

Perhaps the best approach is to keep moving right until the key is in reach, then down. But given the previous failed attempts, maybe there's a different strategy. 

Another possibility is to change the rules. For example, create a new rule like ""baba is win"" to make Baba the win condition, allowing him to touch the door. But to do that, you need to move the text blocks ""baba"", ""is"", and ""win"" together. 

Looking at the current rules, ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"". The ""you"" rule is at 5 left, 2 down. The ""baba"" rule is at 7 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 6 left, 2 down. To create ""baba is win"", you need to move the ""win"" rule (which is at 3 right, 4 up) near the ""baba is you"" rule. 

But moving the ""win"" rule down and right would require moving past walls. For example, the ""win"" rule is currently at 3 right, 4 up. To get it to align with ""baba is you"", which is at 7 left, 2 down, you'd need to move it down 6 steps and right 10 steps, which is impossible due to walls. 

Alternatively, maybe you can move the ""key is win"" rule to become ""baba is win"". To do that, you'd need to detach ""key is win"" into ""baba is win"". But that requires rearranging the text blocks. 

For example, the current ""key is win"" is composed of three text blocks: ""key"", ""is"", ""win"". If you can move ""baba"" next to ""is"" and ""win"", then you can create ""baba is win"". 

The ""baba"" rule is at 7 left, 2 down. The ""is"" rule is at 6 left, 2 down. The ""win"" rule is at 3 right, 4 up. To move ""win"" down to align with ""is"", you'd have to move it down several steps, possibly pushing past walls. 

However, there are walls at 2 left, 4 up, 3 step up, etc., which might block the path. This seems complicated. 

Alternatively, since the key is the win object, maybe the fastest way is to reach the key. Given the previous attempts where moving right shifted the grid, perhaps the key is always reachable by moving right a certain number of times. 

In the latest observation, after moving right multiple times, the key is now at 1 step to the right and 1 step down from Baba. So moving right once would bring Baba to the key's x position, then down once to reach the key. 

But need to ensure there are no walls in between. From Baba's position at 7 left, 2 down, moving right once to 6 left, 2 down. Then right again to 5 left, 2 down. Continue until x reaches 1 right. Since each move right shifts the grid left, the key's position relative to Baba changes. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 1 right and 1 down, maybe moving right once and down once would reach it. But considering the grid shifts, this might not be straightforward. 

Given the time I've spent and the previous failed attempts, I think the best action now is to move right to get closer to the key, as the door is blocked by walls and the key is the win condition. So the chosen action is ""right"".

67,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The goal is to get to the door, which is currently defined as ""win"" because the active rule is ""key is win"". But wait, the key is also a win? That might be part of the problem. Initially, the key is the win condition. But maybe I can change that.

Looking at the current objects, Baba is me (since ""baba is you""), so I can move. The door is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down from Baba's position. But there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down, and another wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So the path is blocked by walls. The key is at 1 step down, same level as the door but to the left. 

Hmm, maybe I need to get the key first. If I pick up the key, does that do anything? Since the key is win, maybe holding it makes me a win? But I don't know the exact mechanics. Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""key is win"" rule to make the door the win instead. 

Baba is you, so I can push text blocks if they're not stopped. The rule ""key is win"" is at 4 step up. If I can move that rule, maybe I can change the win condition to the door. But the wall at 3 step to the left and 3 step up is a STOP, so I can't move past that. 

Wait, the key is at 1 step down. If I go down to get the key, then maybe I can carry it and use it to modify the rules. But how? Once I have the key, maybe I can place it near a rule. For example, if I can move the ""is"" text next to ""door"" and ""win"", then ""door is win"" would make the door the win. 

But moving the text blocks requires them not to be stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 5 step to the left and 3 step up. So I need to avoid that. Let's map out the positions. 

Baba is at 8 step to the left and 2 steps down. The door is at 1 step to the right and 2 steps down. So to get to the door, I need to move right twice, but there's a wall at 3 step to the left and 2 steps down (wait, no, the walls are at 3 step left and 2 steps down, which is actually to Baba's left). Wait, the wall positions are:

- wall 3 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 3 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 2 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step up
- wall 3 step to the left (so same as 1 step up level)
- wall 3 step to the left and 1 step down

So the left side is completely blocked by walls from up to down. On the right side, there's a wall 1 step to the right and 2 steps down, which is directly next to the door. So the path to the door is blocked by that wall. 

But the key is at 1 step down, same level as the door but to the left. If I go down to get the key, then perhaps I can use it to modify the rules. Let's see the rules:

- key is win (active)
- baba is you (active)

Other rules are wall, stop, is. 

If I can move the ""is"" text block that's next to ""key"" and ""win"" (at 4 step up, 1 step to the right), maybe I can create a new rule like ""door is win"". To do that, I need to move the ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"". 

But how to get there? The key is at 1 step down. So first, I need to move down to get the key. Let's check if that's possible. From Baba's position (8 left, 2 down), moving down once would take me to 8 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? Looking at the objects, the walls on the left are up to 3 step left and various ups and downs. The walls on the right include one at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So moving down from Baba's position (8 left, 2 down) to 8 left, 3 downâ€”no wall mentioned there. So that's possible. 

Once I have the key, maybe I can move it. But do I need the key to do anything? The key is already the win condition. Alternatively, maybe I can use the key to push other text blocks. But since the key is a win, maybe it's treated differently. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" text block that's at 5 steps to the right and 4 step up (from initial observations). Wait, in the current observation, the ""is"" blocks are at various positions. Let me check again:

Current objects:

- rule `wall` 8 step to the left and 4 step up
- wall 3 step to the left and 4 step up
- rule `key` 4 step up (position: not sure, but key is at 4 step up)
- rule `is` 1 step to the right and 4 step up
- rule `win` 2 steps to the right and 4 step up
- rule `is` 6 step to the left and 3 step up
- rule `stop` 5 step to the left and 3 step up
- walls descending from 3 step left and 3 up to 3 step left and 1 down
- key at 1 step down
- rule `baba` at 8 step left and 2 steps down
- other rules at 7,6,5 step left and 2 steps down
- wall at 3 step left and 2 steps down
- door at 1 step right and 2 steps down

So the ""is"" at 1 step to the right and 4 step up is next to ""key"" and ""win"". If I can move that ""is"" to be between ""door"" and ""win"", then ""door is win"" would activate. But where is the ""door"" text block? The door object is there, but is there a ""door"" rule? Not that I see. The door is an object, but to make it a win, we need a rule ""door is win"". 

So the plan is: 

1. Move down to get the key (position 1 step down).
2. Use the key to move other text blocks. But since I'm Baba and ""baba is you"", I can move text blocks that are not stopped. The ""stop"" rule is at 5 step left and 3 step up, so need to avoid that area.
3. Find the ""is"" text block at 1 step right and 4 step up. Maybe move it down to the door's level. But how to navigate there?

Alternatively, maybe move the ""win"" rule to be under ""door"". Currently, ""win"" is at 2 steps right and 4 step up. If I can move the ""win"" text to be next to ""door"", then ""door is win"" would be created. But how?

Another angle: Since the key is win, maybe picking up the key makes me a win? But I'm already a you (Baba is you). Maybe having the key allows me to push other blocks. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the door is behind a wall, but if I can remove the wall's stop property. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, maybe changing that to something else. But looking at the active rules, there's ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules are ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"", etc., but not sure if they're active rules or just objects. 

Wait, active rules are the ones that define properties. The initial active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules like ""wall"", ""is"", ""stop"" are probably objects on the map, not active rules. So to change a rule, I need to move existing text blocks to form new rules. 

So, to make ""door is win"", I need to have the text ""door"" next to ""win"" and ""is"". The ""win"" is currently next to ""key"" and ""is"". So if I can move the ""is"" to the left next to ""door"" and ""win"", that would work. But where is the ""door"" text block? The door object is present, but the text ""door"" is part of its rule. Wait, in the objects, there's a door, but to create a rule about door, I need a text block ""door"" somewhere. Looking at the objects, I don't see a text block ""door"". The rules are ""wall"", ""key"", ""is"", ""win"", etc. So perhaps the door's text is implicit, or maybe I need to create it by moving a text block next to it. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to check the level structure again. The key is win, so if I get the key, maybe that's enough? But the key is at 1 step down. If I go down to get it, then maybe I can place it near the door? But the door is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. From my current position (8 left, 2 down), moving down to 1 step down would be position 8 left, 3 down. Then move right to 7 left, 3 down, then right again to 6 left, 3 down, etc., but there's a wall at 3 step left and 2 steps down, which is to the left of the door. 

Alternatively, maybe I can move the ""is"" text block from 1 step right and 4 step up down to the door's level. Let's see: from 4 step up to 2 steps down, that's a big move. Each move is one step, so I would need to move the ""is"" block down four steps. But how? Since I'm a you, I can push text blocks if they're not stopped. The ""is"" block at 1 step right and 4 step up is not behind a stop, so I could potentially move it. 

But to move the ""is"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. Let's see. From Baba's position (8 left, 2 down), moving up to 4 step up would require several moves up. But there are walls at 3 step left and various ups, which might block the path. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the simplest way is to move towards the key, pick it up, and then see if that allows me to modify the rules. So first action: move down to get the key. 

But wait, the key is at 1 step down. From Baba's position (8 left, 2 down), moving down once gets me to 8 left, 3 down. Is there a wall there? The walls on the left are up to 3 step left and various positions, but the right side has a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So moving down to 3 down, right side is clear. So action: down. 

Once I have the key, maybe I can move it to the door's area. But the key is a win, so maybe carrying it doesn't help. Alternatively, use the key to push other blocks. For example, the ""is"" block at 1 step right and 4 step up. If I can move that ""is"" down to the door's level, I can create ""door is win"". 

To move the ""is"" block, I need to be next to it and push it. From Baba's position (8 left, 2 down), moving up to 4 step up would require passing through walls at 3 step left. For example, moving up from 8 left, 2 down to 8 left, 3 down (no wall), then 8 left, 4 down (wall at 3 step left, 4 up)â€”wait, the walls on the left are at 3 step left and 4 up. So moving up from 8 left would not hit a wall until reaching 3 step left. So perhaps it's possible to navigate up. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Since the key is win, and the door is the object we need to reach, maybe the key is a distraction. Perhaps the real solution is to change the win rule to door. To do that, we need to create ""door is win"" by moving the existing ""is"" next to ""door"" and ""win"". 

The ""win"" is currently at 2 steps right and 4 step up. The ""door"" is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. The ""is"" is at 1 step right and 4 step up. If we can move the ""is"" from (1 right, 4 up) to (door's position, which is 1 right, 2 down), but that's a diagonal move, which isn't allowed. Text blocks can only be moved horizontally or vertically adjacent. 

Alternatively, maybe move the ""win"" rule to be next to ""door"". The ""win"" is at 2 right, 4 up. To get it to the door's level (2 steps down), that's a lot of moves. Not practical. 

Another idea: The ""stop"" rule is at 5 left, 3 up. If I can remove that ""stop"" property, maybe the walls can be moved. But how? To remove a rule, you might need to break it apart. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, breaking it into ""wall is [something else]"" or moving the parts. But in the current active rules, there's no ""wall is stop"" explicitly. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other rules are objects like ""stop"", ""wall"", etc., but not active rules. 

Wait, the objects listed include ""rule `stop` 2 step to the left and 3 step up"". So that's a text block ""stop"" placed at that position. To change the property of wall from stop to something else, you might need to rearrange the rules. For example, if there's a ""wall is stop"" rule, you can move the ""stop"" text block away. But in the current setup, the active rules are only ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". The other text blocks like ""stop"", ""wall"", etc., are just placed on the map but not part of active rules. 

So maybe the walls are immovable because they're defined as stop? Or perhaps the ""stop"" text block is making certain areas immovable. This is getting a bit unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the solution is to turn yourself into a key. Since ""baba is you"" and ""key is win"", if I can make ""baba is key"", then I would be a key, and since key is win, reaching the key (which I am) would win. But how to create ""baba is key""? There's a ""baba"" rule at 8 left, 2 down, which is ""baba is you"". To change that to ""baba is key"", I need to move the ""you"" text block to ""key"". 

The ""you"" is at 5 left, 2 down. So if I can move the ""you"" from there to next to ""baba"" and ""key"", that would work. Let's see. The current ""baba is you"" is at 4 step left and 2 steps down for ""baba"", ""is"" at 3 step left, and ""you"" at 2 step left. To change it to ""baba is key"", I need to replace ""you"" with ""key"". 

The ""key"" text block is at 4 step up. So I would need to move the ""key"" down to the ""baba is"" rule area. From 4 step up to 2 steps down is a big move, but perhaps possible by pushing. 

Alternatively, move the ""you"" block to the right next to ""key"". For example, from its current position at 5 left, 2 down, move it right to 4 left, 2 down, next to ""key"". But the ""key"" is at 4 step up, not at 2 down. This seems complicated. 

Maybe the best approach is to move towards the key, pick it up, and then use it to modify the rules near the door. So:

1. Move down from (8 left, 2 down) to (8 left, 3 down).
2. Move down again to (8 left, 4 down). But wait, the wall is at 3 left, 4 up. Not sure about the vertical layout. Maybe it's better to move horizontally. 

Alternatively, since the key is at 1 step down, which is same level as the door, maybe I can move right to get to the door. But the path is blocked by a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. 

Wait, the door is at 1 step right and 2 steps down. There's a wall at 1 step right and 2 steps down. So to reach the door, I need to remove that wall's stop property or move the wall. But the wall is a separate object; changing its property would require a rule like ""wall is not stop"". 

But how to create that rule? The active rules don't include anything about wall's properties. The ""stop"" rule is at 5 left, 3 up. So maybe if I can move the ""stop"" text block away, the walls wouldn't be stop anymore. 

For example, if I can move the ""stop"" block from (5 left, 3 up) to elsewhere, then the wall's stop property would be removed. But how to do that? 

To move the ""stop"" block, I need to be adjacent to it and push it. The ""stop"" is at 5 left, 3 up. From Baba's position (8 left, 2 down), the distance is 3 left and 1 up. So need to move left three times and up once. But there are walls at 3 left, various positions. For example, moving left from 8 left to 7 left, then 6, then 5. At 5 left, 3 up is the ""stop"" block. But moving there requires passing through walls. 

The walls on the left are at 3 left and 4 up, 3 left and 3 up, etc. So moving left from 8 to 5 left would pass through 6,7,5 left. At 5 left, 3 up is the ""stop"" block. But to get there,","

Let's see. The active rules are ""key is win"" and ""baba is you"". So, I need to get the key because it's considered the win condition. But how?

Looking at the objects, there's a key at 1 step down. Wait, the player is at the rule 'baba' which is at 8 steps left and 2 steps down. The key is right next to that. But there's a wall 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Wait, no, the player is at 8 steps left and 2 down. The key is 1 step down from there. So moving right once should get to the key.

Wait, but can I move right? The rules say ""baba is you"", so I'm Baba. The walls are defined as stop, but I can move through objects unless they are stop. However, the key is win, but I need to pick it up? Or is just being on the key enough?

In Baba Is You, sometimes you have to touch the object to claim the rule. Since the key is win, if I touch it, does that make me win? Or do I need to move the 'win' rule to myself? Wait, the current rule is 'key is win', so touching the key should make me win, right? Because the rule says key is win, and I'm Baba (you). So if I go to the key, I win.

But the key is at 1 step down from my current position. So moving down once should get me there. Let me check the path. The player's position is at rule 'baba' which is 8 left, 2 down. The key is 1 step down from there. Are there any walls in the way? The walls are at 3 steps left and various positions up, but between me and the key, it's clear. So moving down once should reach the key. Then, since key is win, touching it should make me win. So the action should be down.
