Let's try to figure out the solution here. The goal is normally to become the WIN object, right? But looking at the active rules, it says ""key IS WIN"", which changes the win condition to the key instead. So I need to get to the key.

Now, the objects on the map: There's a key located 1 step to the right from my current position. But wait, am I Baba? The active rules also state ""BABA IS YOU"", so yes, I'm Baba, which means I can move around. But I have to check if there are any STOP properties or other immovable things blocking my path.

Looking at the map description, there's a ball 3 steps to the left and 2 steps down. Not sure if that's relevant. The key is one step to the right, so maybe I just need to move right. But wait, can I move the key? No, the key is a regular object unless there's a rule that allows it to be moved. Since the only rules are about key being win, and baba being you, I can move the key if it's not blocked by STOP. Let me check if any objects are STOP.

Looking at the objects again, there's no mention of any STOP properties here. So maybe the path is clear. The key is 1 step to the right, so moving right once should get me there. Once I reach the key, since the key is WIN, that would complete the level. So the action should be right.
